# 2016

## 2016-01-01

The little white boxes, the date up here, everything looks white and empty.

I feel a strange void inside. With what could I fill it? Why should it be filled?

What if that emptiness and sadness is a part of who I am? What if taking it out is breaking myself? I am the person who I've been building this 23 years. Be it a mask or a persona, I am who I am.

I feel loneliness. I am lonely. Yesterday I drank. I didn't this much last week. I planned to drink only two glasses of wine. I drank a glass of white, another of red and half of the sweet one we picked up in Tecate. I drank a little cup of Edgar's porter beer. I drank another two big glasses of the sweet wine and then a cup of chocolate with irish cream in it.

They were talking and laughing and I felt dead inside. I remember those kind of parties. Those were my kind of parties for a time. Being nonexistent in a room filled with people. Wandering between laughs seeing their faces and hearing their voices masked in laughter. Drinking and emptying my glass. Drowning and hiding myself from existence.

I've always felt some scorn with everyone who can pass the holidays with their loved ones. Christmas, new year's eve, once again they left me this bitter taste in my mouth. Is difficult to think I missed these nights. I saw Chevo and Jessica's picture and I hated them for an instant. I envied them. They are with their loved ones.

I don't have those.

I have Catherine and that's it.

I sent her a text message answering the one she sent me. She informed me of the new year. I answered back with an echo of her own words. How was I then? There was playing another movie which couldn't distract me any more.

I didn't say anything. I saw the time and kept silence. Every one of those hugs was like a stab in the stomach. Like the feeling of a slap in my face. It wasn't the misery I felt that night when I realized I needed the antidepressants. It was that guilt and sorrow that covered me in a wave that came from every one of their looks. This was different. It was remembering they don't know me.

I'm not being dramatic. I can't be loved by someone who doesn't really know me. They know Ivan. They think they know him. They hugged him. That weird, long haired older son of Laura, the daughter of Cande. The shy boy and serious young man.
They might think they love me and not even all of them.

My aunt and uncle prepared special food for me. Would they even welcome me in their house if they knew how I am?

I don't want people to think of me with some kind of disease or perversion and yet I refer to it as if it were a nightmare. A couple of weeks ago I wrote it wasn't even a problem. I was hopeful and wouldn't let anything stand in my way.

What happened? Why do I feel this way?

Why do I want nothing more than to close my eyelids and let my tears stealthily escape, to stand up and walk towards the little fridge in the living room and grab a bottle of beer. I won't make myself stupid, I won't drink myself to sleep. I just want to erase these feelings. Grab one, maybe two, at most, and drink them slowly. Enjoy the dark and bitter taste of that dark ale. Dark and bitter like the feeling I want to get rid of.

This is the first day of 2016 and I'll end it in tears.

"I understand you, sometimes I think I just belong with you and it scares me. And then I look at myself and realize that I can talk to Miguel, and it scares me so much more because I can't even imagine how do you feel"

We came her from the United States. I ordered 10 pieces of chicken nuggets even though I ate more than I should. I still haven't finished my diet 7up and yet I flirt with the idea of grabbing the beer. I went to bed a couple of minutes shy from 6 in the morning. I was awoke when the door was banged. The first time I did get up, I let the cat in. The second and third I pretended to be asleep.

Most of the way home I was asleep.

I got home and opened the cellphone to see a notification from Paola Aguirre. She tagged myself in a picture with the other 6 people. I felt irritated. I read the description and it was an invitation to get together a day before my birthday to celebrate the king's day.

Paola said she would go and so did Catherine and Anahi. I didn't want to go. I didn't want to be near them. I remembered Chevo and Jessica and I don't want to see them nor talk to them. Then I saw Paola's comment. "Wuu, I have three beautiful girls confirmed already, one more to go and two wild creatures."

She doesn't know about me. Do I want to tell her? Do I really want to open up to another person? Is that what I need right now? I can't be in another room full of people who don't know me.

"You can not go, Sofi" "No, no I cannot".

I feel lonely, I wouldn't let myself live with the idea of isolating myself again. I have to go. It's not what I want nor what I need, but it's the closest I 'll ever get. They are the last "loved ones" I have left.

I have to try. Even if it keeps killing me from the inside and makes the void bigger and darker.

## 2016-01-02

I didn't took my pill today.

Is this how I want to start my year? Yesterday I feel that dark passenger again. I just now remembered that reference. That's how Dexter calls his psychopathic desire. He disassociates himself from his urge to kill making a dark persona which obliges him. I saw the series when I was in jr high. I was not nor am a psychopath. I am not even close. I was depressed and identified with his affective flattening. I was an impressionable young mind and identified with anything that could give an explanation to what I was feeling at the moment.

I don't know how to feel right now with the idea that a 14 year old boy prefers to identify with a serial murderer than a woman. I guess to me was more acceptable to be an actual monster than a transgender person.

I woke up a little before noon. I stood up and went to break fast. I ate the biscuit my father bought for me and then returned to bed. I can't recall if I dreamed something. I keep repeating those words in my mind. Every time I try to relive them they lose a little of their meaning. I can see the man and the baby but he mumbles now. His words don't mean anything. He looks at me and his lips move but I disappear. What did he say? "Look at the girl" is with my memory dictates. When I see it I don't hear no words anymore. He looks at me and they both smile. He points at me but stops at "Look", there is nobody there. I don't exist. They both look at a phantom.

"You say you like it but at the same time that it makes you feel fake", "it's like if it were something that I don't deserve".

"So, you don't deserve that people look at you this way, to be this way... are you going to punish yourself by going back to being Ivan?"

"No. No..."

I didn't get up again until after 3 in the afternoon. My parents both were in the living room. I almost forgot. Yesterday in bed I again had a secret affair with the temptation of telling my dad. I invited the idea to bed, let her get inside the sheets and embraced my in her arms. I closed my eyes and touched her body, held her as close as our bodies would let us. She got inside me and I imagined again standing in front of him. "Dad, I am trans".

I don't bother myself with a lengthy explanation or an easier introduction. I go straight to the point. I want to get it out of my system and get it over with. I stop thinking after that. After the words left my chest after it is known I don't want to imagine anything more. I don't want to fantasize about a reaction nor an answer. I don't want to draw him a face in my subconscious. I don't want to expect anything.

Today is saturday. Everybody goes back to their routine in a couple of days. My father will be the first one to return to everyday life Monday. Then Luis and my mother will go back to school in Wednesday.

Chevo answered Paola's post. He can't on Wednesday. He already has plans but he will change them. It's a date, I guess. I confirmed myself. Even if I had not said anything I'd give the same answer today.

What will I wear?

Who will I be?

I thought about that, too. How will Paola react? Will there be any comments of separation again? Boys and girls. Men and women. What if they see my phone? I tried to change the wallpaper in the morning. I wasn't going to put a tamer picture. I actually wanted a more obvious one.

Will I say something? We were going to talk to them. Catherine would, anyway. Will I?

They don't know my name. I can't tell them at the same time that I tell Paola about me. Will I tell her my name, too? Do I actually want to say it to any of them?

She has a baby now. Will she think I am a bad influence? Will her parents?

I feel lonely. I feel isolated. I am scared of asking for help.

"The important thing is that you know you have the support of your loved ones" that's what the other paola said to me.

Sure, it would be if I knew who they were.

## 2016-01-03

I was tempted to climb out of bed resigned and come here to type the words of today.

"My heart is wild and full of energy. Like a furious tiger throwing himself against the cells that hold him caged. It jumps and growls. It goes from here to there. His roar is full and strong. His movements quick and precise." I felt pulses of energy that wouldn't let me still. I wanted to get up and run. "I don't know from what to escape nor where to go"

I considered, too, getting up and going to the living room and played in the silence and darkness of the night. I could wake up early and readjust my own sleep schedule. I fell asleep near 4 in the morning. I woke up like 4 hours later. Was there some breakfast? No. Someone was in the living room. There were sounds of life. It wasn't Luis nor my father. Miguel was awake. I didn't know if the stole my idea or he did get up early. I was sad and tired. I feel like a failure. I wanted nothing. In the night I could smell my own stench but had no energy nor motivation to clean myself. The first thing I decided to do was to shower and shave. I'd shave everything. My chest, my pits, my legs and my face. I wanted to be clean and presentable. I took a pair of black underwear and chose it even though there were no plans for today.

Did I broke fast or showered first? I showered first. Luis and my father were downstairs when I prepared my food. Luis was cooking himself some soup and chicken. I heated the biscuit I left from yesterday. Last night my mother prepared the beans with bacon and chorizo. There were some slices from then. I threw the egg and made another one fresh. I put the bacon and a slice of ham. I ate it even before Luis started.

I am listening to an album of mexican music played as flamenco. I am drinking hot chocolate in a paper cup. Yesterday I drank a bottle of beer. Was it yesterday or the day before? Today is Sunday. Yesterday was saturday. It was yesterday, the day before was when we returned home.

My mother had mentioned going today to the united states. Did I thought of that when I decided to get ready?

"Are you going out?", my father questioned me. "No", I said.

I keep thinking of the words which I'll choose to invite him to know me.

"I never told you why I am taking the antidepressants. I do know. I don't like my body. I don't like being a man. I am not one. I am trans", here is, I think, where I wouldn't be able to hold the tears and break, "I want to change it. Please don't judge me, don't hate me, don't leave me".

I've been thinking about those words months by now. I almost can't believe I never got to wrote them down.

Tomorrow was supposed to be the day I'd call the endocrinologist. I was thinking of that yesterday, too.

"Hello, I'm looking for dr Magallanes? ... Yeah, my name is..." That's where I stop. Which is my name? Am I Ivan or am I Sofia? Which voice will I use? Which is the lie and which is the truth? The doubt burns me inside and shuts me down.

"Yeah, I'm a trans person. I looked up your contact info in a list of recommendations to the trans community. I am looking for someone who could help me with Hormone Replacement Therapy. I wanted to know if you could help me or give me some information about it."

I am scared. I feel I'm betraying my own family going out looking for him. Doing it without asking for their help. I have the money to pay for the first consultation. I have the motivation and readiness to really start and do it. I have the strong will to fight for who I am.

But I am not ready. I am not ready to do it by myself. I do need their help.

There lies my fear. I need them. I don't know what I'd do without their support.

I asked my mother about going to the United States. My father was irritated about going. Today is his last day of vacations. I understand him.

I felt hideous. I chose the wrong clothes. I wanted to look for new items.

"What do I buy?

"I don't know, you're with your parents and brothers"

"It doesn't matter, maybe I won't care"

"Then a blouse or flats... a purse"

"No, I do care."

I looked at the purses but found nothing. I liked none. They were colorful and big. Notorious. Like a big signal asking to be seen. I saw the clothes when my mother looked for some herself. I wandered by my own and found nothing. Even the sunglasses were all ugly.

Luis bought a pair, my mother two. My mother found a black, simple purse. I liked it. I saw it and felt envious. I couldn't even find male clothes in my size. I picked three long-sleeved shirts and a pair of black pants.

I tried them on and liked them. They are more ambiguous than my usual shirts.

 I may know what to wear wednesday and thursday.

Will I call? Will he answer? Will I dare to speak? To the doctor? my father? Luis?

"You area away in a trip. I know you won't see this soon, I don't expect you to answer. I know I've been an asshole. It's not your fault. Everything will be normal when you're back. I am sorry."

"Three days later I answered back... Not because I didn't have wifi, I wanted to scream it all. Hilda read it the day I received it. The hostal was crap. There was just wifi in the lobby and in one pc. Hilda was in the computer and she asked me if I wanted to use it. I told her no, I had nothing to check. At the end I sat and when I opened your notification popped up.
She asked me if I wanted her to leave, I answered her no. I read it and then she did.
'See? everything will be alright. You're almost back, it's the distance...' I don't know what else. I closed everything and we left. I remember that the 'normal' part was what I didn't like."

"Can I tell you something?...
Ok, I don't know how, haha.
When I see/read that, it hurts me, a lot. Sometimes it angers me. It's very weird. I remember when we start going to the hotel, when I called you April. I, then, saw you as two different persons.
I liked the girl, I wanted her. The boy was forbidden for me. He was my friend. I think once I've told it before.
...What I wanted to say is that I loved Ivan very very much. He was my best friend, like none other. He was fun and a creep, stalker and he loved gossip... he was complicated. We was too many things.
He hurt me, and maybe I hurt him. But, in truth, I don't resent him. I missed him too much, I needed him a lot.
Sometimes I remember him. In some I laugh and in others I cry. There is always affection in the memories. I feel I never said good bye to my friend. I really felt he never returned from Spain. I wanted to say it, that I loved him and he was special to me.

...

I read it and I feel crazy, but it's true, since the beginning I saw you as two persons. Then I didn't know who returned from Spain...
But I met you a year ago, Sofi. When RenÃ© cancelled you and you invited me to lunch. Maybe it is the same humor, some jokes... I don't know. It was different. Since the beginning of 2015 you were SofÃ­a to me. Funny, amusing, fragile, a gossiper and creepy, sensitive... Someone whom I'm crazy about."

She found a screen cap of the message I sent her when she was in Argentina. I finished with the pictures of Spain and the ones of my return. Now, I don't remember exactly when I am. Maybe the beginnings of last year. I know I saw the changes in my body. I lost a lot of weight and I noticed how I started to gain it back. It looked as if I was morphing myself in the person I was before I left. I did look feminine in a certain way in the pictures of there. I had some facial hair. It wasn't as smooth as I remember, but there is something delicate in my face. I missed that person. The one who was happy and comfortable in his own skin. There was a secret but it didn't burned. That person lived inside a fantastical bubble where there existed no problems. The bubble was going to burst and reality was near. That person decided to be again the boy who arrived. It was easier to suffer again than to deal with it alone.

I imagined a lot how it would be dying. Taking my own life. There was a recurrent thought of never returning from Spain. I wouldn't be back. There were signals that Yolanda did sense. Gifts, mementos, good byes and speeches. When somebody kills himself, all of his problems stay behind. It's as if he escapes and the people left has to deal with everything he left behind. Everybody cleans the mess he left. He doesn't have to deal with anything. He's gone...

I killed myself in a way. But I did return, too. I have and will have to deal with everything. All the blame and responsibility of my actions. The guilt, the problems, I'm here to deal with everything.

Why would Monica want to talk to me if I took his best friend away?

"You took more than his friend"

I am scared. I didn't call today.

Will I tomorrow? Will I ever?

Is it really easier staying this way than to face my fears?

## 2016-01-05

Catherine asked me in the morning if I could go with her to do her driving test. She would come pick me up at 8 in the morning. My mother and Luis would be getting ready too for their appointment for their passport. At the end, we postponed it to tomorrow. Tomorrow will be sixth of january. King's day. I'll go to Paola's house. I haven't decided what I'll wear. Everybody but my father will be at home. Do I care?

We were all in the living room when the Trevor Noah's daily show was on. The special guest was David Cross, the actor who played Tobias FÃ¼nke in Arrested Development. That show made me laugh so many times. I recommended it to Monica several times. She would blew me off several times too until she caved in. Game of Thrones was the last show she saw because of me. He was talking about his last show. He is the protagonist in a British-american series. "What is it about?", he was asked.

Nobody knows. I didn't know about it nor my dad or Miguel. He started making the synopsis talking nonsense. I was smiling, I was still in the mood from his last jokes about the republican candidates. "Is about a man in a farm who is trans, and starts to transform himself in a horse"

Everybody laughs and my smile fades away. Did they notice?

I dreamed about telling my dad. We were in a fancy hotel. I remember being alone in the room. There was a weird, long, red and cylindrical bag with a special watch inside. My father parked a red, flashy sports car inside the hall. In the night I stepped out of the room looking for the restroom. Was I looking for the women's? I remember finding it but still looking. I asked someone and they directed me towards another door, but that wasn't a bathroom, it was a computer room. Like a cafe internet.

I returned to the room. I remember having the urges to masturbate. When I woke up I tried to remember the last time I did. I can't I don't know. Today is 5th, so it's at least a week.

I haven't written about the important part of the dream. Is it an unconscious wish to forget it? It was nothing bad or painful. We were lying in bed. Maybe there was a tv or something. The room was dark but not pitch black. He started the conversation with a question born from interest and curiosity. "Did Catherine fight with her dad? Was she upset or something like that?" I can't remember if he mentioned the name of my mother or any other person. "[...] something about she hasn't tell him".

I could feel the light go up. The moment of truth, the insight. This could be it. I could say it now. I felt thrilled and happy. I was excited and scared. I see myself smiling now that I remember, but in the dream I could not see my face.

I was going to start, I had the words ready to come out. Everything was set in motion. I think the first ones did make appearance when I turned and I realized I was alone. He was gone. Nobody was there.

I don't know if it was some kind of glitch. I remember the feeling of seeing him again. The thankfulness of a second opportunity. Just when I opened my mouth to start again, he again was gone. I woke up after that.

Will he be gone when I decide to finally do it?

I woke up with the dream, the doubt about my masturbation habits and the realization that it was late and early at the same time. I stayed in the living room playing assassin's creed until 5 in the morning. Just now I'm realizing I was scared of falling asleep, of it being today. The fear woke up with me. I remember thinking about that falling asleep. What would I wear tomorrow or in my birthday. Would I say anything to Paola about me? Would I mention the name now?

With what words could I open up in the telephone when I call the doctor?

How would I introduce myself, ask him for help. I know his name but he doesn't know mine. Do I have to tell him? I'll tell him my deepest secret which not even my father knows.

"Hello, is this the dr Javier Magallanes?... Hi, I'm *Ivan*, you are an endocrinologist, right? I saw your name and contact in a list of recommended services for the trans community. I am trans myself and looking forward to start HRT. I wanted to know if you could help me?"

I couldn't. I woke up and time passed by while I stayed hidden under a blanket in my couch killing templars.

I am frustrated and angry. Maybe Catherine is as well. She doesn't understand the fear I have. Anahi asked if she were angry with her. It appears she will go tomorrow after all.

Why aren't I excited? Why am I stilled scared?

What is it that I fear?

How can I fight it if I'm blind? How can I ask for help if I'm mute?


## 2016-01-06

I woke up at 2:42am. I decided to sent Catherine a text message responding hers. I had asked about what to wear. I wanted to wear something feminine and I thought it would be easier to wear it today than tomorrow. I doubted because of Paola. When I woke up I was worked up in fears and expectations. I was angry of how ready I was to do anything. Late at night I feel reckless: I can tell my dad, I could go upstairs and wake him up and tell him. I could tell Luis about me and don't care about the consequences, it'll happen what will happen.

"Just think: will it be easier to be done at a later time? If not, you're just postponing it".

I could ask the endocrinologist and make an appointment. I could do anything. And as sure of that, I was sure that as the dawn breaks, my courage would break too.

I didn't fall asleep again. I haven't slept since then. I tossed and turned and wondered and thought and fantasized and worried and feared. I did everything but rest or sleep.

I wore the leggings. I wore the red new shirt. I put on make up, but just the foundation. It covered a little of the shadow on my face, but by the evening there were some signs of it. I felt ugly. I felt hideous. Nobody nor nothing could make me feel otherwise.

I didn't want to go or did I? I wanted to say it, maybe. I thought about it. I wanted to call the endocrinologist, too. I wanted a lot of things I couldn't do. Maybe that's why I hated myself. I feel caged in my own body. I absolutely hate that fucking phrase. What's the difference with what I feel? I'm not trapped in a wrong body. I'm trapped in a useless one, a broken one.

We went to take the driver's license. She did her test and passed it. I just answered some questions and payed. There was no printer so neither of us has our new plastics. I'm 800 pesos less. That's what the endocrinologist session will cost. It's less than the 60 dollars I had expected.

It's still a lot. Money I don't have. I do have it, but not more than for one session.

I did call. We broke fast in the torta plaza. We didn't want to spend and yet we bought the most expensive of the breakfasts. The sour cream on them made me a little sick. Or maybe it's just the storm of emotions that destroys me from the inside.

I read the words I type and they seem so pathetic. It's like reading the thoughts of a whiny little bitch. A little idiot who thinks the world conspires against her. God does have a plan, and its to make things as difficult and painful for me.

If I were him I would hate me, too.

I feel the tears be born in my eyes and I think I deserve them. I feel this pain and I want it. Why do I want to punish myself? What did I do that makes me think I actually deserve this? Is my own existence fault enough?

We were parked outside the park where I spent some nights listening to music with Monica. Now it wasn't my car. Now I wasn't a boyfriend. Now I could feel, now I let myself experience the emotions, now I was alive.

Maybe a part of me still blames me for it. Was life really easier when I was dead, when I was a walking corpse?

I fought with the idea of calling or not. I wanted to, every little part of my body screamed like the patients waiting for their turn in the karaoke. My brain, my mind was the young intern who couldn't deal with it. Who was so engrossed in her own problems that everything was impossible. I wanted to scream. I was both the patients and the intern. I wanted to scream at me and scream back. I wanted to grab me by the throat and made me do something. I wanted to fight back.

Every moment was an internal fight. Every hit hurt me.

I did call. The secretary answered. Yes, there he works. The consultation is 800 pesos. I would make an appointment as a first time. It would be until late march.

I knew it. It was done. I could make it then. I didn't. I passed again. I can still call tomorrow. I can check it with Rene, ask for his opinion. I can still call tomorrow. Why do I still hurt? Why didn't the pain go away? What more do I want from me?

 We went and Paola was alone with her baby. Chevo and Jessica were the next to arrive. They had this private joke about a pregnancy test. We were isolated again. We were left apart. Catherine felt what I feel all the time.

I always envied people who had their families here with them. I felt my own were in Mexicali. If I were there I wouldn't be alone. In reality, when I am there, I am still alone. They have their friends there. Wherever I am, I don't belong.

Is it my fault? Is it something I did? The last time we saw them was in the premiere. No, that was the last planned time. The last was an accidental one.

Am I mad at them or at me?

I feel lonely. I feel helpless. I need help. Do I have anyone to ask it?

Did I make this to myself? Is this really my fault?

What did I do wrong? Where did I fail? When?

What can I do? I can't take this anymore.

## 2016-01-07

"You are a very special person. You have the ability to smile despite all the difficult things that have happened"

Two years ago I was supposed to be a man. I think about that young and confused person who couldn't recognize himself in the mirror. He who would stand in front of his reflection and look at it curious, studying it, sweeping every little detail and comparing it with who he was supposed to be. He didn't recognized himself and now I do.

I should had been a man two years ago. I wasn't and I still am not. I still have a penis and testicles, my back is as broad, my voice is as deep, my hands and feet as big, I am as strong. But I am not one. I am not empty either. I know who I am. I am not a lie because there is no truth.

My legs are shaven. My stomach and chest are too. My hair is even longer. In my drawer I have almost as much woman's underwear as man's. I have a couple pair of bras and tights. I have a dress and a skirt in my closet. I have a couple of woman's jeans and leggings. I have that pencil bag from jr high filled with make up. I've worn them all outside my house, in public, and be seen as who I feel am.

I used to try to find me in my dreams. I can't remember the last one where I even paid attention to the gender I were. I have stopped looking for myself.

I am not a man and I am not a woman. I am sure of being a person. I am something else, too. I am unique, I am me. I have Catherine and Anahi. I am not as alone as I thought.

I have started my adult life and stopped being the man I was never meant to be.

...

I woke up again in the early morning. An hour past midnight and I couldn't sleep again. I saw the messages from Consuela and Alberto. They made me smile and yet I didn't open them. I kept trying to sleep in spite of me knowing it was all for naught. I sent Catherine a message telling her that I woke up and I'd hate to stay awake again. I plucked my eye brows, I walked in the living room and returned to my bed. I tossed, turned, uncovered and covered myself over and over again.

I may had fallen asleep a couple of minutes just before the alarm started. After my dad left home I went for a towel and got ready. Nobody was awake. I was supposed to wear jeans. I would go with my parents and be with them in the afternoon. I put legging instead. I didn't care. I did it anyway. Did I want to be noticed and asked?

Catherine came for me and took a picture when I got in the car. I saw the pictures. When I looked at myself in that little screen I liked what I saw.

I feel so different to two years ago. It was one of the best and worst birthdays ever. It started awfully with a fight and tears and Catherine gave me a beautiful journal with a lot of happy memories in its pages, and in which I would later fill its blank ones with my fears, worries and sadness.

I was confused and sad and scared. I was afraid and hateful and angry. Now I am still scared but I have stopped being confused.

Last year I tried to cover everything and pretend nothing happened.

Today I went to break fast in a restaurant where Catherine always wanted to go. We were welcomed in darkness by an unheard welcome. I didn't hear the gender we were referred with. I did not ask. I didn't want to ruin how I was feeling, spoil the image I saw in that little screen. The waiter saw us and referred to us as two women.

The lights returned and we payed. We parked outside our high school and talked about yesterday. I cried strongly after drinking the beer. I lied in bed and sobbed without a care of being listened.

I saw rene and he welcomed me. He did not mention how I was dressed. I did.

We went to the hotel. It was really nice.

I called to the clinic. I asked Rene, no, I confessed to him my fear of waiting and being told that I would not be treated. I could always go and ask in person or grab a little presentation card. I ate my fear and called after being naked and warmed in Catherine's embrace.

Nobody answered and we returned to bed. Before leaving I tried again.

"I called yesterday to make an appointment with Dr Magallanes. I would like to make it"

"Now he's not free until April"

Sure, whatever, it was fine. What was a couple of weeks later? I reminded her it was my first time. I told her my name. My official name. She asked me for the rest so I gave the first, too.

Was I referred by someone? No. Why did I not tell her the name of Rene? He did not refer me there. Maybe I could had said it. Maybe I shouldn't had. It never occurred to me to ask him.

"What is the motive?" I expected that question and answered it as calmly as anyone could. It was like if I had said I had a typical flu. I could bet she would never guess how I've been dreading even to call or tell it to anyone else. Even I was surprised when I realized how the act of saying it out loud scared the shit out of me.

"Hormone Replacement Therapy"

She hesitated and asked me to wait a little. I heard her coughing away from the phone. She returned and told me awkwardly.

"uhm, when someone with, uh... this situation... comes, the doctor asks them to be seen before by a psychiatrist..."

I cut her midsentence and confirmed. "Yes, so I need a letter from my therapist?" "Yes"

She gave me the date and I even forgot to ask the location of the clinic.

Now I am almost sure it's in the Prado Clinic. My fear was evaporated. He sees patients with "my kind of situation". He has a protocol. He won't doubt me or judge me. I just need a letter from Rene. Will he give it to me? Will he?

"I am terrified of asking for help and being denied" Would he be the one to tell me "Sorry, but no"?

What if he's not enough? What if I'm denied because he's not a psychiatrist? He did prescribed me antidepressants. He is a medical doctor. What if that's not enough? What if I am not trans enough?

Do I doubt of convincing him or convincing myself?

"My name is Ivan, and I'm so macho"

Jessica and Monica wished me a Happy Birthday. "Thank you, I hope we see each other soon" "Thank you, Monica, wish your dad a happy birthday from me, too".

I waited for that moment for a lot, and when it actually came I didn't know what to do... What would I answer back? I had thought for a time to saying something cold and succinct like a "thx". I had thought about staying silent. Then, something cold but just, "you didn't have to do this for a compromise"... that wouldn't be just, that would be full of resentment. Thankfully I did nothing of those things.

"Yeah, tomorrow because I'm already in my bedroom", she answered back. Whatever. "Sure", I said instead.

I saw the pictures of my birthday. There are a lot of us and a lot of me alone, too. I'm supposed to hate pictures. Not seeing myself, reminding me of how I look, how far apart I am of a pleasant image of who I feel as. I see them and I look happy. I have a wide smile which shows most of my teeth. It's like if I was looking for things to hate, to feel bad about. My clothes were fine, my face was ok, my hair, too. My teeth... those weren't as white as they should. Sure I could whine about them.

I saw the video and found what I was looking for. My voice. I have certain coarse movements but they're almost imperceptible, some signs in my face but they're minuscule. But my voice, that one is obvious and enormous. It's not really that low, but there is something there. It's like I'm hiding something but the bulge can be seen covered. It hears like the bulge under my legs looks.

I remember the gestures I had to do to the waiter so I could hide it. I seem like a shy person, but do I look like a transvestite, too?

That's not what I am. I can't be a man wearing woman's clothes if I am not really a man. Can I say I am not a man if I haven't started with the hormones and the changes?

When I'm asleep my body looks exactly like the one from a man and there are no consciousness where to place the dysphoric feelings and thoughts.

Would anybody be wrong in saying my corpse is a man's one when I die?

I almost forget to take my pill today. I got distracted by the anxiety and thrill of having the appointment.

I should be looking for jobs, I should be getting ready my papers for the process of getting my certification. I can't do anything about the appointment until I see Rene next week and tell him about what I was told. Saying to him that I made the appointment, that is set and that I'll need an evaluation.

I read the post of a Human rights lawyer where he talked about how important it was the Supreme Court of Justice in the social advances there were in our country in the matter of LGBT nature. He was a lawyer who studied in the National Autonomous University and in Essex, a university in the UK. I remember the Across the pond organization. I could send them a mail and ask them for help with the application to their universities.

Doing what I was so afraid of gave me a new perspective of the difficulty of things.

I am still scared of asking for a job. There are so many things which I'm nervous about. Applying for a job, applying for a master, applying for a scholarship, the results of the test, the meeting with the doctor. All of them has to do with how I do, their judgements and evaluations.

I am scared of being seen. That's what I want but am afraid of.

I don't know how the doctor looks, the way he talks, his age. What does it matter? I could hate the guy, but if he can give me what I want I'll keep meeting him. I don't want a friend, I want a doctor.

No, I need a doctor, and I do want a friend. I wanted to talk about it. Tell it to someone, anyone. Catherine was with me. Rene I wouldn't see until next week. There was Anahi, and the list was done.

What about telling Anahi scared me?

I did tell her but I acted excited instead of scared. She told me she was glad and congratulated me in a way.

Do I want somebody to be scared and nervous? My parents would be. Do I want to tell them? I do.

What am I waiting for? What am I scared of?

Which would be easier? Telling I am trans or telling I will do something about it?

## 2016-01-09

I look around and see all the things in the wrong places. Several times I've tried to gain the motivation to actually clean up my room. I have counted the number of places where I need to order everything. The little box in the bookcase, the one where I have the prescription and money. The upper side I use as a shelf. The shelf over it. The three on the wall from the other side. My desk.

I wanted to go the US. I had a package there since almost a month. The gift for Catherine and Luis were there. My little cases for the contact lenses. Now I don't have an excuse to not wear them. I can try them again. Who were the one that asked? "Was it hard getting used to them?"

My mother. Yeah, she asked Ivana, the psychologist niece of my aunt. She's working in an office. I could work in a place like that. Human Resources. The Mexican in my class in Salamanca works in an office, too. I could find something somewhere.

Yesterday I passed the pictures to Catherine. She really really liked them. She liked how she looked and how I looked. She sent me back the one where I am holding her gift, the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind DVD and smile at the camera. "You look so girly here"

Did she mean girl as in a child or as in a woman. "Both". I looked small and feminine. My small, my clothes, my hair. She really really likes me. I used some of those pictures as display pictures in several social networks. Twitter I put one clear where I smile in Rene's building. A close up of my face outside the elevator.

Even in Facebook where I still have that other name I put one of those. I am drinking coffee so the cup covers my red lips. The off-focus of the shot hides the softness of my face and my glasses blurs even more the color of my eyelashes. I look "normal" I am an essence there. Maybe for unknown people I might look like a woman, but people who do know me can recognize me.

Maybe it's like my uncle's wedding rehearsal, when my mother introduced me to that relative of my father, he was looking for an Ivan in my brothers. "Oh, you? I thought you were a woman".

I remember his remark in the actual wedding when he was looking for me again. Was it you? he again asked Miguel. "He had his hair over his face", mocked with a gesture of his hands on his cheeks. Did I care? I guess If I hadn't, I wouldn't be mentioning it now.

I was so terrified of even wearing a bra outside of the hotel room. Now I wear women's pants in my own birthday. I get out of my house with my face colored. As if I wanted to be seen. I want them to notice, to ask, to be interested.

They are interested, I want to tell them. Maybe we both are trapped in a continuous game of evitation.

I have to tell them. No, I don't. Do I?

It will be harder saying I am trans and just about to start treatment than saying I am depressed and confused about my gender. It will be even worse to tell my dad I am trans and already taking hormones to change my body.

Will it be like if I'd tell him I'm taking a slow poison? I'm slowly killing the son he thought he had. The potential person he had created in his own mind.

I'm a killer, a murderer. I will kill a brother and a son. I have murdered mercilessly a friend, a best friend. I didn't think twice before killing a lover.

I remember one night of drinking where I told Catherine how I really felt. I was really drunk and took advantage of the desinhibition caused by the alcohol. I told her how I, Sofia, that feminine germ which was hidden and forgotten inside that young and sad boy, was actually what saved his life. I gave him the energy to move on. I gave him the hope of life, the motivation of a dream and a goal. I was the spark of life that kept him moving, that forbade him of giving up and stepping off.

Would he, me, had really killed himself if it weren't for this realization?

Or was the realization of me the one that killed that mask?

Am I a savior or a executioner?

## 2016-01-10

"Ivan, you are Sofia, right?"

He didn't say those words today. Yesterday was when we caught the second half of Vanilla Sky in the television. I put it on.

I am in Salamanca, Spain. I love walking through these streets. It feels haunting when you turn around and can't even fathom the ages of the buildings by your side. I am not alone. Maybe we're walking to the cinema. Raul and Consuela are by my side. We just passed the avenue of our house. We crossed the way to the park. Raul talks about thinking of a spanish movie he can show his friend. I say I don't know many, but I like "Abre los ojos". "Yeah, everything but Almodobar"

We went several times to the theater. Her, a belgian movie, we even watched a spanish one. 7 vasque last names. There was a french one. Les garÃ§ons et Guillaume, Ã  la table!. I didn't what was about. It was the story of Guillaume. He was one of many brothers in his family with a peculiar relationship with his mother. The actor played both the part of Guillaume and the mother. The character himself overidentified with that persona. He was a feminine men. He went to Spain, Sevilla. There, his abroad family introduced him to the flamenco dance. They taught him, by mistake, the role of the woman. It was a comedy where the punchline of every joke was his feminine role. I can't remember if that was one of the firsts or lasts. It could explain my own repression.

I remember writing about it. I remember feeling sick. I hated every scene. I hated the character and his portrayal. I hated the conclusion where he was just confused and his first relation with a woman cured him of his feminine personality. He was a "normal" man with a normal voice.

Raul laughed. Was Consuela there? Did I cry or was I angry? Maybe I just stayed silent. I remember not laughing.

Another movie we watched was Dallas buyer's club. There I could see Jared Leto played the role of a transgender woman. I don't remember any comments about that one. I don't remember identifying with that character. Was it gone already?

I saw it later, I was here already, and I didn't either.

Tomorrow Catherine will call the DMV to ask if the printer is ready. If it is she'll pick me up and after her therapy, we'll pick them up. Maybe we can go downtown and buy charcoals for our little hookah. The tobacco will expire soon. The day after tomorrow I will go to her house. We will await the results of our tests and use that as an excuse to see each other. We might see the movie she gave me on my birthday. We might smoke a little or drink one of the holiday beers I still have.

Am I nervous? I won't graduate with the GPA I thought I would have. I made a mistake when I took the average. Maybe I left out one of the classes when I divided by the total. It turns out I'll have a 94 instead of a 98. It is still a really good one. I might be the third or even the second place out of the whole class. There was this fantasy of me being Magna Cum Laude. How ironic it would be being the best of my class from a career I'm not sure of pursuing.

Summa Cum Laude is almost as good. Hilda might had lowered her own GPA, too. I would not give the speech anyway. I would not have the words anyway. Almost all of my problems right now consist in things I have to say but can't.

Another fantasy I have consists precisely in those results. Being high enough. Having one of the bests. Being mentioned while I walk there. Being given a medal, invited to go to the DF to receive my price. Going to the DF. I might start hormones this first semester of the year. Why do I still want to go there? I am scared of starting now, asking for a letter, asking for them. I am scared. How can I fear waiting even more?

Yeah, DF is where I can still change my name. It's the second step, the next goal. There is the master I want to attend. The city. The capital. There is far enough to escape this life.

The next day, Wednesday is when we will see Chevica. Catherine will talk to them. Do I prefer not saying anything because I don't see a point or because I am, too, scared of talking to them?

The day after that I have to tell Rene about my appointment. Ask him about his approval.

I am scared of his reaction just like I am scared of my dad's.

"Thank you, my beautiful girl"

Today Catherine picked me up. We were going to pick up the licenses. She would go first to her therapy. We agreed to meet a little past noon. I had more than enough time to get ready and wait for her. My cell phone marked a little past 8 in the morning when I first woke up.

I dreamed with Monica. I told Catherine when we were sitting waiting for our food next to the frikiplaza. "Have you had any sex dreams?" I had asked her in our way downtown.

I first dreamed I was in a hotel room. I had invited Monica to come over and time passed before I began to think she would never arrive. We were going to watch a movie. She did come. I was relieved that everyone was asleep. Nobody had to know. I guess I felt guilty already. She didn't share my relief or fear of being noticed and the first thing she did was say hello to my parents.

When we were alone in my room, I tried to turn on the television but noticed that it didn't work. There was some kind of static or visual noise that interrupted whatever was on. The plans were ruined. We couldn't do what we were supposed to. Was I or she the one who proposed anything else?

I just remember the kiss and the guilt. I thought about her boyfriend but not my girlfriend. Why did we kiss? Were we going to do anything else? I saw her bare breast. What happened?

I remember scenes or isolated images from another dream. Sand. I remember footprints left in the sand. I remember the noise of the sea waves. I woke up inside my dream outside a local which sold alcohol. No. There was something before. We were lying on the sand. Somebody was by my side. Was she or was Catherine? I remember her, her voice. She talked sweetly to me. She proposed me, no flirted with me. She teased me about modelling something for her. It couldn't be. I remember about myself. About us. She couldn't deal with it. She can't, she doesn't. That couldn't be real. That wasn't happening. Maybe then I woke up outside that place. I was hungover and asked for a beverage. It was like the liters we use to drink. I remembered and corrected the order "without alcohol". They laughed at me. I didn't care. I couldn't give the first sip when I really woke up.

Funnily enough Catherine remembered me parked in my neighborhood. She masturbated, no, she got turned on with the memory of me being on top of her from the first time we went to the motel. The image of my legs surrounding her, covered in tights, the feeling of the skirt covering both of our bodies, all those sensations lasted her, easy, for two weeks.

Moments before that, she freaked out. She accelerated and had to park. I put the brake and hugged her. It was the idea of me stopping the relationship with Chevo and Jessica. Me really being alone. Having nobody else but her.

She had told me before how she felt awful thinking about her loneliness and how it must be for me, who has even less acquaintances than her. Maybe that was it. Maybe was that plus the burden of the expectations I put her being the only one who can support me.

I'd lie if I write her that I felt nothing while I hugged her. That it didn't hurt me. That I was as calm as I could be and I cheered her up because I am used to the idea of being alone.

I was scared. That's the feeling I battle most of the time. I'm scared of being left alone. I'm scared of being too much for anyone. I'm terrified of keep counting the people, my loved ones, whose life was easier the moment they left me.

I thought about reaching out to Melissa, to Hilda. I plan on telling Paola about me. Using her as practice before I tell my dad.

"I was at almost nothing from standing up and going to my father's room to actually tell him about me", at first I thought I was exaggerating when I wrote that to her. Then I felt nervousness when I realized it was true. I did think it. I did considered it and review the words in my head.

I bought a gift for Luis. I bought a 2x2 rubik cube. I have it with the cube I bought for him before.

I'll give him both. I got angry with his remarks about my own gift, but I love him. I will tell him sooner rather than later.

I already wrapped Catherine's gift. I filled a notebook sheet with our names and little messages. Then I wrapped the timeturner inside it. I used the wrapper from her gift to me two years before, and that I put inside a little box which I taped with the tape of the INE.

It is a nice gift.

I love her. She's the person that I fear the most about losing.

I wouldn't be here without her help. I can't even imagine where I'd be without her.

Esta vez no es SofÃ­a quien escribe las palabras, soy yo, Catherine, su novia. Es tentador revisar dias anteriores, no sÃ© porque si ya he leido fragmentos de su diario, dias en especifico que ella me deja ver. Me dijo podia hacer trampa, o dejarle un mensaje. Me parecio buena idea, pero ahora no se que escribirle.
Hace casi un aÃ±o que empece a hablar contigo Sofi, veo hacia atras y parecen aÃ±os, es tan largo y tan corto al mismo tiempo. Hace un aÃ±o ni siquiera imaginaba que mi vida seria asi. Que me llamaria tu novia, que te diria a ti mi novia, que hubiese tanta confianza entre nosotras como para caminar desnuda delante de ti, para que vieras mi relacion con muÃ±eca, para que me vieras estallar como lo hice ayer en mi carro. Me encanta estar a tu lado, no encientro otra palabra, simplemente me encanta, disfruto tu compaÃ±ia, me encanta cada aspecto de nuestra relaciÃ³n, me gusta hablar de temas complicados, temas que nos sobrepasan como todos los que estamos viviendo en este momento. Me gusta hablar de nada y solo abrazarte, sentirte cerca. Me gusta tontear, tener nuestras curas. Me gusta que me sigues la corriente y a veces me toca a mi seguirte la corriente, me gusta cuando me sorprendes como hoy en el caminito de CECUT. Te quiero tanto, a veces no se que responder cuando me preguntas por que te quiero. Quisiera abrirte mi cabeza y vieras lo que pasa ahi dentro cuando te veo, cuando me tocas, me besas, cuando puedo oler tu cabello, al sentir que tu mano busca la mia y entrelazamos los dedos.
Tengo miedo de perderte, de lo cambios que podrian pasar, de trabajar y tener menos tiempo para ti. Para nosotras. Tengo miedo de la reacciÃ³n de mi padre cuando sepa de nosotras, son personas tan importantes para mi, tu y el, no soporto la idea de lastimarlos.
Solo quiero desaparecer contigo, irnons lejos, solo y yo, abrazarte y no dejarte ir nunca.
Aun siento cosquillitas en el estomago cuando te beso, cuando agarras mi cara. Aun recuerdo nuestra primera noche juntas, el como nos abrazamos para dormir, mi temor de que no se repitiera, de que a ti no te hubiera gustado tanto como a mi. Esa primera noche temia que nos soltaramos, que en algun momento de la noche dejaramos de tocarnos, que te dieras la vuelta y en la misma cama hubiera distancia entre nosotras. Eso no paso, nuestros cuerpos nunca dejaron de tocarse.
Me encanta dormir contigo, aunque hemos pasado noches donde ya no dormimos abrazadas, se siente bien, ya no tengo el temor de sentirte lejos en la misma cama, se que estas conmigo.
Me has apoyado enormemente Sofia, me tienes paciencia, simplemente estas ahi para mi. Asi como has estado para mi, quiero estar para ti, me esfuerzo por darte lo mejor de mi, porque lo mereces, te lo mereces Sofi, te lo he dicho anteriormente estoy orgullosa de ti, de ti como persona, por tus cambios, por tus logros academicos, personales, por todo. Eres inteligente, cariÃ±osa, fuerte, aunque no lo veas en ti, se que lo eres, y se que puedes con todo lo que se viene para ti, aunque ahora lo veas demasiado, se que puedes.
Me gusta pensar en un futuro contigo, en casarnos, en vivir juntas, pensar en viajar, alguna vez hablamos de tener una casa, de cuantos y como serian los cuartos que tendria. Hablamos de paises, y en verdad todo me da emocion, todo lo quiero contigo.
Me gustas, me gustas mucho, me gusta tu cabello, esos chinos me vuelven un poquito loca, me gusta ver cuando te baÃ±as por como se te ve el cabello mojado, ver que tan largo es realmente. Me gustan tus ojos con y sin lentes, tu mirada es tierna y dulce, expresiva, puedo ver cuando estas triste o enojada, y he podido ver las veces que estas feliz. Me gusta tu sonrisa, realmente la considero bella. Me encantan tus labios, el grosor y la textura que tienen, me encanta besarlos, probarlos con mi lengua. Me gusta tu cuerpo, aunque se te haga dificil de creer, me gustan tus pechos, son pequeÃ±os y suaves, me gustan tus pezones. Y creo que no seguire porque luego me caliento.
Hace dias pensÃ© preguntarte, como sabes cuando amas a una persona, que se siente, que es diferente entre querer y amar, porque jamas me habia sentido asi con alguien, jamas habia sentido, pensado, deseado asi a alguien.
Te quiero, te adoro Sofia.

"I'm angry, no, upset..., angry, I don't know. I guess I am something with you. Because I can't pinpoint it, but no matter what, since lately, I don't feel like I flow with you two"

We talked. I decided to dress in a masculine way and I ended up wearing a bra and make up. I looked manly, though? No. I looked feminine but I did look like a boy. It doesn't matter. The meeting was planned to be at 3 o'clock. We didn't touched the point until later in the afternoon.

Today Catherine picked me up and took me to school to ask for the papers need for the license. From there we went to eat. We ate a soaked sandwich and a taco. Like the one we tasted in Guadalajara.

Yesterday I didn't do my own words. She gave me a hand there. She typed a little message from her own computer. Meanwhile, I was sitting in the jetta with my dad. We were parked next to the road with a flat tire. I was wearing the leggings and still have a little bit of paint on my face. Did my father notice? Did he stay silent on purpose. I considered seriously the idea of blurting it out. Letting it out and just dealing with the consequences later. Stop wondering how freezing is the water and just take the jump. I didn't. We finished the trip to the tires place and just waited there.

Why was I in need of a new tire?

Two nights ago, we were waiting for the results of the Last Test. We had planned to me going to Catherine's house and there look at the results. I was already in bed. We both were. Claudia was the one who posted that the results were already public. I could had just looked them up right then and there. I waited for Catherine to look for her pass and her folio number.

While she was away looking and got lost inside my own tablet. Why was it that I arrived to that thought? What exactly made me think of the master? I looked for the postulation of the master this year. It started a couple of months before. It will end in two weeks. I have two weeks to make the decision.

I remember now. I wanted to see the dates. I was thinking in the results of the test and how the one with the highest points gets a medal in the capital. They pay that person a round trip to pick it up. What if it conflicts with my other appointment? What if the dates of the tests and interviews of the master conflicts, too? That was what I wanted to know. I, instead, learned that I had just little more than ten days to make a decision.

I was so perplexed by it that I didn't care about the results anymore. I saw them and couldn't understand completely what they said. I got the highest marks. I was happy and excited. I then, stopped caring. Just like the child my mother described when remember our past, that little kid who lost the excitement of that new toy faster than he could smile.

Those results won't give me a job. My grades won't give me the rights to a future.

I went to Catherine's house anyway. I gave her the beers and the sleeping bag and her gift. I filled a little notebook paper with our names and little messages. I wrapped that in the wrapping page of my own present and then put it in a cylinder box which I taped shut with the tape from the elections.

I wore the leggings to her house. I was seen by her mother and father and uncle. I was seen by my own parents later in the night. I was seen but not really recognized. Her mother asked her today if I wasn't cold. I wore those pants like the kids wear them nowadays.

We went to the talk about stars in the CECUT about stars and then I returned her home. Twice was I mentioned as a man. They used the neutral masculine and I was upset by my own sad reaction. Why does it have to upset me? I look like a man. I know it. There's nothing I can do right now to change it. Why does it hurt? I already started and did everything I could.

No, I haven't. I still don't change my own voice.

What of it scares me?

I practiced it on my way home. I was hearing me, wondering how different would it be heard by other ears, when the car jumped as it passed that crater in the road.

When I got home and moved it again to park it in the pick up's place I noticed it and my dad did, too.

"Tell your Mom we will return soon"

I have two weeks to make a choice. I have two weeks to tell everybody in time.


## 2016-01-14

What is this that I'm feeling?

Did I dream something today? Did this sorrow accompanied me the whole day? When did it start?

I remember turning the alarm off. Catherine mentioned something about a dreams of hers and I tried to forgot mine. Yesterday I wrote a little fragment of the day's writing in twitter. I hate that page. I have a profile picture there. Why did I put it? Catherine told me I look god. Is it because of the picture that I don't like it? No. I feel alone. I feel I talk by myself. I receive mails of notification of being liked and re-tweeted. What am I expecting?

 Anahi posted the status of the death of Alan Rickman. I was going to therapy today. Yesterday I couldn't find my own log. I looked for it everywhere. I did find it.

Today I was going to dress masculine. I looked... I can't find the word. This is not normal, nor usual. This is... expected? by who?

"Me waiting for my boyfriend to notice my haircut"

Why did that post make me so angry? Was it the mention of her boyfriend? Was it the comment of her Dad or the likes? Was it that he deleted me, and my mother still have her? Is it that she still has me? That I kept her, too?

I told Rene about the university and the test and the call and everything. He gave me reasons why I could, why it was possible and I could do it. Maybe he really thought me capable. It wasn't until I told him that I see waiting as the most reasonable choice that he reminded me how he stated this was something that should not be rushed.

He hesitates and goes back and forth with the pronouns. I don't care. I don't mind.

The gas dispatcher fooled me. He welcomed me with a plural neutral greeting. I asked for the amount I wanted and waited. "served" he said in the feminine form.

"Was he mistaken? He was referring to the gasoline."

This time I was right.

"Yeah, they sometimes take them to someplace, too, to receive something when they get those results".

I got the email in the afternoon. The day I'm supposed to take the test in the capital is when I'll be given the diploma. They won't give it to anybody else. Like if I cared.

I won't do the test anyway. I won't apply for the master. I'll apply next year.

Catherine will do her trip. She would be gone and not be able to come with me. That's the last city we haven't gone to.

She had planned several times to change her schedule. She wants to return sooner. It's the best. Her birthday she will spend it alone. She has meetings and interviews of job she has all the procedures and paperwork for the certifications and license. Going in a trip this time of year is foolish thing to do. They didn't took account of her.

I feel irritated still. I am angry. Is it with Monica or Catherine's mom?

It's not sorrow I've been feeling. It's ire.

Rene told me he could help me in any regard, maybe they said a psychiatrist as an umbrella term. I should confirm anyway. They might have a doctor which deals with us "of my situation".

He has given me certain comments that I've noticed. "He might help you in that or another treatment". "Maybe he's a specialist who can treat you in a different manner."

Is he trying to get rid of me? Will he back out?

I'm doing it again. I can almost see the paranoia in this words. I look for obstacles outside, because they're easier to deal with than to accept that I'm scared.

I called when I got home. I called and the line was busy. I waited and my hands trembled. I called again and I got an answer.

There was a lady but it was not the same one. I reminded her of my appointment, the doctor and the treatment. I asked about the referral which is needed.

She asked me to wait and got up. A new voice came. It was calmer, nicer. She confirmed that I need an evaluation but there is no dr, I can choose whomever I want. I asked if my usual therapist, whose not a psychiatrist but a psychologist and a medical doctor could do and she said yes. I asked about the place and she confirmed it.

I said good bye and we hung up.


I feel the urge to get up and tell my dad. Talk with him. Why is it rage that I feel instead of fear?

Will it be easier to talk about if I'm angry instead of scared?

Would it be easier to scream it than confess it in tears?

"I have sad eyes, expressive ones. My eyes tattle me, they betray me. Will I get to the point to want to take them out?"

Why did I started again to pass the journal? I could just empty and clean the logs in an electronic file. It would be cleaner and more organized. What point is there to write it in sheets of paper with my own hand and ink?

I remember how I passed the other ones. I would read the conversations with Monica, the fights, the arguments. I'd feel the feelings all over again. Like if writing them down it would be like getting the pin inside the bottle of ink and filling it up. Except there is no pen and there is no bottle of ink, I touch those memories and emotions and the sadness and misery crawl from the pages through my fingers all the way to me.

Is this the same way? I've just passed two or three days.

I just returned from Portugal. Consuela stands in my door-frame nervous and with something to confess. I think if she has feelings for me and that would made me feel double stupid. I am a slob who doesn't do his chores. I start showing the first symptoms. I'm filled of guilt and turn off all the lights. I start to drink. The irritability shows with Catherine. I finish bottles of wine and ask for entire litters for myself.

I woke up late today. I ate a lot. No, I did not. I ate normally. Why does it feel that way? I heated some soup and fried two eggs. Late in the afternoon my mother brought me a sandwich. That's it.

Why am I nervous? It's the weekend. I should rest or do something. I should do laundry or get out. It's the half of the month. I have a trip to pick up my award next month.

I should look for jobs, send my resume and go to interviews. Why am I scared?

I made my choice. I'll stay.

I woke up and sent a birthday message to Hilda. Did I dream something or the thought of telling her just spontaneously appeared on my mind? I should be thinking about telling my parents, not other people.

I had thought about sending her the pictures in which she appears. I thought about opening up to Melissa, too. She might be working with Ahmed now. Almost everyone I can think of has a job now. Do I feel pressure? Is that what this feeling is?

"Why do you need to find a job?" Catherine's mom asked her.

Why do I? It's what I am supposed to do. It's what I need to do.

I have to dress formally to the trip to Tecate. Even that is something to which I need to disguise myself.

Rene told me I might need to go to a psychiatrist for my evaluation. I am fulfilling all the requirements. To him I could had done the appointment in Sofia's name. Wear a dress and used that feminine voice in the phone. Maybe I could just present myself that way to him or her secretary. Going to the first interview and telling him why I go there. Would I treat it as some kind of test? See if anybody notices?

No, I'd be asked my motive of consultation. I would need to state that I'm going for an evaluation to go to an endocrinologist.

I don't need to. I can ask Rene for his letter. He said it nonchalantly in the middle of different ideas. He could help me with that. He could do it.

I can't fear that he won't now. What do I fear now? To what can I get nervous?

The place where I sent my resume answered that they would arrange the interviews this next week. I haven't sent to any other place.

I have to take the pictures and get the papers ready. Luis will have his birthday in two weeks. I have his presents. Catherine will leave in those days around. I have hers, too.

Then, when she returns I can go to Tecate to pick that useless award.

I fantasize about selling myself, being this proud and confident man who gains their attention in the interview. I'm none of those things.

Where else can I send a resume?

What am I expecting, waiting?

Is these emotions the result of the tangled words I keep hidden inside? Will they vanish when I tell my dad?

I won't have to see him until nights, I can hide in my room.

Maybe I won't be ever able to see him again.

I'll take his son away.

He is already dead. I'm just in his place, living his life.

And again I write the same nonsense all over again, as if romanticizing my cowardliness makes it better.



## 2016-01-16

"Mum, is it hard to take lipstick off?"
"If you tell me you're asking me because you're going to put it on, I'll slap you across the face"

Luis woke me up when he couldn't ignite the stove in the morning. At first I thought he was Miguel making himself breakfast. I didn't get up. I stayed there, lying, exhausted, dead.

A couple hours later somebody entered my room. I heard the sound of the door opening and it was like if I could had heard the light enter with him and extend its arm too to shake me from the covers. "Are you going to go to the United States?" One of them asked.

I doubted. I really considered it, let the idea move inside my mind like a sip of wine to grasp its true flavor before swallowing it.

"No, I think I won't." I turned and closed my eyes again. My mother had said if they were going they should be leaving the house around 8 in the morning.

I woke up again later. I wondered about getting up. Yesterday I rose after noon. It was more than a hundred minutes after midday.

"Did you sleep late yesterday?" my father would ask me later in Target. "Honestly, I can't remember".

I shake the weightiness and took my pill. I exited and saw "my mother's men" in the living room. They were waiting. No. Miguel wasn't there. I asked my father if they would not go. Yes, my mother was getting ready. I returned and grabbed the first items of clothes I saw in my closet. I moved some of the underwear closer to the drawer and picked one from the back. I climbed the stairs and say my mother brushing her hair.

"Aren't there any towels left?" "If you can't see any in there, no... That one is clean-ish"

I got in the bathroom with the damp towel and saw my own reflection. My long, curly and messy hair, the black strings growing from my face, my eyes heavy and full of something. I passed my fingers through the wires in my neck and grabbed the shaving machine. I was in a hurry but I had to do it. Shaving was not an option, but I wouldn't leave the house like this. I showered in less than 5 minutes. I could hear their voices in my head. My mother asking my father if I'd go. Why did I said no earlier, why until now.

I put my clothes on and tamed my hair. I wasn't even going to brush my teeth. I did and Miguel and Luis did also after seeing me.

What happened?

When did I start feeling bad? I took the pill. Before leaving I decided to start with the double dosage. I counted the pills and measured the days they'd last. No, I counted until this tuesday. I have to buy more. I have the money. Will I pay them myself or will I ask my father?

It's a way of opening the theme. "Dad, I need to buy more antidepressants." Would I leave it there? Am I trying to just wait for his answer? Stay passive expecting him to follow up? "Are you still going to take them? Do you know until when?" Or will I take the initiative for once? "I didn't tell you why I'm really taking them, right? ...right. I am nervous about my future. Getting a job, a career. And it's not just that. I don't like my body. I don't like being a man. It literally hurts me looking like this. Being seen like this. Dad, I am trans."

Why do I feel to urge to type "I am sorry?" Why should I be sorry? It's not my fault. It's not my choice or something that happened because I messed up. It's not a consequence or a misshapen. Would I apologize for being gay?

O can see it now, imagine it now. But I can't really see it.

I did talk about the master and the postulation. "There's no point in applying if you won't have your license."

"Ivan, did you grab some underwear?" "No" "Go and choose some boxers"

I don't wear boxers. I do need underwear but I won't buy it with you. I won't choose them with you nor make you pay for them.

It's not my mother whom I want to tell.

Not even with Luis.

I change the information in my own contact in my phone. I saw the picture and felt pathetic. Am I getting used to being this person again?

I went to the optic. The optometrician didn't ask about contact lenses. My mother got in first. When it was my turn it was like routine. "Have you picked a frame you liked?" No. I did look this time. I had time, I wandered. I wasn't limited by their guidance "these are men's". I looked everywhere but none I liked. Even after, when it was the time to pick, I couldn't. I literally couldn't see myself in the reflection. Was it because of my sight or my mind?

I picked the most similar to these ones. Will they be okay? Will I be okay?

Why don't I feel okay?

What is it that I lack? What do I need?

Do I need their support or is it something to be nervous in which unload my anxiousness?

## 2016-01-17

"You are a woman" "So?"
"I've already seen that picture, you're with Catherine in front of a mirror looking at the camera and making a duckface"

Does he listen? Did he really see?

What happens in the mornings? What is it that keeps me down? I told Catherine about the feeling I identified. I looked at the picture. No. Chevo started following her in Twitter. He might notice the posts she makes, has made. He might see my own account and my picture. "Do I look fine in the profile picture?" I asked her once again. Yes, of course she thinks I do. She asked for that photo. Why does it make me uncomfortable. Why do I fear people will look at it and see it... how? Weird? Sick? Pathetic?

Because people know me, know Ivan. They will see Ivan with lipstick. They will see the person they have known all this time with his face painted up in a ridiculous smile and big shinny eyes. It doesn't fit.

Strangers see what I show them. Known people see what they are accustomed to.

Today I couldn't wake up. I did but it was so hard. I heard my dad and the rustling of the paper bags. I heard the door, his footsteps. I did get up, I did wake up and rise. I got up from bed and ate. But I returned. I came back and got inside again and covered myself and hide.

Was there a conversation? Why do I feel so alone today? I have talked with Catherine. She asked me, no, I asked her if we would go tomorrow to take our pictures. I'll have to wear a shirt and tie and a coat. I'll have to tie my hair and look masculine. Dress sharply, be normal. Look normal.

That's how I've been looking all this time. Maybe that's what is making me sick.

I am almost out of pills. I have to buy more. Yesterday I wrote I could tell my dad. I will need his money. There will be more than 300 pesos from the pictures. Then will be another 200 for the medication. I should separate the money I'll need for the dr. It's months from now. There is time.

Would I prefer it being tomorrow or in a year?

Am I scared? Why don't I know anymore how I feel?

Rene will be the one who'll make the evaluation. Am I feeling sick on purpose? Will I hide it from him so I can get what I want? ...what I need.

I'm not so bad. I showered today. I put apart my clothes to wash them. I shaved my torso and underarms and legs. I cut myself accidentally with the razor and remembered the burn on the smooth legs. It hurts and yet it feels so good. I look at them and see them almost the same. It's like I can't really find the difference. And yet, inside my head, how I feel, it's worlds apart, night and day, black and white.

I didn't shave my face. Maybe tomorrow. I will have to wake up early and be ready in the morning. I should pick the clothes now and print the paper with my grades and the notes from the Test. I should look for my birth certificate and school diploma.

"Ok, Jose, so they call you Ivan, right?"

No, they don't... No, actually yes, they do, most do. Homer was one of the first people to call me Jose. He is the last one who did when he congratulate me for my birthday. Carolina, too, was one of the people who preferred that name. I remember saying it together. Jose Ivan. Jose-Ivan, like a sopa opera. People liked it, several commented how they at first thought it was a single name. 'How do you prefer being called?' 'Which one you like best?'. Until high school I never cared. I thought it was because I liked both. I don't care. Call me Jose or Ivan, or Jose Ivan, or whatever. In high school I started getting interested in names. No, a couple of months before. Entering was when I got my firsts nicknames. Flash, cauliflower, cauliflash, little simba. I didn't hate them nor liked them. They were nicknames. They were like being called Ivan or Jose or whatever. I realized I didn't like my name, I just didn't care.
Then, the next semester came Chad. I actually was called chad and Corbin. I hated those, and with time, tolerated.
After that I came to appreciate being called Ivan. Now, most people called me that way. All but a handful of people. The ones who know me more. The ones who know. They use this other name that not even my parents know. Sometimes even my therapist messes them up. Sofia, Ivan, Sofia. He, she, him, her... I can't blame him, nor anyone. Even I needed months to get used to the idea. Even now I don't really know how I refer usually to myself. But yes, you can call me Ivan. You and everybody else

for now, I guess.

"Ivan, the technician will come at 10 or 11, can you wait for him?"

I am angry, I am sad. I am furious and tired. I'm heavy and hideous. I am pathetic and weak. I am depressed again.

I took the pill, I just have one left. I have no energy at all. I am irritable and down. I don't want to talk to anyone. I don't want to do anything. The washing machine is fixed and even thinking about standing up for my clothes is tiring. Last year I'd be checking over and over waiting for the clock to reach 0 and being the one to move it without anyone seeing it. I don't give a shit. I don't care if Luis or Miguel or my mom see the underwear between my sleeping clothes.

I just want to finish these words, change and go to sleep.


I was going to take the pictures and do the procedure for the certificate. I was supposed to wake up at 9 and start to get ready. My dad would call today. "I don't think they'll go that same day". He called the house and I didn't answer. He called directly to my phone and told me the news. Could I wait for the guy?

Last time I entered the shower and he came just as I was shaving. I had to be looking for the door. Open it up for him. Be attentive. I told Catherine and move the alarm an hour later. I moved but couldn't go back to sleep. I've been feeling off since then. I took the pill but it's been as if it got stuck in my fingers and I swallowed air.

Are these feeling something that can't be cured by the antidepressants? Are those the ones who have stopped working? Am I broken again?

I waited and time caught up. It was 11 and a half when I sent a text message to my dad. Would he really come? I was expecting to go to the university before lunch and today because tomorrow will be the auction for the classes.

He called me right back and asked me about it. I told him that. He might have noticed my voice. The one of it, the feeling under it. He said I should shower and get ready. If I left he would call him and tell him to come later in the evening. I should go.

I did. I got ready and my dad called me again when I was shaving. He'd come in 10 minutes. Could I wait that? I did and he came.

I was ready. He came and went. Less than 10 minutes. "Again? Last time it was the same thing, right? It's the second, and this happens very rarely, how curious" I raised my shoulders and he just smiled. He meant nothing behind that. Chit chat. His name was Ivan. Another time I would had introduced myself and maybe we might had a chat about the coincidence. Today I just extended my hand to meet his. I was not in the mood. I don't want to be Ivan anymore. I don't want to meet anybody nor say my name.

Even shorter than his stay here was the time I had to wait for Catherine to arrive. We drove to her session. I waited in the waiting room. The door was locked when we arrived. She followed our advice and changed the layout of her consult office.

She did take her pictures before coming my way. Midway there I realized I forgot my tie. I felt this huge feeling of... failure. It was as if I had forgotten my pants or my wallet. A terrible unfixable mistake. Nothing to be done. Deserving of punishment and shame. It was ridiculous.

I waited there. Catherine stepped in a couple of minutes after her meeting time. A quarter of an hour. We thought we heard the voice of Hilda but it wasn't. It was that same girl from the other time. She got her time back. Liliana gave it to her from the next session without realizing, I was there when her next patient arrived and sat besides me.

"You are from psychology, too, right?" I tried to smile but gave up halfway. "Yes" "Did you passed the Test?"
Sure, next month I'll go to a ceremony to receive a prize because of my results, not like it matters anyway. "Yes", I said instead, "and you?" I continued waiting for him to tell me he didn't, or he barely did, and then said something so I'd learn he has a job anyway. "Yes, they all should calm down and get over it".

He went back to his phone and I continued in my tablet. 10 minutes later Catherine stepped out.

Her therapist tires me. I felt seen. She knows me, knows my name and who I am. Would she see through me? Would she see this huge shadow over me, that dark passenger that drove me all day?

I took the pictures after returning for the tie. Catherine did the procedure in school. I'll do it tomorrow before refilling my prescription and going for the glasses.

I have to do it. I have to get up. This week they're supposed to schedule a meeting for an interview. I see the post about that other job. They're looking now for interns, students. I feel exhasperated. First because I was a student, now because I am not one.

It doesn't matter. I have enough to do and worry to think about a stupid job.

## 2016-01-19

I'm wearing new glasses. I picked them up today. My father gave me the money yesterday. I paid them and the pills. I didn't ask him for that money. Did I lose that chance? Can I ask him anyway? It's not about the money, it's the excuse. Why do I need an excuse?

I should feel less embarrassed, ashamed. Why do I still feel this way?

I woke up like almost all the other days. My body heavy and my eyes tired. I opened them and it was just an hour before noon. I was dreaming. We were in some kind of park. I was thinking about the rides. It was just like when we were in Disneyland. Luis was there, and the rest of the family, too. Were Anahi and Catherine there? I know there was some kind of lake. Luis jumped there I worried about him. I dived deeper and deeper and I think I screamed. I wanted someone to take him out, save him. He doesn't know how to swim. He'd drown. Why didn't anybody do something? My father jumped too and swam straight for the boat. Did my mother jump, too?

In another dream Irving was there. We were in some kind of room with a window facing a big building. There was some kind of university party. Drinks and food and music. He was over me, like when people do push ups and have someone over them as extra weight. Why would he be over me? I'm not strong, I don't exercise, why would I show him anything?

I was paralyzed when I opened my eyes for an instant. In a blink I was fine.

Even waking up late I had more morning than which I knew what to do with.

I showered after I picked my clothes. I didn't even shave. Neither my body nor my face. I didn't put anything on my face. I just cleaned my hair and untangled it. I didn't even tie it before mousse. I put the red shirt over my tank. My shoulders were bare when I looked at myself in the mirror. My hair is really long now. It gets to my shoulders. It's not a ball nor big knot. It's normal long hair. I sent a picture of Catherine and she made a note about my chest. She liked it. She saw it, like a chest, with shadow and a subtle round form. I just saw the black little dots of hair.

Even my face had a mask of shadow over my chin and neck. I didn't care. Nobody would see me, anyway.

I was ready and I chatted with Catherine until the time I'd be ready to leave. The offices in the university close between one and three for lunch. Ten minutes after three was the perfect time to leave. I'd be leaving my papers, then stopping in the pharmacy for some smiles in a bottle and finally picking up the glasses near my house.

I planned the whole day and journey for less time and gas wasted. I had my bag with a folder containing a plastic cover with the pictures and the documents I'd need. I had my book, too. I pretended to read it as I waited.

In the university I formed in line as I expected. I waited as I had thought I would. It was slower than yesterday. I was lonelier. I had my book. But I just read until I got to the window. After I gave her my papers and had to wait for them to give them back I just stood there. I couldn't read anymore. At first I did seat in one of those chairs. I went all the way to the back. Why do we people look for a seat when we don't have to be near another person?

I remember once when we went to the movies in Spain. I and Raul sat in two seats. There was an old man behind us who actually asked us to move. "The whole theater is empty, why would you sit in front of me?"

I didn't last more than 3 minutes in that chair. I couldn't hear anything. They'd call my name and I had to pay attention. I moved all the way to the front and stood there.

"Fernandez", the lady called. I went there and she saw me. "Jose Fernandez?" she confirmed. Does she do that with everybody? It'd be something normal to do in that situation. Do I want to doubt? Is this time like the one in the gas station where I looked for it?

I didn't look like a woman. I dressed and acted and talked like a man. I looked and played the part. In the pharmacy I didn't speak a word when the woman selling baked sweets approached me and called me sir.

I waited in there. It was lonely, deserted. I sat in an empty table surrounded by nobody and drank my water. I read another chapter. This is the shortest book that has taken me this long to finish.

I should finish it already and start with another one. I actually started it over again from the beginning. Did I caught up again in a loop where I don't pay attention because I don't understand what's going on and I can't understand because I don't pay attention?

I have my glasses and I see clearer.

Can I see things clearer, too? Can I have a more realist perception of my future and situation now? Or will I just get accustomed to this new perspective and things will start to get blurred again?

"You are a free and independent woman who is not anybody's property"

Today was an easier day. Yesterday I went to school. I exited the house. Maybe it's this house, this 4 walls who imprison me. Maybe it's being inside, hidden, covered. Yeah, that's what it is, staying inside out of everybody's sight. Ashamed. Why do I feel shame? What is it that embarrasses me?

Today my father asked me questions. We were alone in the living room. I was lying in the couch under a blanket and he was making himself dinner. I ate a sandwich in the afternoon and he was doing exactly that, too. He walk towards the end to the kitchen and asked me if I went out. The movement of my head answered him silently.

I just wrote how maybe being in this house is what maddens me, and yet, today that I feel alright is the day I didn't leave.

He asked again, in a different way. Will I do something tomorrow? I again moved my head but this time in another direction with a whole different meaning. "Where will you go?", "Therapy", I answered in one word. He stopped there. I stopped him. I could had gone on. I answered his first move with head movements and a one-word answer. I want to tell him the world and I can't even say a sentence.

There was something in the telly. Yeah, The Big Bang Theory. Sheldon was with Amy lying in the floor of a electronic department in a store. He was indecisive about buying an xbox or a play station.
My dad heard when the clerk of the store approached them to tell them the store had closed five minutes ago and the registers were closed, too.

He walked towards the tv with a huge smile on his face and started an anecdote with me as his only destination.

"When I was in the Netherlands, the [one day of the week, maybe thursdays but I really don't remember] they have this market outside where they sell all different kinds of things. So the stores and businesses from the city close around 2pm when they usually close at 6 or 7. A coworker was inside this music store browsing some discs. It was like one fifty-something. The owner of the store walked towards him and told him that he was going to close. "Yeah, I'm just looking", he answered back and kept what he was doing.

A couple minutes later the owner returned and grabbed him by the hand. "I'm closing now, thank you", he was saying as he escort him to the exit! He literally threw him out. "Back there they usually just close the door and wait until the ones inside leave. Here they literally close at 2pm" He finished and he was still smiling.

He returned to the kitchen and finished his sandwich.

What am I waiting for?

The more I wait, the more difficult it will be. The more I let time pass, the more things I have to tell, the more weight it will have.
The more time passes, though, the more liberating will it feel. The more relief my shoulders will have. When I told my mom I literally had excruciating back pain. Whenever I tell my dad will I be able to walk?


Tomorrow I'll see Catherine. "Will I go as a boy?" I asked her. When would I imagine that question would ever make sense in my life?

I don't know what will I wear. I have the two new shirts I bought the last time we went to San Ysidro. They are blue, a color I haven't used in a long time. A boyish color. And yet I plan to wear them with something feminine. I have this idea of dressing with something that I would not wear with my family around.

Do I do this because of Catherine? Is it for Rene? Maybe I want to dress like the last time, too. Look like a girl when I ask him to write a referral. Make it even harder for him to deny me, to tell me I'm not sure.

Why do I think of passive ways of telling people who I am?

Because I need to. I can't stand in front of the world, wearing man's clothes, looking like a man and tell them in a man's voice that I am not one.

It's as if I had to earned it. I have to fool everybody first. They have to be mistaken. Make them easier to accept I am one. Correct them in their own assumption.

"Is that person a woman?" "No, he is a man, he's called Ivan" "No, really?" "Actually no, I am not a boy, my name is Sofia" "See, it had to be".

Do I think about the world or myself when I make up that encounter? Maybe the real in-congruence lies between what I see and what I feel. That is whom I really want to convince?


## 2016-01-21

"I need my husband, can you get him?" "I can't." "I need to talk to my husband, and I need to hold my husband. Can you at least try?" "I'm sorry."

"Hello, girl, I'm from the school of Anthropology, would you help me buying a cookie?"
"Do you have a coin for something to eat, girls? Oh by the way, you both are really pretty."

"I get it, I can see it: I was a child and had it all repressed nicely and hidden. That's why I couldn't get in the girls' bathroom, even though I had my mother's permission and I knew nothing would happen to me, I couldn't because it was forbidden. It stayed that way until I reached puberty and it started to come out in my stories about a man killing a woman or a man meeting one and losing her forever. It wasn't until my teen years when it exploded and I couldn't deal with it anymore so I dived into a dark depressive episode.
Finally, it all resurfaced again in a moment of huge stress before leaving for another country. I can see it all, I know where it all came from and how it flourished. But how does that help me? I'm the same person I was when I didn't know"



I woke up earlier than I had thought I would. It was 6am precisely when I just opened my eyes. I escaped from a bad dream of a scene in an all-boys boarding school. A group of students were dressed in girls' uniforms and had wigs and make up. They were kissing each other when other group of boys turned on the lights and ran at them.

I got ready. I wore the leggings as Catherine proposed me. I liked the way the blue t shirt looked. I shaved my face and it looked fine. I applied make up and my face was normal. I liked it, I took a picture and sent it to Catherine. I got into my car. The neighbor from across the street saw me. He was washing his car when he looked up to catch me in his sight. I, like a little kid, pretended that if I didn't see him I'd turn invisible.

I parked my car in the parking lot next to my high school. I walked towards Rene's. I met a lot of sights. I saw people turned and inspect me. I noticed their eyes examining me. I saw the way the woman in the car turned to her copilot and laughed. I tried to hide in my own arms as I kept walking. I was lost in my own mind. I saw the green light and knew I could cross. When I gave my first step I heard his scream. I didn't even got to turn when he was already stopped. He apologized three times and I just mumbled a word in a borrowed voice. I kept walking. I entered the building as fast as I could. The mirrors tried to screamed my reflection at me but I ignored them.

Rene invited me in. I sat and didn't know how to start.

He saw me more flattened affectively. "I wonder if it is because of what you say of how you think you look or because of the steps you are taking towards a permanent change."

Both. It's the former and the latter, and that I can't find a job and that I haven't told my parents and that I feel lonely and a lot other things. It's everything.

He asked me a little about my clinical history. When did I start using the name of Sofia? That made me talk about my days in jr high when I looked for a name. Johann was the one I picked. Jayden was the one I hid and forgot.
"when you hear Jayden, do you think about a man or a woman?" I would ask Zuri.

He can't apply tests to me. They are biased. They are useless. How can he evaluate me? How could anyone? I know what to answer, I know what to say or see. Even with a psychiatrist, I would tell him what he'd expect to hear.

When he said those things, was in a hostile way? Was he attacking me or defensive? No... he just thought of using the tests from that moment. From when it all surfaced.

I didn't even looked for the MMPI-2 results.

Catherine met me outside. I accompanied her to pick up her letter. I waited outside the internet place. I was parked but I felt all the people and cars around me. I felt their presence and their sights.

We ate pizza in the beach. We stayed outside the park. We talked about things, about feelings. I can't remember the themes. I just remember seeing me in the mirror, looking hideous, closing it and escaping its screams. I tried to put make up again, but it made it worse. It was unfix-able. Moments later the hobo came to the window and complimented us.

We went to wal mart and saw things. We bought condoms and I found her mascara. I bought it.

After the movie we bought two planners. Like the one she had seen and one similar. I might try to fill it.


## 2016-01-22

"I was furious when I read the posts asking for interns with a pay of 1000 pesos the week"
"Have you started your social service? Do you know of somebody looking for a place?"

I didn't remember. Yesterday Catherine invited me. "Would you come with me to the bathroom?" Any other day I would walk and wait outside. Did I extend my hand or did she grab mine? She was ahead of me. She opened the door and I entered behind her. It's not the first time I've gone in the ladies' room. It's not the first time we've gone together. I remember looking at the stalls expecting somebody to be inside, seeing me and reacting. Informing me I don't belong.

It's not that I think I don't. I think they won't believe it.

She told me outside her house when they were in wal mart. How the cashier talked to her dad. She was telling him about this man who tried to entered to the ladies' room. she informed "him" it was the women's. That person stated that she was a woman. "He was a man, his hair was short, he as tall, he had beard..." The person was irritated and showed her. "He had a crack, he showed me his line". The "man" dropped their pants to show her a vulva.

I thought about it. Does a vagina make somebody a woman? Is that were the line is drawn? People love making the statement about chromosomes. Nobody can see them, they're not visible. You don't see them as you see somebody's hair or eyes. They don't show through any clothes. Not even naked can you see them. I could grow breasts. Even men without hormones sometimes grow them. I grew my hair. There are women with shorter hair. I've worn women's clothes and called sir and little brother. It's not the hair nor the clothes.

You could grow a beard or breasts with the right medication. But people don't see transgender people as the gender they feel. "There are no such thing as a girl with a dick, just men with tits".

So it's the line in the genitals?

When Catherine told me that story, I thought about myself. How I wished I could do just that. I wish I could just lower my pants and tell the world. "No, look, I do belong here."

... I'm not an impostor.

I know I'm not faking. I know who I am. I just don't believe that I can convince anybody else.


I already gave the letter of Rene and my carnet of the hours. I've finished therapy. I've finished my 100 hours. That process is over. Now I actually am in therapy, though.

I looked and found the results of the MMPI. The gender scale is not the highest one. The first is Depression, followed by psychasthenia. The third is social isolation and finally there lies the gender one.

It all fits. A depressive episode with thoughts of death and suicide. High rates of guilt and anhedonia. Excessive rumiation of bad thoughts or ideas. Phobias and anxiety. Tendency to repression and disassociation, isolation from others, loneliness. A problem with the role of gender and the identity.

It all fits. He may use it for his evaluation. He could put the lousy intent of a test with the play-doh, too.

So I killed another one of the excuses of problems.

My mother and father left for the farewell party of her boss. Before leaving, my dad entered my room and asked about the graduation. The dates. He noted them down in his phone. When would I go to Tecate? That was the one he was interested in. Is he planning in accompanying me? He might go and see. Is it really that important? Is just a test. It's worthless. ...is it?

I could apply to a master in a foreign country. I might not find a job but I could defend myself for a place in a master somewhere.

Argentina is a perfect place for people "in, uh, my situation".

Is it really mocking when I repeat that phrase or is just negating that it hurt me? Did it? What is it that hurts me more, a direct insult or a trying to being nice? An insult I know their intent. I know to ignore it. I know to hate the person and just leave. But with those kind of things? She tried to be helpful. She looked for a euphemism to refrain from the idea of telling me I'm sick.

I'm looking for a specialist. Healthy people don't need medication.

I hate the perception I get from Chevo and Jessica of pity. Their dismissal of it as something to be rejected.

"I've told you already, that thing about your sexuality doesn't bother me at all, I don't care about it".

Why does it hurt me? Why does it make me uncomfortable?

My father asked me if I wanted to go to the United States yesterday after they arrived from the party.

Today I awoke in the morning. I turned and saw the phone. It was early. I was so tired. Exhausted. I had said that I would go, but my body was so heavy and my head so troubled that I doubted it. I kept my eyes closed and tried to go back to sleep. It was like ten in the morning when my father entered the room to asked me. I just opened my eyes and said yes.

"Will we go alone?" I asked him. He was ready. "No, they are getting ready". The bathroom was empty so I just grabbed my clothes and entered. I picked one of the panties that Catherine gave to me. They're small, I wondered if I could wear them all day. I had forgotten about them until now.

Panties. I hate that word. I always try to avoid it when writing. Underwear, underpants... Is it because of the feminine connotation or is the childishness? I don't say tummy, either. Maybe a little bit of both. I hated the word girl. "Girly" was an insult. Beside being feminine, it was being a child. The first repressed feeling I accepted, was the dread of wasting my childhood. Not being a child, not playing, not enjoying myself.

Maybe I got it confused. I never got into being a boy because I didn't feel like one. ...
This kind of phrases irritate me. I hate to fall in that same narrative of being something I'm not. I'm not somebody trapped anywhere. Neither god nor anyone made a mistake.

Nobody will read this. Who do I want to convince?

Even now it feels uncomfortable admitting I was or wanted to be a girl. A small girl, a child, a kid.

"I had the nicest dream. I was a baby and my mother held me in her arms. She saw me and smiled and called me Lili"

That was the lamest and cheesiest line of all the movie. At least that way I felt it in the beginning. I can't accept it in myself.

Since the beginning I told Catherine, reassured her that I would not ask my parents to see me in a different way. To call me by a different name or pronouns. I would never ask them to be their daughter.

I imagined and fantasize and practice how I'd tell my dad, what I have to tell my mother still. Neither of those time do I even think about saying the name. About asking them anything. I can, I have, asked my father for money for the antidepressants. I don't mind asking my mother for money to pay for my psychotherapy sessions.

...but this? I wouldn't. I feel as if I were asking them for the resources to kill their son.

Their son doesn't exist. He won't die because he didn't lived. I won't say the same shit about a mask or that nonsense. I am their son, I am their Ivan. I was...

Ivan was dead. Ivan has always been dead. He was a living corpse who felt nothing. He was lifeless. I was never happy, I didn't enjoy anything. This is my chance of happiness. This is my path to living. I'd love their support... I can't write that I don't need it.

I won't die without it. I'll find a way.

I bought a purple sweater. My mother stayed in the car when we entered Target. I separated this time. I wandered among the aisles. Men's clothes, women's, purses, shoes... I watched, looked for nothing. Why didn't I just looked?

I feel I don't belong. I took two pills and yet the feeling didn't go away.

It's not that "I am not a woman". Or it is but not the only thing.

I worry about how I look. About how would people think. What if my father or brothers saw me. Luis looks at me, he notices.

He has asked. Why, if I want to tell him, do I fear his asking?

I asked Catherine about what could I look for. She answered that a blouse but I couldn't. I didn't. Luis bought his gift for his birthday.

I fell asleep when they went to Pizza Hut. I was dreaming something when Luis opened the door and woke me.

It was a peculiar feeling. I felt alive, awake, I was doing something, thinking about something, being somewhere. And then the impulse, a bolt of energy that brought me to reality. I opened my eyes and saw the world. That instant of disorientation, of not knowing. Not knowing where I am, what am I doing, what am I thinking , who am I...

I love that instant. In that instant I don't worry, nor I fear, nor I suffer. In that instant I don't am.

There are no quotes today. I've done nothing important at all.

I tried watching that Steven Universe cartoon yesterday at night. I remember lying in bed earlier. Opening the tablet and searching where I could watch it. The tablet turned itself off a couple of times and I gave up. Did I read?

I haven't finished that book. Is that another symptom of depression? I remember not being able to finish books, like the one from Granada and even a couple from a Song of Ice and Fire. I didn't even finish the second from the lord of the rings.

It's less than 250 pages and I'm barely after the middle.

I fell asleep and dreamed. I dreamed a lot. I remember very little from them. One I was in a bedroom. There a house of some kind but I can just recall images and scenery. There was a talk about a Toy Story movie. Some woman asked us for an interpretation, or did we asked her? I remember some phrase about identity and body perception. The second dream was in a university. It had certain connection with a past dream or a false memory. A certain kind of mission? A bomb? No, there was a student whom I had to follow. I would follow him because I knew he already was guilty. I knew where to go and at what to look.

Was it time travel? Alternate universes? I grabbed myself from another, a past one. I was different. I was me, a little younger. I looked completely like a woman, the other me did. She had long hair and a hat. There a little piece of metal in her eye, like a ring that was under the eyelid. I remember thinking how I couldn't even bear contact lenses and that version of me had jewelry in the eye.

She talked and people saw her as a woman. Nobody doubted it. Somebody asked for a name and I could notice the hesitation before speaking. The intention of saying Ivan. "Jessica", came out instead.

It was weird. Why that name? I didn't think of Chevo's Jessica. I thought about that childhood friend. The face. Now that I try to remember, I can see some of her in that face.

I can't remember much after that. There was another dream. It was like a videogame, there were guns and people. Shooting, it was some kind of neighborhood. I was scared, nervous. I feared of being hit, hurt. I woke up.

I was awake when I heard the sound of the door opening and closing. I knew it was my father and I knew he was leaving. I closed my eyes again and dreamed. The second time the door opened I heard it again. This time I payed attention for that familiar noise the paper bags make. I rose easily and ate.

I was so tired I didn't even think about it. It was automatic. I went back and turned off the lights. I slept until afternoon.

I've done nothing since then. I've seen some episodes of that kid's show. I feared I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. I feel tired, though. I started the words earlier so I can go to bed. I don't want to do anything.

I can see some of those symptoms in myself. I upped the dosage, maybe it's my body getting used to it again. I didn't forget.

Catherine has aches. That little, something in her back. Maybe tomorrow she will go to the doctor and get it checked.

Luis bought a game yesterday. Hyrule warriors. In there you can choose the player. There are Link and another characters. He chose a female one. "Why do you keep choosing girls?" He said he had to in that stage.

Today, he proposed I could buy him and Xbox one and he'd buy assassin's creed. In that game we could both play at the same time. He wanted to use certain character. A little later he corrected himself and said the other name. The woman. I thought about it. I use Lucina in super smash bros. He started choosing Robin. He uses a lot of others but he picked her lately. There is Splatoon where he picked the girl first. Then, Xenoblade where his character is a woman. He started making some comments about his weight. He's a teenager and in time of changes. But I'm scared.

What if it's not an irrational fear? What if he feels the same way I do?

I'd be lying if I say the reason that scares me is because of how much I am suffering and I wouldn't want him to go through the same.

I don't, but that's not the only reason. I am scared of what people would say or think. Two freaks in the same family. It must be my parents fault. It must be my own. He's confused and imitated me. I caused it. Maybe he noticed and wanted to be like me.

I was his role model.

He hasn't make any comments or other actions. A lot of people use female characters. I might be just looking for other thing to be scared or nervous about. It might be another symptom.

Is that another reason to be scared of telling him about me?

Hay dias donde no soporto el dolor de la soledad.

More than a hundred days I've been writing in english. I feel no energy to narrate this days. I know I dreamed something today. It's gone from my memories. I showered today and shaved. I changed my stinky clothes. I try to look presentable.

Yesterday Catherine fell asleep in the night. I looked some job offerings in that page. Why do I keep doing that? I won't send anything. I won't try. Yesterday I actually fooled me. I thought I would. I considered positions and looked for possibilities. I was enraged when I realized that more than half of those were looking for a female postulate. I saved a job offering. It wasn't specific to my profile. It was done with a high school graduate in mind. Patient and family attention. With my experience in the hospital I actually had a chance.

I saved it. I considered sending a curriculum right there. Just apply and wait. It was already today. 1, maybe, 2... In the morning it would be a right time. I just had to sleep, wait a little.

Morning came and I didn't wake up. I died again. I'm dead. I opened my eyes and rose but I'm not awake. I'm still numb, senseless. Floating lifeless in the routine. I didn't send a thing. Why? It's worthless. I have things to do. I have to go to Tecate and have the rehearsal of the ceremony and then all the procedure for the license.

Deep within I don't fool myself. I know it's fear what stops me. I am scared. I am scared of applying and being rejected. I'm scared of being hired and failing. I'm scared of getting the job and actually being good at it and growing up and getting old and dying.

I am scared. I am petrified with fear. I want to crawl to bed and lie there until night comes and the day never rises.

Am I scared of the doctor? Why do I want it to come then? Why do I want it to be now? Why do I want to see him and have an answer now? Having the prescription and going to the pharmacy and seeing the reaction of the clerk. His confusion or his stupid questions. Maybe there would be some remarks. That don't scare me. Having the pill in my hands and thinking about taking it. Thinking about its permanency and its effects, its consequences. Do those scare me?

I'd take them. I'd take them now and looked for me in the mirror. I'm scared of my own psyche I'm scared of what Rene could write. What if this stupid passenger ruins it for me? What if I have to cancel it because of this feelings? What if they are really fear and doubt? What if its nobody's fault but mine?

I won't tell Luis. I won't tell my Dad. They'll find out on their own. Somebody will find something, or a word will escape from my mouth and hide in their attention. I might tell Paola. Maybe. I'm still fool enough to think of me capable of that.

I know I won't add Eusebio or Paola on Twitter. I know I won't reach out for any of them.

Because I'm depressed, because I'm sad and now there is a big and dark cloud of bad thinking fogging my perception. There are a lot of bad decisions whispering in my ears.

I need help, and now that I need it the most is the hardest for me to reach out and ask it.

Catherine is sick. She went to the doctor today. She has a little abscess in her lower back. She is in pain.

I thought about her death. She won't die. I mean, she will, we all will. But there is no reason for thinking she will any time soon. Nonetheless that thought has crawled into my mind and grasped himself to the walls. What if she dies? What if she leaves. What will happen when she's gone?

I will be really lonely. I won't have a lover. I won't have anyone to find me attractive. Anyone to really see me as who I am.

I won't have nobody to talk to. I won't have anyone who would listen or understand.

I won't have a friend to confide in. I would be lonely. I would stop existing. I'd be him again or just a freak.

Am I that to the world?

Or am I that to myself when Catherine is not here to change my mind?

"I hate you. I hate you so much I could resuscitate you from fear"

I was in my bed. The room was black and dark. I had the night inside my bedroom. I talked to the silence as if she could listen to me.

"I never asked you for your love. I never asked you to support me. I asked you for your friendship, I asked you that you wouldn't leave. You promised me the ocean, the sea. I asked for a sip of water. I died from thirst."

I will never be free until I let her go. She left months ago. She lives her life and I still resent her. I still count her as one of my best friends in life and hurt her absence. The space that she left empty is only empty if I save it for her.


I stayed in bed again. This time it was different. I woke up early in the dawn. I had anxiety. I felt this tumult of energy flowing inside of me, urging me to move, to get up and run, to escape. I turned and couldn't keep my eyes closed. The feeling passed in some minutes and I fell asleep again.

I remember hearing the voices of the morning leaving for school. I stayed in bed. Noon was the time I got up.

I took two pills from the bottle and started the day.

Start the day. What does that mean? I write so much about the difference of living and just drifting lifeless. I see no difference in me now. I "live" for what? What is it that I do? What did I do today after I exited my room.

I took the pills that give me life and I spent it doing nothing. I felt a little better but I did nothing. Should I do something? I feel this need of what should be. Like a failed potential. Maybe they're just expectations that I'm not fulfilling.

I am burdened by both the emptiness of time and its pressure.

The pressure of living sucks the life out of me.

"I'm in that stage where I feel weird when some people call me sir while others call me son or buddy"

Gustavo posted that on Facebook. I read it and felt this strange sensation inside me.

"Â¿What did you think when you saw it?", Catherine asked me. "Bitch, please".

Some people call me sir and others call me lady.

Yesterday night I thought about telling someone. Anyone. Hilda, Melissa, even Johanna.

I have to tell my dad. I could tell Paola. What's the point in deflecting? The date comes closer.

"Dad, I have an appointment with a doctor..."

I could be blunter: "Dad, I made an appointment with an endocrinologist"

No, that would freak him out. I could tell him I'll make some tests because "of my situation"? That would have some funny reference. "I will go take some bloodwork because of my depression". Maybe I have this hormone imbalance that could worse things with me. I wouldn't be lying. I would be telling the truth in disguise.

I could be direct and honest first. Tell him as I've thought: "Dad, I've never talked with you about my depression. I've felt it most of my life in some way or another, but it really affected me since high school. It has some biological reasons, factors, but it is related to some other things. For instance, I've always felt lonely or had this difficulty with relating to people. I don't like my body either. Everything is connected. I don't like my body, I feel sad, I feel lonely. One affects the other, and the other and the first one. Like a chain...."

I could give a speech talking a lot. Walking around the border in a dry swimsuit instead of jumping. Then, when I've already tired myself. I could touch the water with my foot hoping to slip and fall: "I don't like my body because I don't like being a man."

I could just run and jump. "Dad, I am trans." Fuck him, fuck me, fuck everything. I would say it and deal with it later.

I'm scared I'll get so full with rage with myself that I'd end up doing that. Hitting him with the news. Provoking him with reality so he'd hit me back.

"Dad, remember sense8? The transgender woman.... I am like that. I am sorry, but I am like that."

Will I spent the next weeks until my appointment writing that sentences here instead of opening up to him?

"Mom, could you tell my dad I am trans?" Or will I end doing that?

## 2016-01-27

"Did he see me? That one time, months ago, in the movie theater. Did he see me? Did he ask you something? Have you told anyone?"

I found her ghost again in the darkness of my room. I thought about asking her. Her ghost is mute. Is a silent mocker who just smiles. I considered looking her up. How would it be talking to her again? Why do I keep thinking that? I threw the thought at her and hoped that it would make her disappear.

I won't look for her. I won't open to her. There is no point nor use. I have no use for any answer she could give me. I deflect, I ask about him but in real I just want to know how she saw me. She recognized me and smiled. That's the information I have. That should be it. So what if I looked ridiculous? So what if I looked like a woman and it freaked her out? So what if she liked it?

What difference would it make if he didn't see me or he did but didn't recognize me, or he did and did and asked her, or mocked me.

They live their life, I should fight for mine. I am not in hers and she won't be in mine.

"I hate you, like nobody in this world will hate you. I hate you, as nobody in this world can be hated. I hate you because you always are still there. I hate you so much I could make you resuscitate."

I have that song stuck in my head. I played it on repeat yesterday several times. I keep repeating it today. Is the thought of her that is stuck in my head? I feel like a betrayal to Catherine the emotions I still feel for Monica. Even if those are hate.

Why can't I let her go? Why do I keep her tied to me?

Even if she stays here hated, I am not alone. Letting her go is her really leaving. Is another loss. No, I haven't lost her yet. It's what I keep saying and telling myself. She left me but I keep her ghost with me. I am the one who calls for her. I am the one who hates her and thinks of her. I am the one who unfollows her and then looks for her news. I am the one who can't stand the idea of losing anybody.

Her leaving should prepare me for the rest of the people who won't understand. All the other "loved ones" who will leave and judge and hate.

Maybe I am scared of the hormones, of the change. I am terrified of looking for a job, and even if I can't admit it, I am afraid of going to the capital. I am afraid of starting the process of changing my name. Introducing myself, not as a woman, but as Sofia. Correcting my parents when they call me as Ivan, as their son.

Making them mistaken. Is their mistake making me this way? Is it mine, growing like this?

I felt anxiety when Catherine told me I and Anahi could go see Paola when she's in Zacatecas. It would mean telling her about me without Catherine by my side. It would mean telling her sooner than I thought.

I will tell her about the name. I will tell her everything and then I'll tell the other ones.

I saw Catherine today. I went to her house. I put on the purple sweater I had bought. At first I was wearing the jeggings. She asked me was I was wearing and I noted how worried she was. I changed and left. I shaved in the shower, I painted my face. I did shadowed with red my lips and then cleaned them after. When I put mousse on my hair. I was going to tie it but changed my mind. I grabbed a couple of bobby pins and styled it in a new way.

"From the window, as you stepped out of the car you did look very girly".

Her uncle was in the garage and was the first person to see me. Did he recognize me? She opened the door next. Her mother saw me after. She asked if I had something on my lips. From the window my face looked full of make up.

I just hid my beard and put that clear gel on my lashes.

We saw inside out and an episode of Jessica Jones. Her mother made squash with corn.

Tomorrow I'll see RenÃ© and take the mmpi results to him.

Of what could I talk?

## 2016-01-28

"I thought about leaving therapy, talk about that with Lilli. How would she charge me if I return and that stuff."

Why did that upset me?

I exited therapy in a fine mood. I was alright. I was fine before we started talking.

"Are you going out tomorrow?" My father asked me. He sent me a text message if I wanted something from the Carl's Jr mid-session. I didn't see it until after stepping out of the room. My phone was all out of credit and the message didn't send. I went to the oxxo and gave all my money. When the message did send, my father answered me back he had already bought the chicken pieces. That's what my mother brought me yesterday.

I didn't say anything. It didn't matter. Whatever, I liked them. It was a disappointment, though.

Luis won't go to school tomorrow. It doesn't matter either. My father told me I could just leave after I make him breakfast. At his age I didn't stay home alone. It wasn't until a year later when I started.

I was 13 years old, I was in jr high. It wasn't the first time I stayed here that I did it. I remember thinking about it. I resisted. The idea came up since the prefects came to the classroom and gave us those little papers. I had the temptation. I thought about it, dreamed about it. I tried to avoid it as much as I could. Then I just entered my father's room and entered their closet.

I remember the shame, the reflection and seeing me myself. I wish I could forget that. It's not the same as looking me now. Now it might still be a secret but it's not forbidden. There is no guilt. I guess.

What does it mean that Catherine stops going to therapy. What would Lilliana say to her. She won't deny her leave. She hasn't change a little thing from the relationship with her parents. Her father still doesn't know. Neither about her nor me.

But I can't pressure her. I can't ask her to say anything because I haven't either.

My father was alone today when my mother went to her course. Miguel was in here and Luis in his room. My father was available in his. I have to tell him. I have to say it now. I can't keep it inside anymore. It's burning me, it's poisoning me.

I fantasized about blowing my brains out when I was in Spain. I put my fingers in my temple and closed my eyes. They were a loaded pistol. I could feel their cold and steel point. I awaited the bullet that would never come.

I would lie if I say that I have no thoughts like that anymore. There is no gun now, I don't make my fingers into anything.

I feel a cold blade. It's razor sharp and its cut is barely felt. My throat opens and warm blood spills. Would my secret come out finally? Could I finally talk?

I sound sick. If Rene could read this he might worry again. He might ask to see me more frequently again.

My father now knows that I have the letter of therapy. He hasn't asked me when will I stop going like Catherine's. I await for that. I hope he will come and questions me. "How more sessions will you go?" or "Why do you still need to therapy?" Something like that which gives me an opening and I could answer back.

"I haven't finish with my therapy. I need it now most than ever. It's stressing me out not having a job. Being ignored or denied. That besides my depression and my body..." I would take it out and expect him to see it, notice it and say something.

"Yeah, I don't like my body. I don't like being a man."

Would that be enough? Or do I just want to say the least necessary?

Will I tell him I am not a man. Will I mention the clothes or the name? Will I ever?

Lilly has a job and a new offer. Beatriz can't go tomorrow because she has a job. A couple of days ago, Elena posted a picture of herself with a corporation polo, titled "me at my job".

I don't know how they do it. I don't know how they can.

They have experience, they are women.

"What are you doing?" "I just want to see when you finish... I'm counting the number of words"
"Leave, I don't want to play chess"

I could had let him stay. He could had read about my body, my father. He doesn't understand much of english but he could know.

I threw him out instead. Because it makes me uncomfortable to be open, to be vulnerable and being read. I want him to know, I want all of them to know but I throw them out.

## 2016-01-29

"And for the lady?"

What is it with those comments that lift my mood for the rest of the day?

I have a headache. It's pulsing like a second heart inside my temples. I put the same song of these latest days. I shared it with Catherine. Monica's name came up again.

"Two people are in front of you: one who loves you and one whom you love. You are given the choice of hugging just one. Which would you pick?"

"What would you do?" she asked me.

"None".

It happened. An afterimage of the memory comes to my eyes. Like an old projector which starts humming and show it. A mute and color-less movie. Catherine and me sitting in Argana's pillows. Monica and me sitting in the dark seats of my car. I had that choice. I had to choose. One whom you love and one who loves you. Catherine loved me and I loved Monica. I was tempted by those new sensations and urges, I liked being loved and needed and wanted. But I was afraid of leaving normality. I wanted that routine back, the security of the known.

It was an impossible choice so I backed up. None. I would stop with both. I'd escape and leave. I ended up going after both.

Times have changed. I have changed.

I love Catherine and she loves me. Monica... she's gone. No, her phantom's here. Do I have a phantom with her? Is she haunted by me old persona's memory? The one whom I stopped being. Just like the Monica she wasn't anymore.

Who cares? What does it matter?

My mother woke me up in the early morning. She brushed her teeth and vomited. Her screeches came in a stampede towards my room. They entered through the opened door and shook me from the sheets. I tried to hide from them under my pillow but they came back and jumped over me. She finally left and I lost my sleep. I could use the opportunity and just get up. Maybe that would help me later to readjust my sleep schedule. Make it easier for me to fall asleep now. It's almost midnight and I have a throbbing headache since mid-afternoon.

I made breakfast for both Luis and me. I had time enough to shower and shave. Get ready. Yesterday I had picked up the clothes I'd wear. The jeggings and the lycra shorts were already over my chair. I could wear the long shirt over them. I just washed the long sleeved t-shirts. That was another option. When I woke up, I changed my mind. I took a pair of jeans. Luis was here, he would see me. He does see me. He notices and asks questions. How can I be that hypocrite to reprimand myself for not speaking up and not daring, and yet I still hide from them.

There was that other feeling. I hadn't stood in front of the mirror. I hadn't seen myself. I had only the image of how I perceived myself. I made a construction of my with just how I felt. I saw me as hideous. How could I wear those kind of things? I had that image in mind when I doubted again what to wear. I looked myself in the mirror. Times have changed. It used to upset me that the image of myself and the reflection didn't match. I felt myself as a woman and then my reflection would laugh at me. It would see me and mock me and laugh.

Now it's the other way around. I feel like this enormous and disgusting blob of a man. I dare to catch a glimpse and I look different. I look androgynous. I look like whatever I want. Now the problem is inside my head.

I picked Catherine up and went to the university. My letter is not ready yet. I haven't cleansed my face.

I took her to her session. She might close it. For now, at least. It hurts me to pause. It hurts me that she closes off the person with whom she talks about us. One of the handful of people who knows about me, who doesn't mix up. Who sees me.

She will talk with her dad. Not tomorrow nor next week. Maybe not even soon. But she will. He will know.

Do I wait for her to tell him so I can pressure myself to tell mine?

I'll tell Paola first.

I doubted how I looked. I decided to not wear lipstick. It was this weird feeling of not being seen. Of being mistaken.

Ramon came and said hi to Catherine. When I reached my hand, did he get close to kiss my check too? Or was it just his intention of pointing the place where his shoulder hurt?

People turned to me and scanned me. They turned more when Catherine kissed me.

I felt validated, confirmed, when the waiter looked at me and asked for my order. Was he just patronizing me? Did he know?

No. No. I won't take this from me. Not today.

For him I was a lady.

## 2016-01-30

I feel just like that other time weeks ago when the father and his baby saw me outside Rene's office. "Look at the girl", he told his baby. I repeated his words to myself when I was in bed.

What is it with me that I look for outsider's validation? Does it change anything when a third person looks at me and calls me with one of those words? Maybe they are condescending, maybe all the others are disgusted. There are a thousand maybes. Why do only some of them lift my mood? Why does it change anyway? I felt like I didn't fool anyone. To me, it was as if I were just a boy in girls' clothes.

"I didn't expect it either", told me Catherine yesterday. "You looked ambiguous. Your face was clean, there was no beard but no make up on your eyes or lips, either. You were wearing the jeggings."

She had mentioned that before. Me looking ambiguous. That was what I wanted at first. That was my goal two years ago when all of this started to come up. I wanted to be nothing. I wanted people to feel doubt. Everyone would see me and wouldn't know what I would be. "Is that a boy or a girl?" I wouldn't be invisible or ignored. I could be anything. They would be accepting by omission. No matter what I'd do, I'd be playing it safe. I fantasized with the idea of unconditional acceptance.

Now it's not enough. After all this time, I look for them. I wear the clothes now not just for me, not just for how I feel. I can see myself now, I can take pictures and let others see me. I wear them and I want to be out. I want to be seen and called something. I want to test them. Test my looks. I want to know how I'm seen.

I was nervous, I felt naked and vulnerable that day of july when we went to the pride parade. I remember changing clothes in the men's bathroom in that jack in the box. I got out and I felt everybody's eyes on me. There was this man standing near us in the bus stop. It was raining and Catherine was kissing me. I looked his way. Was he seeing us? What was he seeing?

Months later I would wear the leggings even before crossing the border. I would wear them as the normal clothes before changing. Halloween was the day. That other day when I was outside. The first one when known people saw me. That picture was the one that provoked Monica's argument. It was the last picture I sent her.

I would wear the skirt outside the hotel and my car for the first time. No. That's not true. Weeks before I was seen in that same disguise by Chevo and Jessica and Paola. Andrea was the first one the see me.

I remember being with Anahi that day. She didn't know my name yet, did she? She did. Catherine used it when she talked to her on her phone. In the United States nobody referred to me directly in any way. When we crossed back, a man approached us with a flyer and called us "girls".

I felt this same feeling which I'm talking about. It was addictive. It wasn't a sexual thrill. It was something more. A validation, a joy. All my life I felt invisible and people saw me. I was seen and noticed. I wanted to be out still. I didn't want to change yet. I asked Catherine if she wanted to do something. I wanted to go the plaza, maybe drink something. Anything. I wanted to be outside and seen.

Catherine was tired and I changed back later outside my home.

I've worn some clothes several times since then.

I've been called by different ways. And every time it's less enough. It's not an addiction. What is it?

I told Rene that it scared me having a date. What if it's prolonged? What if the time comes and somehow I miss it? What if I go to the appointment and I have to wait even more?

Even the waiting time that is certain, knowing how long it is makes it painful. The shorter the wait, the more it burns. It's like that sensation of needing to use the restroom and the closer you get, the more urgent is the need.

There is just two months now. Give or take 10 weeks to meet the doctor.

I have like 10 sessions with Rene before going. Will I tell my parents before that?



## 2016-01-31

"When will you take the suit to the tailor? The person might have a busy schedule, you must go soon."

"To most of those things, I'll be there with you, Sofi. You won't be alone"

I dreamed with Catherine. We were in my room naked and having sex. I came on her and she screeched loudly. My father came to my room and questioned what was that made a mess. He wanted me to show him to see if it could be cleaned. I was on my stomach butt naked. I tried to make him leave, but he insisted. He was oblivious to the fact that we were having sex.

In another dream I remember some sort of school, a building in which we both, again, were walking. Did we find her or did she? Zayra stopped us. No, she stopped me. No, we were leaving together and asked me a question. She asked me to say a little longer. Was I still interested in the project? Were we both? I called Catherine.

In another dream I was outside. There was my family too. It was like when we get ready to leave the house. Like a trip or something like that. The Mitsubishi was parked in front of the two cars. I walked to the trunk to put something there or take something out. My mother was there, too. She was trying to tell me something. "Don't you think it's time that you tell your dad about you?"

It was. I should. I had to. I remember the feeling of urgency. Now? No, later, when we were alone. How can you say something like that? Do you have to wait for a perfect moment or do you have to actually make the moment?

I woke up.

I finished seeing Steven Universe. Yesterday, before going to bed I saw the episode where they are in a motel. Ruby and Sapphire are arguing about how they feel with what Pearl did to Garnet. In the end of the episode they hug, they both are crying and apologizing and they laugh and fusion again.

"My laughy Sapphi"

I cried several times yesterday and today watching that children's cartoon.

"Are you watching that video?" Luis came to my room to see what was I doing again. I was on youtube after sharing a video of a song to Catherine. "Yes", I told him. I wasn't ashamed nor embarrassed. Why should I be?


Rinna posted a picture in Facebook about the differences in the definitions of trans terms. In english, I explained to Cath, they use transgender mostly now. It encompasses most of the trans community, like some sort of umbrella term. It means everyone who feels dysphoria with their gender and sex. Whose sex and gender don't fit.

Transsexual, in english, is a dated term mostly out of use outside the medical community. It's exclusive to people who have gone through medical and or social transition. It has this binary association, too.

In Spanish, there is some persistence with separating both terms. In English all transsexual people are transgender, but not all transgender people are transsexual.

The image which posted Rinna had the definitions of Cross-dresser, Transgender, someone who "identifies with the other gender. Most of them go through social and or medical transition to appear like women or men, and Transsexual, the ones who "feel like a gender trapped in another body". They correct this mistake with surgery on their genitals.

In Mexico and most Hispanic countries, the terms are separated. Transgender are the ones who "appear" to be the other gender. Transsexuals are the ones who have "the surgery". It annoys me this obsession with GRS. Again, it's like the only important thing is our genitals.

Our. I didn't write their, I wrote our.

Which am I? I am transgender. I've been transgender since two years ago. Even when I wear these clothes. Even when I'll wear a suit and formal clothing to both Tecate and my graduation, I'll still be whom I am.

With the hispanic terms, it's like I have to tell them about my genitals. They have to know them to know how to call me. Just to know what is the appropriate term I have to disclose the situation of my genitals. Dealing with this, my junk stops being an intimate matter and becomes public. Just telling them "I am transgender", I am telling them I have a penis.

They should not care. It's nobody's business but mine.



## 2016-02-01

I followed Paola in Twitter. Yesterday I did it impulsively. It didn't work and I tried again. It did nothing. I left the phone and went to bed. I was talking to Catherine, I remember. I think so. She fell asleep before I did. In those moments of loneliness I grabbed the phone again and tried once more. This time I clicked the little oval of my face and a green checkmark appeared under it. I clicked accept. It was done.

She might already had seen it. Catherine posts things in her own profile. She tags me and has retweeted posts of mine. Paola and Chevo might have seen already how she writes she thinks I'm pretty or how she loves me. Maybe it was just a confirmation. Maybe it did surprised her.

I wondered if I could send her a text message to her. Telling her about the name, about me. Saying how she knows before Chevo and Jessica. "See, I don't want to leave you out." Asking her what she thinks about me telling Paola.

It worries me. What's her opinion on my name? Is it just a nickname? Is it just something to appease me with? Maybe I do project my own rejection unto others.

That wasn't how I felt when I woke up and saw the notification of her username following me.

I felt acceptance. I felt less alone. I was excited. I stayed in bed. The bed was so comfortable and cozy. I didn't want to get up. I did not until after noon. Luis came to my room and asked me, no, told me, we were going to eat. "It's too early", I answered.

He left. It was 1 o'clock.

I got up and swallowed my pills. I have just enough for tomorrow and the day after. I might need to ask Rene for a new prescription. It's more than 6 months old.

They have not said anything about it, but if they deny it to me, I would have to go one day without it.

I told my father about my glasses. They are loose and opened. One lens falls out from the rim. It was a mistake. He told me we could go to the optic and ask for a repair. They might ask for them back. I couldn't stay without glasses. I have already accustomed to this new prescription. Going back would be a headache.

My mother had to go anyway to repair hers. I didn't get off. I waited.

They asked me again about when will I go to the tailor. Will I go tomorrow? I should take it now. Fix it. Do something.

I don't want to. I don't want to wear it, I don't want to put it on and let someone take measures of it. I don't want to. I don't care. I don't care if it doesn't fit, if it looks hideous. I don't want it.

I should go anyway.

My mother saw my face when she asked me. Did she related it with what she knows? Does she still know? Does she remembers?

We went to this brazillian restaurant of meat. A sort of buffet where they keep offering you these fancy cuts. It was expensive. I drank a glass of sangria and my head hurts. I am irritated. I feel... something.

I have to go to the tailor and to the pharmacy. My mother gave me the money to the therapy. She asked me right after telling me of the tailor. She did relate it. She does remembers.

It might just be about giving me money. Paying for a service I need. Just as I would need their money to fix the suit, I need their money to go to therapy. To treat "my situation".

I was lying in bed thinking about everything and nothing I opened the calendar. I have the appointment on april 7th. A little more than two months.

I have less than 10 weeks. Ten weekends in which I can tell my parents.

I told my mother already. I talked and told and confessed. I shared. I felt this kind of euphoria and excitement the next day. Will it be like that when I tell my dad? Will his reaction be different?

Will I cry as much?

"I have women's pants" I said to him.

"You don't notice. I've worn make up and you haven't realize." I was about to say to him.

It was the alcohol in me.

Will it be cheating if I drink before?

Could I just tell my mom about the doctor and ask her to tell my dad?

Why does it feel forbidden? Who forbade it?

## 2016-02-02

"I was downtown and she came up to me. 'Hi, do you remember me?' 'Uh, yeah' 'I know you are angry with me, but I wanted to explain myself. I know Ivan is upset, too.' 'Sofia' 'That's what I wanted to explain, that's what won't understood. I had a puppy called Sofia, that's why I can't call her that, not yet.' "

She dreamed with Monica. I received her text in the morning and that little intro. The dream continued. She couldn't get rid of Monica. She followed Catherine with her explanations. She wanted to be understood. The first thing I thought when I read the conversation was how it was unbelievable. "She would never call me by the feminine".

Now, she wouldn't care being understood. She doesn't care about what we think of her. I imagined me opening a bridge and meeting her with a white flag. "Catherine dreamed about you tonight"

"I don't give a fuck", her phantom mocked me.

I woke up sick. I fell asleep sickening. I remember lying under the sheets and feeling the steely cold cutting my body. Like a sharp knife it penetrated the covers and sliced through my bones and muscles. I shrank my body into a little ball and hid static. Every little move was an opening and invitation to the cold.

I was burning. My head was throbbing. I thought about Catherine's patient. Ivan. The young homosexual man who died because of a acute case of meningitis.

Catherine never could give him closure.

What if that happened to me? What if my infection was fatal, too?

I fell asleep. I tossed and turned in a febrile haze. I half lived a semiconscious nightmare. The feeling of worry, of an unfinished task. The burden of responsibility and the imminent threat of failure. All the classic symptoms of my sick nights.

I woke up in the early morning and did some things. I went back to bed and tried to sleep again. I stayed in bed until the evening when Luis and my mother arrived from school. He was covering his head with the hat he bought in Disneyland. He wore a pair of blue skinny trousers. They cut his hair. I could see it in his face the feeling of wrongness. That uneasiness of looking different than how you'd like. I saw myself in him. More than ten years ago I was in his place.

"If you don't want to cut it, don't cut it. Tell your principal how he's being sexist. He doesn't ask the girls to cut their hair, does he?"

Nobody told me that when I was a kid. Nobody gave me that option. Of course I'd never take it anyway. "Sure, they might say that it's part of the dress code and if you want to have long hair you must wear the skirt, too."

If somebody had gave me that option, would I had taken it? I don't think so.

Why wouldn't I?

If I were with a psychiatrist and gave that answer that would mean a little cross on their mental checklist. I should had these feelings for most of my life. If I didn't have them when I was a kid, when they did arose? If they came suddenly, what was their cause?

It's not like that. I can see myself as 12 years old. Seeing that weird series in the Discovery kids. Was the one about a little angel? No, was it? That was a kid's soap opera. No. That was a mexican soap opera from the late 90's, the show I'm remembering was a South american series or soap opera. There was this boy whom I couldn't tell if he was a boy or a girl. He had long hair. I was amazed by it. Long hair to me was something feminine. He was wearing it. And instead of being mocked or harassed, it was nothing.

The doubt, the ambiguity was something I felt intrigued by. Could I be like that? Could I let my hair grow and people wouldn't know what or who I am?

I wanted long hair. I knew I had to cut it still in jr high. But My goal was High school when I could let it grow. I anticipated mockery and being misgendered. It never happened. And I got depressed.

Yeah, if they would had given me that option "leave you hair grow but wear the girl's uniform" I wouldn't had taken it. Because I wouldn't be seen as a girl. I would never be that kid. People would knew I was a boy, a boy in a girl's uniform.



## 2016-02-03

I'm still sick. I am tired and exhausted.

"My first pay as a psychologist", somebody wrote.

How the fuck do they do it? Where do they go? Whom they look for?

Yesterday Elena sent me message in Facebook. "Hey, cutie boy, how are you?"

It was awkward. Up from her text was her picture symbolizing the absence of a history. We had never talked before in there. She is the kind of people who uses compliments as openers. They lose their meaning. Saying everyone is beautiful is saying nobody is. I was just thinking about that in the morning.

I haven't taken hormones and I've gone out. I've been seen as a woman. Catherine's therapist called me her beautiful girl. A homeless person approached us in the car and told us how we were really pretty. Do they tell everybody? Did we deserve it? Even if I'm not attractive or good looking, I should feel validated. It's as if I had put myself a really high bar to pass. Did I want me to fail? I have passed without hormones. Not everybody does it. Not everybody can. I wasn't harassed or mocked. I miraculously passed the impossible test and yet I saw it as not being enough.

When she didn't answer back I thought about her latest post. Talking about a promotion, feeling blessed in her new job. The opportunities whatever... Would she offer me a position? Maybe she has to fill a vacancy, she knows I'm smart, she knows I'm capable. Why else would she come to me.

And yet, I wasn't relieved or excited. I got scared. I thought about excuses. Reasons which I could give to free myself. I felt like I was drowning. When I took consciousness of my own thoughts and reactions I questioned them.

What is it about a job that terrifies me?

What is it that makes me unable to find one? To even look for one?

She finally answered back and it wasn't about job. "Did I know about a movie that exemplified the theory of Bandura?" I was furious. She has a job and it's not able to do it. She looks for my help and will get paid for it. She doesn't even know about Bandura. "The vicarious learning?" I asked her. Bandura made numerous research with different approaches to Social Learning. "Learning by modelling" as if she knew what she was talking about. I gave her the answer she was looking for and ignored her thanks.

Yesterday I gave Luis his presents. I waited for him to open them and record it. I hate the pictures my family take. They look so fake and artificial. The poses fabricated and maintained until the shot is taken. I stood with them and smiled. I was wearing pajamas and my hair was a mess.

This first, my dad told him giving him my present. "No, no, that one first", I answered back. It was theirs. The gifts were in a bag and he knew what they were. He bought them with them. He chose them. He opened the clothes and the money. He took the drone out. It was now the time to open mine but my parent ignored it. Luis is in the mainframe excited and opening the boxes, trying to guess. My dad is too busy looking at the drone, talking with Miguel about the battery and the instructions. They didn't care. They ignored it.

Did I think about telling him about me as a way to scream for his attention or was it then a way of getting back at him?

Tomorrow I will have to leave the house. I will shower and get dressed and go to therapy. Last session I didn't talk about my mood being uplifted when the hobo saw me. I could mention the waitress referring me or the importance I place upon being noticed and seen.

I could talk too about the realization of that high expectations I had even before starting. I looked at people's timelines and was surprised by how they looked. Before and after their transition.

"They looked so... normal".

Masculine men, bearded, some even handsome. People I would see in daily life and I would never imagine it. Sure, some were the typical profiles I imagined but those others? Most look extremely different from their first pictures after starting hormones and their last ones months or years after them. Like completely different persons.

Almost nobody passed in those first months.

And yet, I expected to. I wore the clothes and stepped outside and faced the world.

I still do.

## 2016-02-04

"I will tell you three things, but only one of them will be true: I still think about you when I masturbate; I always remember you when I listen to this song called 'I hate you', I grabbed all of your gifts and pictures and mementos and threw them out"

Yesterday I thought about telling everyone again. I was lying in bed, waiting to fall asleep while my mind was running wild planning different paths in which the future could unwind. I saw myself again, posting some sort of Facebook thing. Like those idiotic things people use to pass the time. Those kind of social games. "Like this, comment this and I'll do something". It would be a little different. I would not expect a lot of people to actually see it.

"Send me a message and I'll answer back three statements. Only one of those is true. You can't make any question or intent to guess which one is real."

Later I imagine posting "I'm trans" and other two non-sense things. Then I thought about my own family. Would I post them the same thing? What if Monica liked it? Of course she wouldn't... but what if? That's when I thought about her again.

I actually mentioned her to Rene.

I think about that day in November, outside the movies. What was her impression. I talked to him about seeing my own reflection in the mirror and then seeing me in the eyes of others. Just after that I mentioned her and my curiosity of that day. It was a little later that I remembered the actual question I suppress.

"Did your boyfriend saw me?"

Did he? Did he noticed us? Did he ask her something? Did she tell? What happened?

If he did see me, was I recognizable? If he did recognize me, what was he reaction? I think about his reaction because I already know hers. I know the one of someone who supposedly loved me, it would be invaluable to meet the reaction of someone who despised me.

I sent her a text message in her birthday, but that was before we talked again. What was it again the reason I opened up that bridge? I remember how I was the one who sent the white dove. But why? I remember, too, how we stopped and why. She sent me a text in my birthday months later. Almost one to next week.

If I ask her, what would it mean? Would I lose this streak? This 96 days I have of writing daily, this 96 days of exploring my own self, loving Catherine, loving me.

Four days till a hundred. And now the thought of asking her that day is firm and heavy. In the hundredth day I could open that bridge and ask her. "Did he see me that day we met outside the movies?" That's the only thing I am interested of knowing.

That's not true. What I really want to know, what I really want to ask her is "Do you ever miss me?".

What I want her to know is, "I hate you. I haven't forgiven you, and because I know you don't even care is why I don't know if I ever will."

Why is it that I should forgive her of exactly?

What is that terrible thing that she did to me? She forgot me? She left? She promised her love and couldn't give her friendship? She was Ivan's lover, she was Ivan's best friend. I am not him. I killed him. I am the one who might ask for her forgiving.

No. No.

She insulted me and told me she couldn't be my friend. She is not ready to see me, to treat with me. I understood. I gave her the option to leave. I was then that Monica who gave Ivan the permission to go to the park even though I wanted him to stay.

I won't ask her. I won't talk to her. Not in these next four days, not soon.

I thought about writing that I could tell my dad this hundredth day. Would I really?

Now it just irritates me. Even pretending that I believe myself when I think of it makes me mad.

Catherine will arrive monday. I could buy her a cake for when I meet her at the airport. Next wednesday we will meet with Paola. I might be actually able to tell her. Except Rene changed the date and time of our next meeting and I just remembered.



## 2016-02-05

I remember that time I made Luis feel like crap. The time I screamed at him and could see his face full of guilt and shame.

Today I made him cry. He ran from the kitchen to his room and closed it behind him. He put the lock and held it while I tried to opened it. "I don't want you to enter" he said and I realized I was a monster.

I stood there in the darkness, waiting. I don't know what exactly was I expecting, what was I waiting from him. I just stood there.

All for just a couple pieces of fucking chicken. I laughed at him. I really laughed like I haven't in a while. Even Miguel followed my laugh. I wasn't mocking him, was I? I was... "I picked them and I won't even taste them" It was so tragic I had no choice but to laugh.

Arguing, counting, setting aside the pieces and administering the rations. We were so pathetic. How wouldn't I laugh?
I put all the chickens from the bag back in the plate. Why should we cook them separated? I could cook them all at once. We could separate it later. Since the beginning I knew that I wouldn't really eat all of them. Why did I say it anyway? Why do I mock him? Do I want him to hate me, to get away?

I came back after I cooked everything. I stood in that same spot of the second floor. I didn't say anything but listened. He was still sobbing. His sobbing was full of pain and sorrow. It was the sound of loneliness. I caused it.

"Won't you eat?" "Later, not now" "Everything's ready" "I'll go in a minute" "It'll get cold" "I'll go"

He hasn't come. I feared Miguel would eat the pieces. Would it be my fault? I made them for him. I told him they were ready. I did what I could. Why do I still feel like crap?

I woke up in pain again. This time I didn't open the eyes until after noon. I thought it was early like the days before. I grabbed the phone and saw the time and notifications. My throat was soar and it hurt. I took my pills and drank water. I haven't done nothing since.

"Ivan, have you eaten already?" His tone cheered as always. Like if nothing had happened. Do I resents him now? I remember how Monica used to tell me she hated when people acted like nothing had happened after a huge argument. I never understood her. What did she want exactly?

When I was outside his room I thought about entering and hugging him. Telling him my secret. Would I use that information as a bargaining chip? "Don't be mad at me anymore and I'll tell you something delicate". Or would it be like the times I would cry in Tae Kwon Do when I wouldn't meet the Instructor's expectations, and then I'd blame it on the pain of my surgery. He would realize it later. He told me he wouldn't want me to cry ever again. I stopped going.

It was hard, it was painful. I was accustomed to exceeding at everything I'd do. I never met with frustration. I succumbed at the first obstacle.

Do I think about telling my dad? What is it that stops me? It's not his reaction, it's not his perception, what the fuck is it?

"I like wearing woman's clothes"

I said it to myself in the bathroom and it felt embarrassing. It's the truth. I'm wearing woman's underwear right now. I like woman's pants more than man's. I like when people see me as a woman. Why does it shame me to admit it to my family?

Catherine asked me where could we go for her birthday next week. We talked about different restaurants. She'd invite everyone and just wait for the ones who'd show up. Miguel, Anahi, Yarely and her boyfriend, Chevica, Paolas, Vania and me.

Everyone would know about me. Everyone but her friend. What could I wear?

Should I hide? And that same thought came again. It all comes down to who knows. Whom am I hiding it from still? It'd be easier if all of them knew. Paola doesn't know still but I want to tell her. Will I? Will I really?

If my parents knew I could talk about it with them. Do I want to talk with them about this?

I need their support. Why is it so difficult to even fantasize about asking for their help?

## 2016-02-06

I lied on the bed shortly after writing yesterday's words. By 7 and a half I was already asleep. I remember dreaming but not what they were about. One of them was a nightmare. It came now. I was in my own bed with my arms over my stomach, hands crossed. I remember noticing myself, my own position, and thinking how it was a feminine one. One hand was grabbing the other just under my chest and the other way lower over my crotch. Yeah, there were two pair of hands and I realized the impossibility of being alone. I freaked out when the extra arms started grabbing and pulling me.

It was midnight.

Was it today?

Now I just felt as if it were a long and distant memory from a past far away. Was it yesterday when I made Luis cry? Then I woke up in the midnight and went to the living room and watched tv. I came back and slept again. Was it really yesterday? At what time did I wake up today?

My father went to buy breakfast. It was today. I had the idea of us going to the United States. We have to buy the stuff for my grandmother's kitchen. It's saturday and there might be things in the P.O. Box. So when I heard the sound of the door I thought my dad went just for coffee. He bought the usual and birria. Luis was upset again. My father had asked him if he wanted tacos and he said yes, but something about the place and how he liked the soup better. I don't know.

I ate around 9 or 10. I tasted a couple of spoons of the glass of soup that was left. Now I ate a beef taco from yesterday and the partial hotdog that was forgotten in the fridge.

I showered today and shaved. I shaved my legs and my face. I had nicks all over my shins, and was frustrated at the black dots in the chin. Whatever, two passes and a final one in the chin. Nobody will see me anyway. I did it for me. For the mirror.

I knew I'd feel lonely this couple of days. It's like... it's like I am not conscious of it. I feel it, it surrounds me but I forget about it. I just don't want to do anything, don't know whom to talk, whom to reach. Anything is a burden and the energy is not worth it.

Maybe it has to do with the guilt of yesterday. Luis' remark of "I don't want you to enter". He was sobbing and crying. Those were just a couple of pieces of chicken. I did fall on the ground laughing about his words. "I picked them and won't even taste it".

This morning I was upset with him. Like if it were his fault. Like he betrayed me. Being closed was some kind of permission to hurt each other.

"Thanks, Ivan" he said before going upstairs again.

Today he reminded me while we all were in my parents bedroom talking about his lack of sentri. "Like yesterday, when I wouldn't had tasted the wings I picked" as if he were reminding me this hilarious joke we shared.

That's the reason we didn't go and won't tomorrow either. Luis doesn't have a sentri anymore. After his birthday it expired. Mine it's the last one that expires, but my mother already has hers.

A couple of days ago my father came from the united states and gave the plastic card to her. "It arrived in the mail". They have their date of the appointment the last of february. After then it's two weeks for the replacements to arrive.

I don't have an appointment. Mine expires until 10 months ahead. Even then I have no way of proving my own economic sufficiency. Again, it all comes down to having a job.

I have to find one, get one. I won't apply to the master until way after that.

It doesn't matter. First it's the trip to Tecate and then the graduation and license. After that I will worry about a job.

I've been worrying since last year. It's just that I don't do anything about it. I sent curriculums but they didn't call me back. I was proud of my own resume. I was foolish and naive. Of course they didn't like it. But what is it that they want?

A woman? A man?

What do they want and what can I offer them?

## 2016-02-07

I finished Interstellar. I started where I left that other day, like 20 minutes from the beginning.

That's everything about today. All of the interesting things that happen, just a movie.

Why did I look for her again? Was it something in me that made me click her name in the stupid side bar I don't even usually use in Facebook? I saw her name and that green bright spot. I was talking with Catherine. "I feel lonely, too", was the last message I sent her yesterday before she fell asleep. Tomorrow she will come back. I'll pick her up from the airport. I'll get up early and go pick a cake. She sent me the address of the bakery. It's downtown. I could go there early and then just drive to the airport. I have to buy gas, too.

I open the conversation of Monica. 98 days. But that conversation it's not the last. It's from the second to last day we saw each other. It's from that day back in august I saw her after months. I remember that day now and I actually feel sorry for myself. It hurts me. It's this faint burn that I never really noticed. Was I going to park in the sanborn's or inside the plaza? She would meet with her friend -her now best friend- minutes after she'd see me. That's the day she set for meeting with me after months. More than 6 months. We haven't talked in person since then. I got my book back and gave her hers. I saw her face, I met the Monica I wasn't in love with.

I could had just left it there. Remember that day and went on with my day. Think about tomorrow, this week. Anything.

No, I clicked her name and let the browser drift to her profile page. It's a shortcut. I can avoid looking for her in the search box, as if I were an addict being monitored. As if my laptop had this little alarms that would go off in somebody's basement the moment I type her name. Nobody cares. Nobody is looking or monitoring. It isn't something forbidden. I can think of her, remember her, feel whatever I feel. I am allow to miss her.

Her last post was a meme, a reaction when' post with the face of the little mermaid. "When I want to buy converse and my mum tells me I should get some for work instead". I can't remember the number, she hadn't got to the hundred likes yet. Her boyfriend sure commented something. Would she ever see my posts this way? With Catherine's like and corny comment?

It wasn't the post, nor the likes nor the comments. It wasn't the pictures of her with her friends in Magic Mountain. It wasn't the cheesy long post of her friendships or the dedicated picture to her best friend.

Well, it was a little the picture of her friends. The fun that irradiates from their faces.

She has a job and she has friends. She went on a trip. I am in room, lonely as fuck without a job. I haven't sent the resume. I haven't waited for phone calls.

I'm just waiting. Waiting this week. Waiting to do the paperwork for the license, waiting to go to Tecate. Will I post a picture from there, smiling with whatever they give me to post it on Facebook and a stupid and cheesy "thank you" letter to all my friends and family?

Would she like it? I wouldn't get a hundred likes, but they would be several. And yet, so what? I may have three hundred friends on facebook. I may know people in more countries than the numbers on my fingers. And yet, so what? How many of those hundreds or those around the world really know me?

The closest ones, the ones who share a house with me don't know my name. That name. My name is the one they know. They do know my name. They don't know me.

Catherine knows me. RenÃ© knows me. Lili has heard about me as Carlos has, too. Miguel, as well. Anahi knows me. And the list ends.

Chevo, Jessica and Paola know about me. They don't know the name. I haven't told it to them. Has Paola seen it? Does it matter?

There still is a mismatch between my self and my reflection. My mental image and the one I see.

Which am I? Which is real and to be known?

## 2016-02-08

One hundred.

Today I reach 100.

I remember feeling like a failure when I forgot to write that day 101 days ago. No. It was more. It was the first time that I forgot. I had like 62 days writing continuously and then it ended. I never would have imagined I would reach this. That day I just thought about the streak. The days it counted. I had lost. And so I burn the silence. I reached for Monica. Two weeks later, in Halloween, the count reached 0 again. 100 days from now.

Today I'll pick Catherine from the airport. She will be arriving alone and I'll be there to welcome her.

"You know, just not Ivan in the house" her mother told her before parting. "People will talk". If that worries her, I don't know what she will think or feel whenever she realizes people have lots of other reasons to talk about us.

Ivan won't be at her house. I am not Ivan. I will pick Catherine up, not him. I am sitting now, typing this words in the computer. Reaching 100. I took a shower and did my hair and got ready. I sent her a picture of my face and a video of my smile. She'll arrive in two hours and a half. Miguel might arrive in two hours. Will he see me? Am I afraid?

If everyone knew about me I wouldn't have to be nervous. I wouldn't be hiding because I wouldn't be scared. There would be no reason to be afraid. I fear their reaction. I fear not knowing what will happen. Whenever they know, whatever will happened have had happened already.

When I think like that, it's so obvious. Why don't I tell it already? Why do I have to keep waiting and suffering?

It would be easier telling and not showing. Letting them know by my words and not my image. Let them imagine me how would I look and then showing them how I do.

I lost Monica after a trip. Is that why I am a little nervous of Catherine's arrival? Monica wouldn't let me pick her up. Monica wouldn't let me do a lot of things. No, did she ever forbid me something?

I don't want to think about Monica. I don't want to remember her.

The last idea I had of telling my father consisted in writing it and showing it.

"I have to tell you something but I can't find in my neither the words nor the courage to say it aloud."

I thought about that message that is still written inside my telephone. The one which starts "I want to tell you something, not because I have to, but because I want". I wrote it to 'everyone'. I wrote it as a manifesto, a shout to the world. It was really the message that I can't tell my dad.

And then I continued to elaborate the thought. What else could I write? I wouldn't want to do it with a long letter. I wouldn't be able to contain myself in my own skin while he reads the words from whichever screen I use. It has to be short. A paragraph, a couple of sentences.

He knows about people like me. It's a theme of current conversations in today's situation. There are jokes in Saturday Night Live, there are characters in tv shows, celebrities in reality tv families, new politics about our bathrooms and healthcare.

I don't think I have to explain what the word means. I will, though, have to explain how it applies to me. It won't be what trans is, it will be why am I one.

What if he doesn't believe me? What if he doesn't support it? It's not a decision. I don't need his money or his favors. No. I do need his money, but more than that, I need his care, his love.

"I want to tell you something but I can't find the words or the courage to say it aloud. I'm sorry for not saying it before, Dad. I am depressed. I am depressed because I don't like my body. Because I am not a man even though I look like one. I am transgender."


Would he be surprised? Would he hug me? Would he cry or be angry? He will go to Tecate to see my award. Should I do it before or after?

Should I use my phone or my computer?

Should I think in other way or should I just do it?

## 2016-02-09

"Have you chosen your suit already?" "Or a dress?" "Do you know how will you do your hair?" "Will you just tie it up? - Leave him, alone".

It's weird seeing red all of a sudden. The color of this word. Did I just change it yesterday? The 101st day will be in a new color.

Yesterday I went to pick Catherine up. "Oh, you already wrote your words? But I wanted to be on them!". She arrived late. I stepped out of the house a couple of minutes shy of three. I was wearing make up. I had the blue t-shirt over the jeggings. My lips were red and my eyes colored. I sent her a picture and then a video. I saw the video later. I replayed it at night. It's a three second clip of my looking at the camera and then smiling. The smile fades and I lift one brow after my eyes return to their normal size. Those contractions around the eyes everyone learns about trying to find the secret body language of happiness. "The true signal of a real smile".

I am happy. I am pretty. I am a girl. At least I look happy, at least I look like a girl.

Dressed and looking like that I went to buy gas. "Welcome" the clerk said. I saw in the other pump a familiar face, the one from last time. They meet maybe a hundred people every day. Why would they remember me? I avoided him anyway. Was his welcome masculine or feminine? Did I notice? I think I heard him say she. Maybe.

I spoke with a high tone but a low volume. Maybe he didn't hear me and deduce the amount from the bill I gave him. He grabbed a piece of cloth and dusted my car. Nobody had ever done that before.

From there I drove to the cake. Would I buy the one with different flavors or the coffee one? A senior lady with her, I assume, grand kid were picking a cake. They were looking at the big version of the one I had picked. The lady couldn't read the little letters so she asked the boy. A helper approached them and offered help. She ended up picking a different cake and the small one I was waiting them for. I picked the coffee one. I asked the lady for help and she picked it. Did any of them look at me funny? The kid kept turning towards me. Did he notice something?

I waited for Catherine in the airport. I was early. 10 minutes before the ETA. I knew her plane would be late. She arrived at 4:15. I took her home. After we went for food. Teriyaki and Yakimeshi. Her uncle would open us. He would see me. Didn't I care? I had forgotten. I thought she was kidding. I cleaned my lips. He called me boy, several times. I might have not noticed.

We had sex in her room. I finished twice.

Today she was going to see the doctor. She ended up deciding to go later than she was planning. I still woke up even after she finish her consult. She would be coming here. I had to shower. I did. She came a little after I had did my hair. I didn't wore a bra today. I wore just a t-shirt. Not even a shirt. I felt naked most of the day. Jhonny and Diana told me I look skinnier. Jhonny did. I said thanks. I might be in love. Or lack of sex.

The first thing we did in Uabc was meeting with Claudia. I had taken the dollars and putted them in Catherine's wallet. It ended in my purse by accident. Bag. My bag. It's not a purse.

I didn't realize they were two bills of 20. Or maybe I did, and foolishly thought that were enough. After there, we went to the main office. I did line for the certificate and then we paid the credential of students.

We bought, Catherine paid, for a wrap and fries. We shared it. We ate in the faculty, like old times. I proposed going drinking a clamato with a beer. We could go to a place, or the pub, I knew they sell it sometimes. And so we did. We could wait for jhonny there. And so we did.

Diana and jhonny won't be graduating until this semester. Do I envy them? Would I prefer still being in school or is it the idea of having more time?

I accompanied Catherine buying her groceries. It was nice, walking through picking food. Thinking what we could eat or prepare. As if we lived together. As if we could.

We can. Why couldn't why? Why did I like the idea of trip to Vegas then? It was in March. It would be even after graduation, another delay to finding a job. More time.

Tomorrow we will see Paola.

Yesterday I told Paola. Did I write about that, too?

## 2016-02-10

"She is Sofia"

I told Paola.

"Don't rehearse it." "You don't say it like that!"

I wore Catherine's jeans and the blue t-shirt. I was supposed to wake up early. Maybe I could go with Catherine to the university. I could accompany her. Then we could go to therapy, from there do something before picking up Anahi and then, finally, meeting with Paola.

I was in bed when Catherine sent me the text message that she almost was at the school. Maybe she could come home. We could do something here and going to my therapy. I'd wake up just to open her the door. I postponed the alarm and went back to sleep. I know I dreamed something with a costume. It was something black and red. It was a woman's costume. I remember comparing it mentally with the Harry Potter one. The Hermione one.

I could had mentioned that costume to Paola when we were talking about her son and the letter she would give him when he turns 11. "Did you know? We dressed as Harry and Hermione in Halloween."

Other opportunity was when she told us "I saw the Danish Girl" "Did you like it?"
But no. At some point I actually thought I would not say it today. The day would end and I would not say it. I would feel like with the contact lenses. A useless piece of no-person. If I could not her, how the hell would I tell my dad?

I dressed and put make up on. Catherine sent me another message saying she would not come. It made no sense. By the time she got here, I would already had to go to my therapy.

So I got ready and left. I looked just like monday. I was fine. I checked countless times in the reflections. People saw me. Kids, their parents. Passers-by would turn sometimes. I felt noticed, looked. I felt nervous and exposed.

When I got there, I sat and waited. I was Rene's only patient. "I wonder why nobody came." He let out non-chalantly. I am almost sure I misheard him.

We talked about Catherine's thing with Vania. How she doesn't know yet. The conversation with Jhonny and Diana.

"And you have what you'll wear?" She didn't know yet. I hadn't let out a word yet.

I don't worry about a job or an interview. I worry about being interviewed for the visa, I worry about what my family will talk about. What will they say about me?

Will there be a way to change my school papers?

From there I walked towards my car. I always avoid the reflection before entering the building. Today I used it to feel better about myself. That reflection was better than the mental image I had about me.

I drove myself to Catherine's home. She was waiting in the terrace. She waved me back when I saluted her. She made spaghetti and chicken. Her dog welcomed me. She doesn't bark at me anymore. I actually care for that dog. I worry now about her old age. What will happen when she passes away?

Today I masturbated in the shower. I pulled my own dick like I used to do it when I was a teenage boy experimenting with his junk. When I actually was scared of ejaculating. I remember thinking I had discovered my own cure to erectile dysfunction. I turned myself a little cleaning myself. I can't remember the last time I actually finished in the shower. I could not moan and scream. If I hear the next door lady and her kids talk, they sure did hear me pleasuring myself.

I can't picture that woman's face? Could she picture mine? Does she know who I am? Has she seen me? Or the other me?

After eating we went upstairs to watch an episode of Jessica Jones. We ended having sex instead.

I drove to pick Anahi up. We would meet with her outside her therapy. She looked pretty. She had a red lipstick, darker than the pencil I used today. I cleaned, no, Catherine's kisses did it. I just didn't reapply it.

After walking, and crying and walking again and sweating in the car I could see shadow in my face with Catherine. I asked her and she told me the truth. "Yes, not much, but it can be seen a little". I was disgusted. When I shaved today I accidentally dropped the razor and I guess the razor blade moved and it cut me.

I couldn't shave as close as other times. And yet it was noticeable. I would look like a man.

When I went to her bathroom to reapply make up I saw my face and liked what I saw. I looked fine. Why do I keep thinking I don't?

Even when she asked the question I was waiting for: "How do I call you?"

I gave the same moronic speech of why I am not comfortable. Why couldn't I just say it? "Yes, thank you, call me Sofia."

At least I did say the name. I said, though what I told Rene. "Call me how I look." That way, when they call me by the feminine form I'll know I look like a woman.

Although, with that phrase, when they don't, it will hurt me even more.



## 2016-02-11

Tomorrow I'll go to Tecate. It's the last city which we haven't gone together. I've already visited in, what was it, new year's? It was when my uncle asked us to pick a couple of bottles of wine for him from a friend of his. Tomorrow Catherine will pick me up from home and will drive us to school. There will be a bus waiting for us. We will see Hilda, too. Miguel, also. They will give us an award for our results in the test. My father will go, too. He will be looking for me. He'll be there and see how they recognize me. They say out loud the name my parents put on me and I'll stand and walk and shake some hands and receive something. Paolas know about me but my parents don't. They know how I feel and how I'm called. Chevo and Jessica have seen me in make up and dressed. My parents don't.

Luis might intuit something. He touched my back and open my drawer. He might have seen my bras or my mascara.

How easy is for me now compared to a year ago to write those words. I remember cringing and actually hurting thinking and typing those words. Cross-dresser, transgender, girl, woman, bra, dresses. Make up. Faggot, tranny. Even those which I still hate I can type them and say them out-loud. They've lost their power over me. I'm not scared of them anymore.

I'm still terrified of saying them about me, though. I hesitated and tumbled after I said the nuclear sentence. "I am trans." After that I was lost. How could I explain it? With which words could I illustrate the way I feel? I don't "feel" like a woman. It's not a delusion. It's not that I really think "god made mistake". I'm not anyone trapped inside any body. This is my body, I am who I am.

I want to be me. I want to look like I want, and dress how I want. I don't want to disguise or impersonate as anybody.

But I want to be seen and recognized. And at the same time I want to distance myself from the person people have seen me as this many years. I don't want to be the person they expected me to become.

"How do I call you? ... I thought something like 'Ivana'". I was repulsed without even noticing. I made a face and waved my head. "No, ok". She was trying to understand. She was the first one to ask me. To ask me just as I told them. Anahi was the first one to ask me after I thanked her for calling me, treating me as a woman. Paola did it too when I mentioned the name. This Paola was the first thing she said, she asked or wondered. She didn't thank me, nor say she would support me, nor tell me she'd be by my side no matter what. She just wondered how she'd call me. How do I want to be called. She tried to understand.

After saying it, I realized I'm not even close to being ready to tell my dad. I might be able to tell Luis. He opened up to me again. "I don't feel like I feel in my classroom". It was uncalled for. I didn't ask him anything. From nothing the comment was born. He just wanted to share how he felt. With me. He said it and I asked why. He's the most serious kid in his class.

I was the most serious kid in mine. Everyone would always describe me with that adjective. Whether or not people already saw me as an intelligent kid, I was a serious one first. I would not play loudly nor be aggressive. I would not make jokes, I would be calm and still, quiet. I would be like the poster child of the expression "children are meant to be seen not heard". Even in Spain, Consuela would be exasperated by my not talking. "You never say anything, tio".

Now I can't talk even though I want to.

In the way to Catherine's home I opened up about the introyected belief of never accepting what people offer to us. My grandma taught my mom to don't accept anything. If she wanted water or anything she could get it home.

When Paola offered us drinks, I hesitated. Just like when Monica's mom would offer me anything years ago.

Like that, I realized the theme of the insight. "That's why it's hard for me to ask for anything."

Like for instance, take anybody's initiative to ask me how I want to be called. In my mind it's still impossible to ask to be called Sofia because to me it's impossible to be seen like her.



## 2016-02-12

"Did you see the whole conversation?... 'Sophie: baby steps'. "

I could wake up fine. I think not even the first alarm blared. I opened my eyes minutes before 6 and awaited until time came. Someone was in the shower before the second alarm just approaching the first quarter of the hour. Was Catherine or I the one who started the conversation? I got up and went to see. Miguel was buttoning on his shirt. My father was the one taking a shower. I thought he was the one who always got ready first before waking up Miguel. It was better this way. Now I'd be sure he'd finish any moment. I left the clothes and the towel in the white handle of the stairs. When he exited the room he was actually looking for me as I met him there. I had time for everything. I could sat in the toilet, shower, brush my teeth, even shave normally. It wasn't rushed nor half-done. Three passes calmly. Not as close as other times, but just enough. No, almost enough. I had black spots screaming all day.

"Congratulations, young man". Even wearing a tie and formal attire, even though all those pictures, it was a nice day.

"Are you nervous?" "Not nervous, uncomfortable" She understood. Of course she did.

She picked me up after Luis and my mom had left. I was playing the city simulation app in my phone so I missed her last two messages. She called me and I went out. There were no q-tips. We weren't late but we didn't have time to waste.

We got there just fine. We parked where they told us we could. They gave us "a little lunch". A brown paper bag with a bag of chips, a granola and a juice box. The trip was a little less than an hour. When we got there. I registered and waited with Catherine. There were beverages and tapas. I was anxious and uneasy inside the theater. I was surrounded by my classmates from both generations. Hilda, Ramon, Ana Karen, Patricia, Andrea. We were the awarded ones. They were talking and chatting. I felt as if my ears where underwater. At first I conversed with Andrea but her voice was empty, baffled, muted. I nodded and smiled but my leg was restless. When we got separated by their attempt of organization I felt a pulse of relief followed by a fog of sadness and loneliness.

"Will they give us a trip?" Hilda would ask me after meeting a minutes before entering. Samantha told me she was the only one who got three overachieving from her generation. From ours it was only you, me and Anna. Will they? It could be an opportunity to another trip with Catherine. It would mean so much to me. Being prized a trip to the capital, to my city of destiny. By my merits they would actually take me to where I want to go. To where I can be me and find my future.

Even if they don't, I will go there.

I was in the theater without a phone. It was inside Catherine's purse. Catherine was texting with my dad. He was already there. Both of them would be some of the last people to enter. When they enter we wouldn't even be already seated. I found them before they saw me.

They took pictures. They saw me, they might had clapped. They saw me walking and thanking and hand-shaking and smiling double up there in those big screens. All of it is recorded in Catherine's iPhone. One of the list times they will call this name.

Was it my imagination when the master of ceremony was naming us and checked twice at me when he saw my name in the list and me standing in front of the line. It must have been.

It would not be impossible to them to reaffirm because of the doubt. "Gentleman, sir, young man": "Look, I know what you are. I got you. You don't deceive me".

Catherine picked her parents from her airport. From there we went to the movies. There was a young kid with his mom behind us in line. The theaters were almost full. We bought or seats and went to eat. A hot dog and chicken taquitoes. A big thai tea with milk and a bottle of beer.

We saw the movie and she brought me home.

It was in the parking lot. I saw her phone and her conversations. The last one from Paola caught my attention. "It was even nice to see him!".

Was it me she was talking about? I opened and was even more surprised by the message. She met Garab near her therapist. Just as we were talking about him. "Did you see the whole conversation?" Why was she upset? I showed it to her. It wasn't my intention. I wasn't snooping. Of course I saw nothing.

She covered her phone and looked at something. And then she saw me the picture from the conversation. A screencap of a list of contacts. My picture and a nickname.

Why would you send her the picture of her contacts? Yeah, you have me as... No, you have me as Sofia. That means... oh...
"Now I officially have you in my contact list."



## 2016-02-13

I was in bed when the idea struck me. There will be a congress in Sinaloa, Mazatlan. A "national" congress of psychology. I saw the names of the conferences and they were simple stuff. Nothing new. Again, the same about autism and children. The role of schools and teacher. There was one that caught my attention, maybe the only one I would actually be tempted to attend. "I accept myself, others accept me - sexual diversity" It's almost sure that it would be presented by someone who barely knows what they're talking about. A so called "expert" like my teacher of Sexuality in college.

"There are no experts here... You could be the first."

If I'd know more than that person, why couldn't I just do the conference myself? What impedes me from making it, take together all the papers I've gathered and do a half-hour conference of what is and isn't gender dysphoria. The changes that came with the release of the ignored DSM 5. Is it or not a mental disorder? How can it be treated? What should the health practitioners do when they meet with patients or clients like them... like me.

One thing led to another. The couple of students when to some country in south america to a congress of social psychology. They did a reasearch. I still have the plan of mine. I could do a form in internet and share the link. A survey of the attitudes towards transgender people. What do health students feel about transgender clients? Would doctors see them as mentally ill? Would they deny them treatment? Would they refer them to a psychiatrist with the intention of transition or to take the delusion away?

Would psych students see them as mentally ill? Would they treat the dysphoria even though it weren't the cause of consult? Would they propose, support or try to dissuade transition?

What would school teachers do when a student comes to them with these issues? Would they punish a boy for wanting to wear the girls' uniform? Would they make him cut his hair?

Would all of them let them use the bathroom they prefer? Would they deny their identity? Respect their names?

I thought about all those things. What instruments could I do? Could I make just one for everyone? Maybe I could draft different versions depending of the sample on which they'd be applied. One to medical professionals, one to psychotherapist professionals. These would have questions of experience and attitudes, personal and professional. I thought about other one to both students of medicine and psychology. And there could be a third version towards teachers or administrative staff on primary schools.

In bed I thought about the samples. Could I apply them in elementary schools? Making appointments with the principals and talking about the proposal of the study. I could make a list of all the schools in the different zones of the city and make a random sample with them. I could take the list of professors from the university and use that to do the sampling. I could go to the biggest universities or just the faculties of medicine of the UABC in the whole state.

Will I make them in paper and pencil? I could make an online survey and send it towards the professionals by email.

Gathering the results, the analysis would be the easiest part. Comply the data base and just analyze it. See what results from there.

And just then I could think of myself. Why would I want to do that? Yeah, I could ask for help and write a paper. Publish it somewhere and it would help me for my career. But is that the reason? Do I want to do a conference with the results? Do I really want to be an "expert in gender issues"?

Or do I just want to know what will the professors or doctors think about me? What will society say about me? What will my colleagues think and feel?

I would not dare give the survey to Rene. "Have to treat a patient like this?" "Would you refer them or treat them yourself?" "Would you support transition?" "Would you try to dissuade them?"

Am I scared of the results? Why don't I want to know?

Why isn't the sample of the study society itself or parents and family? Why don't I apply the focus of the study to the transgender population instead?

I don't care about knowing about me. I want to know what will everybody else think and feel about me.

"Shy the girl... oh yeah, she didn't want to see the dad, but the daughter?"

I heard the sound of the door opening and closing. Both when my dad left and returned. I was awake when I heard the sound of the bags. My mother came down and the voice of Luis entered my room. Why didn't I step out? I wasn't hungry. I waited. "Nobody is up yet?" My father had bought birria.

Anahi asked me if I'd see Catherine today. Just now, writing these words, the thought of Monica popped up. Her ghost standing behind me and picking my shoulder, just as she hated to be done unto her. Laughing, teasing. I remembered how years before... No, we didn't send messages or gifts. Did we celebrate this day? Last year she was in France. Last year I fucked with Catherine in a cheap motel downtown. The year before that I was in Spain. What did I do?

Valentine's day. Anahi sent me something and congratulate me. That was when she asked me if I'd see Catherine. She didn't want to do anything today because all of her friends were in a relationship. She demanded we went out.

Yesterday I asked Catherine that we wouldn't. I felt ill. I felt sad.

My mother published several pictures and posts about my award. Pictures of me with my dad, even with Catherine. Countless likes and comments congratulating me. Both me and my parents. That made Catherine feel something. She didn't like that. "The shared effort". Congratulating her son. Both mother and son. A shirt and tie. They called my name and I was handed the diploma. They shook my hand and congratulated me as Ivan, just as Rene said they would. Whenever he would warn me, I'd hear him as if it were something stupid. Of course. Of course they would say that name. I would never ask them to call me differently. But then, me, there, starting to walk when they say that. Knowing I'm seen as I've always been seen before.

I don't follow Monica anymore. None of her posts nor pictures appear on my screen. I have to actively and purposely look for them. I don't know what she did today. I don't if or where she went. I should not care. Until now I had not given a single thought to it. Now I imagine her and her boyfriend sitting in the movies like that day in November.

I was irritated even by the picture of Eusebio and Jessica. What was it with them that upsets me? Do I resent Jessica for her comment the last time we saw each other? "I don't know what is it, but I don't seem to flow with you". I felt, betrayed? No. I felt pressure. I had to entertain her?

Was I angry? Was I disappointed? Was I feeling guilt?

 Why do I feel tempted to look for her now? So what... she went out to see Deadpool with him, how will I feel? She went nowhere, does it make a difference?

I know now for sure that there will be a trip to receive another award. The real one now. Given to the people who get the greatest score on all the areas. Hilda will go, too. I started typing a message telling her but I deleted it. It's late. That's not what I want to tell her. That's not really what I want her to know. She's not even my friend.

Now I'm thinking of Melissa. Is she working with Ahmed? Does she have a job, too, like everybody else? Do I want to know? Do I want to talk with her and ask her? Why would I want any of them to know? What difference would it make? I would gain not a single advantage from their knowing. Not like with my dad or brothers.

The date of the award and potential trip is near May and June. A month after April. I have to dismiss that reason for keep avoiding looking for a job. Why does the idea scare me?

Catherine sent me a message. It was true when I told her I felt like crying.

I love you, I adore you, I want you, Sofia. You are my friend, my girlfriend, my pretty girl. I like every part of our story, the sad, confusing, stressful ones, because they make me enjoy even more the funny, caring, cute and calm ones. I love you for who you are. I don't care if there are days that you dress like a boy and others like a girl. I like you, Sofia. You know that it doesn't have to be Valentine's for me to tell you these things. But I can use it as an excuse to say it again. I love you, I adore you, my girl.



## 2016-02-15

Now I do think about it. It's like this silly fantasize which I am embarrassed to admit. I'm there with you, and we're both standing in front of each other. We both look beautiful in our dresses and we're both smiling and happy, around us are the people close to us, the ones who always knew since the beginning and those who went learning it as time went by. People who accept us and love us. People who've seen our growing.

We kissed as equals, as brides, as lovers. We're united and we're going to share a life, a future. I am no longer afraid because I'll have you by my side. I am no longer scared because I will never be alone. With you I can conquer my future. Together, the world is ours.

I do. Of course, Catherine, I do.


We talked about this. It swapped between us. I was sure to tell everyone that I would not marry. Why should I? Why would I? No. Marriage is not for me. I don't want a wife. I will never want to be anyone's husband. Denying it was giving power to myself, to my decision.

Now, I don't see that way. I love the idea of it being a secret. Not because I don't want anyone to know, but because I don't need to. It's our thing, it's our intimacy.

I will do it, I want it. I want its benefits. Legal and social ones. I want to be able to receive a job proposal and take her with me. I want to be able to accompany her wherever she goes. I want to live in the United States with her.

I woke up early. I was going to wear a t-shirt and a hoodie. I changed my mind and put a whole different outfit. The first androgynous shirt I bought. The red long shirt, thin with squares. I paired it with the skinny jeans and gray sneakers. I put make up and saw myself in the mirror. I took a picture of my new shaded glasses and sent it to Anahi.

"I have now a pair of sunglasses!". She would answer me back later.

The moment I woke up, I felt like I always do. I felt this disassociation. I expected to be surprised by the difference between my own self-image and the reflection that would meet me in the mirror. One a girl and one a boy. Different. Mutant, changed. Abnormal.

I met the reflection and was, in fact, surprised. My hair was tied and my skin pale. My eyes seemed wide and open. I looked feminine. If a couple of months ago I'd see that reflection as a picture of my picture self. I would believe I had started hormones. I see my own face changed. I hadn't shaved nor combed my hair. I was just out of bed.

There are not just those two things anymore. The distance doesn't lie anymore between how I feel and how I look. There are three different faces. How I feel, how I look and how I expect to be seen.

Does it surprises me when we're welcomed in the feminine way?

Catherine offered to pick me up at the last minute. She arrived and I met her in the car. We got just in time. She borrowed my tweezers and cleaned her brows. The guardian of the gate stopped us just before entering. I lend her my own id to enter. They almost never ask for it anyway. Now he wanted to see both of ours. He chatted with her while I looked for Catherine's in her purse.

The first conference was about bioethics and the procedure of getting approval by the committee. The next one, was a study of the self-efficiency of teenager's parents about their ability to talk with them about sexuality. We left to eat. She drove me to the wings restaurant. The hostess received us one way, but their catchphrase of welcome at the table turned to the masculine form.

I doubted about what I heard. I didn't ask until later in the day.

Back at school we attended Yadira's conference. She mentioned us. Looked at us and called our names when introducing the collaborators. Ivan. Ivan was the name she said. Of course it was.

I went to Colef wearing a bra and long shirts. I didn't care. It was like a job. Would I do that at my own job?

The last conference was by one of the psychologists that were in the panel in Ensenada. The one who went to Vienna and Bulgaria. He's doing his post-doctoral work in a university in Paris.

I was excited, motivated. I want my future to be like that. I want my life to be like theirs.

"If you want to dedicate to research, you will have to be accustomed to dealing with rejection... You'll get tons and tons of it. The good thing is that later you won't even feel it".

Am I capable of it?

## 2016-02-16

I was just thinking about starting to send the curriculum. Initiating the search and lookout. Sending myself out there. Stop waiting for when the dr finally gives us our results. I don't know when will that be. Maybe it would be even after my own graduation. Maybe I would keep waiting and time would catch up and...
the message of Catherine brought me out of that thought. "The Dr has our results we can pick them up Wednesdays from 12 through 2."

My therapy is at 1, but I can pick them up at noon and going to my session from there. Anahi told me she would call me around that time too to confirm where we could meet. She kind of remembers where Rene consults.

It's mid-February already. Half a month and we get to March. Less than two weeks and I have the act and the party. I have two weeks to tell my parents for them to know at my grad. So I could really get over that, close that stage and phase. To start a new. After telling my family, anyone else knowing doesn't matter.

My father is the most difficult person to tell. It's whose reaction I fear the most. Whose face I can't even imagine finding me dressed in an outfit like that.

Once I dreamed going to a party in a dress and flats with a rose on their front edges. I had a phone and wondered where to put it. I was wearing a purse and it was normal. Except it wasn't. Was I thinking of my own father's reaction?

"But why are they flower patterned?"

Because I like them. Because I ordered them like this. Because I asked for women's.

Will I tell Luis now that I told Paola? It was a rehearse. It was a mock up, a trial. I failed. I realized how unprepared I am. How I can't explain it. I had to use the movie as a backstory, an example. What could I tell my own dad?

"Do you know gay people?" "Do you know any transgender person?"

Yes, no... "Why?"

Just because...

I feel like a coward and at the same time I'm angry at myself for yesterday's thoughts. I didn't deny my emotions. I took responsibility for them and acknowledge them with Catherine. I am scared of her leaving. I am scared people in the know will abandon me. A part of me still thinks that they're entitled to. They should. I was upset my Paola's reaction. Why would she ask how to call me? Why would she care for my own comfortableness?

I don't deserve their caring. They should not care. Their caring makes me feel spoiled. I should suffer. I should be antagonized and discriminated. Is that really what I want? Or is what I expect?

I'm not ready for my parents to ask me those questions. "How do we call you?"

"I'm not one of your 4 men" I wanted to tell her. Mention her in passing. Just saying. I am not. Stop.

What do I want her to say instead? My men and something else? My 3 men and a half? My men and girl?

That would be even worse.

That's the thing. Their caring and acceptance feels worse to me. I don't want to be rejected, but being accepted feels false. "How can I ask them to call me Sofia if that's not my name? My parents didn't name me that way, that name didn't accompany in my childhood. I didn't grow up with it" "How could I ask them to call me by the feminine way if I don't look the part? How can I be a she if I look and dress and sound as a he?"

Now it hurts. I don't want to be seen as Ivan. I don't want to be called that. I don't want to be seen as a man, as me, as him.

I want to wear whatever I want. I don't care about the strangers' opinion but I do care about my father's. I do care about the people who do know me. The people who still see me as Ivan no matter how close I shave or how I dress.

And like that I am stuck. I introduce myself as Ivan because I can't adopt the other name. I keep wearing those clothes because I don't care to be seen any other way. I still use this voice because of the fear of being clocked faking.

It's a commodity this limbo. It looks as if it were an accident. "Oh, my mistake, I thought you were a woman, I am sorry", instead of "You almost fooled me. I could see you for who you really are. Shame on you for hiding yourself".

I want to stop hiding anymore.

But... but, I am still scared of being seen.

## 2016-02-17

"you mentioned something just now, that: "ambiguity'"

Paolas know about me. Anahi knows. Catherine has known since the very beginning. Chevo and Jessica were the first I told and yet now they are the ones who know less.

"He has friends" "And what am I, jackass?" "My friend (feminine)". I have no male friends.

"You were going to be my best friend. I've never had one. Catherine has Miguel and you were my candidate".

Have I ever had one? Medrano could count maybe, in jr high. He thought I was crazy. I made him believe that. I remember one night when he confessed to me about stealing a pair of panties from his neighbor. I couldn't help to imagine myself in his place, empathize with him. But it wasn't the same. He stole them to masturbate, to think of her. Other time we were debating. Why would homosexual parents not have the right to adopt a kid? He told me he accepted them, but it wasn't about them. Society wasn't ready. Other kids would bully the child. It was for their best.

I disagreed. Why would they suffer from the sins of the rest? It's not their responsibility. Society is wrong, so change society.

"I defended you, Andres, I never cared that you were a faggot"

To him, he did good. His intentions were good. Would he understand me? Would he imagine it?

Alan maybe would be my best friend in the first semesters of high school. I was excited when I learned he would be in my classroom.
Would he understand? Would he care?

"If you were gay I would tolerate you, I would accept it and let you live your life. I just would stop talking to you and end the relationship". Those were the words of Israel, from first semester. I liked him. He sang sometimes and played the guitar flawlessly and full of life. I would remember him walking through the streets in Salamanca hearing the flamenco musician. "This is so spanish" Helena said when we walked from the cathedral to the library.

The second half of high school Monica was my best friend. Graduating she became my girlfriend. We were lovers. We were happy. Or so I thought.

"Time it was, and what a time it was. It was a time of innocence, a time of confidences. Long ago it must be, I have a photograph preserve your memories. They're all that's left you".

That song would play in the video I made for her while I was in Spain, missing her.

I can't remember the last time I saw that video. I think I deleted it.

I have a two hour one of the seven of us. My best friends. The closest ones to me, the ones who were with Catherine and me in the Sierra, one of them, the only male friend I have left, they don't even know my name.

"I am in the middle. I dress this way but is ambiguous. I don't show myself neither as a male or female. I don't commit. I let the responsibility to others. When they see me as a man after calling me a woman it's their mistake "Oh, I am sorry, I confused you". If I do it on purpose, if I wear a dress and full make up, it becomes my intention. My choice and responsibility. It's my fault then. "You didn't fool me. I saw who you were. You are really a boy.

"I don't want to commit until everyone sees me as a woman. If nobody questions me, then I don't have to defend myself. I am not ready to answer back whenever someone tells me "you are a man". How can I say: "no, I am not". "You have a penis, and XY chromosomes" What can I say then?

I said it before though. I almost screamed it. "I am not one of your 4 men. I am not a man!"

After school Anahi and I accompanied Catherine to see her dress. We were in the shop, that little spot in a swap meet. When Catherine stepped in to try it, Anahi asked me "Which one do you like?" "For her?" "No, for you".

How could I answer that? I've never shopped for a dress before. I've never picked one or try one of them. I've never even worn a long dress. How could I know what I like?

We kept walking and got to the bride ones.

"For the wedding" she said.

Would we wear two of those?

"Sometime we'll do the shopping and make up and all of this together".

## 2016-02-18

"You don't look like this. Do you have an id? It's ok, you gained some weight, didn't you?"

"Thank you very much... Angelica" "Sofi"


I was desperate. I couldn't take it anymore. Yesterday I was Ivan again. It was too much. Even Catherine slipped several times. I didn't care about the border, I didn't care about the pharmacy. I wore the sweater and make up. I even wore it before crossing.

In the pharmacy I asked for the happy pills in a little higher voice. The pharmacist looked at the prescription and said nothing about the name. "The bottle has 14 pills" "Give me 2" I whispered and raised two fingers to confirm silently. She went behind the counter and took them. "They will charge you here ..." I couldn't hear what word she used. Was it son or was it daughter? How did she see me? How was I seen?

I let it go.

"Let me give you a hug because I won't be seeing you this often." Liliana told Catherine about the different projects she has. She offers them to her own patients because she knows them. To external people, like me, she interviews them to see their aptitudes and skills. So later we might accord a meeting.

When we left the consult Catherine confessed to me how she could see some shadow on my upper lip. Was I ok? Was it fine telling me?

I was going to mask it after the pharmacy, but there was no point. Why should I? I'd cross the border and be interviewed by the border patrol. Instead I cleaned the red of my lips.

There was a short wait. We waited less than half an hour outside the offices. Then Catherine passed to the booth. "Do you speak Spanish? How do you say 'I like you'?" "Me gustas" "Thanks!" and high-fived her. I was called by the facing officer with a motion of his wrist.

I was unrecognized.

Until later I would think about it. How many cards do they read an hour, a day? Do they look at the info or just at the picture? Did he give up when he noticed the 'male' part? What was the point in another id? I am a man. That was the dissonance between the pic and reality.

He let me pass and I was still scared.

We were driving towards Liliana when I got lost in thoughts: "Is it illegal to carry a taser?"

"What would you expect me to do if someone said an insult or made a face or something? What would you do?"

I have reasons to be scared. That's the danger of leaving the ambiguity. That's the danger of leaving and living.

I didn't colored my lips again. Catherine would hide the shadow but after eating. First we walked to the adults' school. I waited outside the office. I sat in a bench looking at my reflection. Several people passed by and saw me. A girl smiled. What do they see?

Why do I care? What difference does it make?

I entered the bathroom again. I sat in the cubicle next to Catherine. My penis never looks or feels as big as when I seat in a toilet seat where no penis should be.

We ate in the in'n'out. Catherine ordered. We ate outside. We talked about Monica. "What did you feel when we told you yesterday that you were fixated on Monica?"

Catherine is not Monica. She doesn't replaces her, because she doesn't need to. I like Catherine. I like being with her. "You're my first real relationship" "Monica was your first everything"

Monica taught me what love feels like. Now, with Catherine, this is something different. It feels different. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't scar. It lifts me instead of drowning me. It makes me want to get up and live instead of hide and die.

But it's not a comparison. I never wanted Monica. I wanted to be her. That wasn't fair. That wasn't right.

We boarded the trolley again and got out in Palomar. Target. We looked in the feminine section. Clothes, blouses, dresses. I didn't find anything. Was I really looking? There were no purses that I liked either. I had more than 50 dollars in my wallet but now the need of spending them wasn't there. It was fine that there were nothing. We saw the underwear and I bought a bra.

A blue, wireless bra. Like the one Monica gave to me. Smaller than the rest I own. Monica's size, actually.

People saw me. Catherine gave the sweatshirt that her parents bought me. I changed the girl's sweater to it.

The day wasn't fulfilled until a person addressed us as ladies.

I wasn't seen until I confirmed that somebody really saw me.

## 2016-02-19

My head hurts. I have a headache. What's the difference between those two statements?
In one I separate my head as in a part of my body from myself. The head hurts. It's a separate entity from me and the whole action that causes discomfort is caused and effected on it. In the second, I take responsibility for my pain. I see myself as a whole entity, a complete system.

5 years ago if I'd read this, would it be enough to convince me that I already am a psychologist?

I am not a psychologist. I have no doctorate. I have a bachelor's. I don't even have a certificate of profession. I haven't walked in black robe with that silly hat.

I'll graduate and leave this person behind.

"Have you thunk about telling Luis?" No. I won't tell him nor my parents again until after graduation. I hesitated about telling them before my birthday. How awkward would it be for them to know and be with me? The graduation is supposed to be a party, celebrate my accomplishment, what I've finished. They can celebrate it, have a last nice memory of their son.

I think about it as I'm writing this. Rene's hesitation was subtle. It was a passive idea thrown in silence. How different would it be if I were with another therapist?

Writing about it, projecting my own hesitation in the well-being of others, denying my own fear and anxiety using them as an excuse. "Is it really for them that you have not told them yet?". Is it really that bad them knowing who their child really is and accompanying you, knowing you? Wouldn't it be a great time for them to know, celebrate who you've been and celebrating the future that awaits you?

That sounds so humanistic that even me from 2 years ago would have been surprised to know I said it. Is what Lilliana would tell me or what would I say to me as a patient?

I have the contact of Liliana to concert a meeting to talk about the project. Rene told me, assured me that nothing impeded me to introduce myself to my patient as the psychologist Sofia. It I didn't sound nor looked as a woman, if whomever I would attend questioned my gender it had nothing to do with the process.

Why does it still scares me, though? Even contacting Liliana makes me nervous. Introducing myself to her again. "I'm Sofia, Catherine's girlfriend". And then should I present myself to her dressed feminine? And then introducing her contact femininely? And then going to the course or the session in make up and a blouse?

Where would I draw the line? Liliana knows me and has seen me. The contact doesn't know me yet. He has a blank idea of who I am. And then, the people with whom I'd work, the ones who could accept me or reject me.

What would it mean going to work as Sofia? Does it excites me or scares me?

Would I really get to the point to changing after leaving the house and before returning? Would I introduce myself to strangers before even to my own family?

I already did that.

"Angelica" "...Sofi"

Did she believe me?

Does it matter?

I still have a headache. I woke up early in the morning with Luis and my mother's voices. His egg broke. Something. I don't care. I had trouble falling asleep again. I finished the Utena series and then watched the movie.

Somebody from the elections institute came to notify Miguel he was elected to work as a functionary. My father too.

I did some laundry. I finished with my underwear and whites. The blue bra that I bought yesterday is still in my bag with the etiquette.

Catherine went to the doctor. She will have a surgery in her lower back. She's numb but scared. She's pressured by the time. As I am.
She has the invitations to the graduation. Two more weeks and all of this will be over. I would have graduated and finished my life as a student. No more suit, no more parties.

No. There will still be parties and suits. This is the last known event that I will have to attend. But what if somebody dies or even Luis' graduation a couple of months from now. I will have to wear something to it. I will be seen as his older brother.

Or will I? He will be graduating in July. I have my appointment in April. My parents have to know before my appointment. I can't deal with this on my own.

It feels as if I did something wrong. As if I did it behind their backs and I should confess a crime. Is that another reason why I am scared?

## 2016-02-20

The graduation is close. I told my parents I have almost everything for the process of the license. I just have to pay for the honorific mention and buy two or three tickets for the raffle. Yesterday, was it yesterday?, I saw again the job postulation asking for someone to contact and treat the patients. Register their treatment and process. I am a perfect fit for it. They haven't filled the position in one month. There must not be a lot of competition. It was new, less than a day of age.

I didn't apply. What of it scares me? That they'll ask me to wear a uniform? They'll ask me to cut my hair? They might ask me to ... There will be people with whom I'll have to socialize. In every job that's something that I'll need.

I looked about the people the Colef sponsors. Their jobs are given to students of bachelors or master. I have to be a student to be considered. So that closes that option.

There are job offerings looking for interns but those places are not paid. Am I scared? Why didn't I send the resume? Why does the idea of them calling me makes me nervous? The possibility of hiring me scares me. That's what I want, that's what I need.

Everyone has their job and position and something to do. I am lost.

What if my job impedes me to continue changing?

I have said that I'll wait after the graduation. I'll apply to almost everything that I can apply to after that. But what if I move the goalpost again after I reach it? I said I wouldn't look until new year's eve, then it was something else. Now is the graduation. Will the next one be the meeting with the endocrinologist?


It irritates me. It's frustrating. I feel impotent and useless.

I feel lonely again.

I used to wake up and distract myself with that weird anime of Utena and the duels in that school. The feminist anime full of symbolism. I ended it yesterday. Today I watched a movie about a comedian who gets pregnant and has an abortion.

I broke fast in the morning and returned to bed. Like those other days. I haven't showered since thursday. I can smell myself. I haven't shaved either since then. I should do it after finishing this. Maybe that will help me feel better. Cleaner. Spotless.

It's the weekend will somebody even see my resume? Will I be contacted? The last job I applied to didn't even called me back for a meeting.

I just need something until I can go and apply for the master. I have the project of Catherine's old therapist. I could talk about sexuality or attend patients. With a patient I would receive money. With the shops maybe I won't.

I have to contact her, too.

Anahi and Catherine made plans for next week. We could go to the beach Tuesday. It was accorded. We would meet then. I turned the phone and went back to bed. It will be hot those days. What if I would wear dress? Would I dare? Being out with them.

It's too soon. I'm rushing myself. Someone will react badly. I may be confronted or harassed. Am I not scared?

I could wear shorts and a blouse. Would I really? What is it with me and doing that? Doesn't it hurt?

No. It hurts not doing it. It hurts waking up and staying home all day. It hurts spending another day as Ivan. But dressing up and going outside is not the solution. They're just clothes. I am the same person. My beard still grows and my penis still hangs.

I feel lonely and I feel useless. What use does being a psychologist give me? What benefits do I get with going to Tecate to receive an award for my test results?

What's the point of having more than three hundred contacts in Facebook if I don't dare to publish the pictures I like?

Why don't I post them? Because people will see them. Isn't that the whole point of sharing them? Showing them?

What happens with them seeing them? They will know. They will see me. They will question me. They will talk.

They will know my secret. No. They will see them, will see me. They won't know a thing. It's just pictures. They will question or comment. They might laugh.

Am I scared of them laughing at what I like? Am I scared of people taking them away from me?

Am I scared of them not reacting? To them seeing them like a normal picture. Seeing Ivan in them.

## 2016-02-21

"I don't want to talk right now. Can we chat in the evening?"

I sent a text message to Lilliana and my curriculum in both English and Spanish to the scantibodies place.

I opened the word file of my resume and started translating it to English. I almost finished. I thought I did. Uploaded the files and clicked send. I still had the files opened when I realized a subtitle said "Logros". If I were recruiting for that place I would discard the resume instantly unless there were no other candidates. After one month the offer is still open. Either the salary is shit or they haven't find someone who can fulfill their needs.

I am overqualified to what they are looking. They want someone with a high school degree. I have a bachelors and experience with patients. And a degree more useful to them than an administering one. But I made a mistake. I wasn't going to apply anyway. It's the same. At least I tried. Now they can ignore me and I can count them as another place I contacted.

With Lili I have a meeting tomorrow. She will ask me my contact information and I will ask her about the details of the projects. She told Catherine to ask for my info. "Her name as is in her documents". Was that what hurt the most?

It actually should had eased everything. It settled that stuff. Now I knew that I was trying as Ivan. I was meeting her as Ivan and would apply as Ivan. Because that's the name in my documents, the name everybody knows me by.

That wasn't it. It sure helped but it wasn't the main issue.

The courses about sexuality probably won't be paid. I'll receive no remuneration. It would be better for me to take the patient. Practice therapy. I'd receive payment and supervision. I can use those hours as experience in individual therapy. The worst that can happen is a teenager abandoning the process. No, they could insult me or hit me or something excessive like that. But I'm not worried about those.

It should be the obvious choice. One, two sessions a week. Half of the paid would go as rent to the office. I'd pay the supervision with that money.

The other option, probably unpaid is the one that deals with more people. Is going to high schools and talk about sexuality. Teach about genitals and getting pregnant and how not. Talking about what I know, what I researched. What I obsessed with for a while. What I'm passionate about.

But they're teenagers. They will be whole groups of them. I am scared of them, of how they might react, what they might say or do. What they might see.

I'm scared of incarcerating in a project I won't be able to do. I'm scared of setting me into more time as Ivan.

But that's what will happen when I get a job. That's will happen whatever I decide.

Is that why I sent the message and set the meeting and sent the resume even though it scares me as much to see and talk with patients in that office?

I don't know when they'll contact me or even if they will. They might not. They probably won't.

With Liliana's project is just a day a week. Little pay. Doing something with my time. Am I able? Do I know enough? Can I do a good job?

"Did you fall asleep?" says the little pop up notification with Catherine's face. I abandoned her again. "What do I choose? What availability do I have?" She kept sending me messages with answers. Just one day a week. I can pick whatever I want, sure the sex courses probably won't be paid and the therapy will be almost nothing. She chose fridays because of her english classes. Was I upset because of the name? I should contact Lili myself and give her the information. I might set an appointment with her. I should tell her how the request of the name made me feel...

I couldn't. I wanted to cry. I felt the tears forming and my fears solidifying inside, like a dark fog taking form, filling me like a balloon ready to pop. I wanted to escape. I ran away. I hid the phone under my leg and kept watching the tv. I cried two single tears that nobody saw. The only one who know was Catherine because I wrote it to her.

Do I want anyone else to know? Did I want my mother who was doing the dishes to turn and notice? Notice the tears, notice me.

They won't come if I don't invite them. They won't come after a whole life of sending them away.

I need their help.

## 2016-02-22

I dreamed with Monica once again. She sent me a text message in whatsapp. There was this weird question that surfaced as soon as I saw her name in the notification. "What's the cause?" Why would she contact me? Is it my birthday, hers? We didn't talk in new year's nor christmas. I read the message and kept wondering about that: "Why?"

Yesterday I fell asleep with that thought in my mind. Asking her. Why can't I? I told her, proposed to her, to part our ways. Let's separate until you're ready. That was more than one hundred days ago. Do I have permission to contact her and ask her that? Is that really what I want? Just to know if he saw me. Yes or no. Would I leave it there? Of course not. I would continue, "Did he ask you something?, did you tell him something?"

And then? Would that be enough? "ok, thanks" and I'd leave for a hundred more days.

Does that change anything? I looked her up last time. I contacted her and mend the bridge. She wasn't ready and I was hurt. It should end there. I should had left her there, too.

I went to Liliana's office today. Catherine went to do her test. I put on the blue bra that I bought last week. I could wear whatever the fuck I want. There would be nobody home. No. That's not true. I left home after Miguel arrived.

I showered and shaved. I did my hair and put make up on. Almost nothing, just enough to be comfortable. I was wearing gray pants and a blue and gray shirt. I went to the closet and took the gray dress that Catherine gave me. I undressed in front of the mirror and wore it. Could I leave the house like this? My bare legs, my bare arms. It felt big. The part over my chest was baggy.

I didn't look bad. But I didn't feel comfortable enough to be outside like that. I know I'd be seen as a woman. Mostly. Maybe.

No. I would have to take extra clothes anyway. I am not ready to face my parents like that. It will be a thousand times easier telling them with my words than with my clothes.

Yesterday I felt bad thinking about this ambiguity that I can't escape from. I didn't use my name when I sent Lili a text. 'I'm Catherine's partner". I let her fill the blank.

"Do I have you on whatsapp or Facebook?" "Yes" She was looking for me. She hadn't found me yet.
"Ivan Fernandez?" Several times she had called me 'son' or used male pronouns. I wasn't wearing the dress but pants and a shirt.
"I have you as Sofi" and smiled. "Do you want me to have you as Ivan or is Sofi alright?" I smiled back. I felt shy. I asked her just like I did with Rene when he offered to treat me like Sofia. I said yes and smiled and felt a combination of shyness and joy.

We talked about her different projects. Psychotherapy, groups and talks about sexuality, talks about nutrition, evaluation of people. She even offered me giving me her archive of tests for me to do an investigation with it.

My face lightened up. I was interested. I wanted to. Of course I did.

Minutes after when I was already in my car on my way home, I felt different. Sure, there were something I could do. I might even gain some money from it. Why didn't it feel enough? What was lacking?

I would be doing research she talked about the possibility of actually presenting the results. And yet it felt wrong. It felt as if it wasn't what I wanted.

I want to do research. I like tests and data analysis. I like all those sort of things.

Except that is not the research that I want to do. There are thousands and thousands of papers of psychological tests. In Mexico, in Latino America in the whole word. With groups bigger, incomparably bigger than the one that I could muster.

No one, no body is doing the research that I have in mind. There are not as many papers about people like me. There is no research nor interest.

I could present the results and they would be more valuable. To society, to the medical community, to people like me.

I have to do it. I can't let it be just an idea.

This is what I'm meant to do.

## 2016-02-23

Yesterday I thought again about the possible projects of research I could do. Would I do a personal pencil and paper survey or an online one? Could I send the form to all the psychologists in Mexico? I could use it and disperse it by Facebook by the help of the contacts I have. I could send it by email to the psychologists in the lists of psychotherapists of the different schools.

I could do a lot of things. Interviews, focal groups, surveys. I could see myself presenting the results in a congress. Speaking in front of an auditory and talking, talking about the importance of it. Seeing how surprised I was by the results, seeing myself explaining how it's so important to do something to actualize the professionals in the right way of treating the trans community. I could make a workshop, I could organize a talk. I could do lot of things.

Would I do them as a trans person myself?

Would I say it in front of a crowd, would I wear woman's clothes and change my own voice when speaking? Would I enlist my name in the paper itself? Would I be questioned by the possible bias of the study by my participation? Would people applaud? Even though I am who I am.

I want to do it with Catherine. I want to meet her and talk about this. I could actually do this research in my own school. "Health sciences" is the name of the grad program. I might get it for free if I end up being Magna Cum Lavde.

Catherine asked me last night if I could go with her to her lab tests. I declined. I would had to wake up early and go pick her up and being ready. I ended up falling asleep past 3 in the morning. She had returned home when I had just opened my eyes.

Tomorrow I have a session with Rene. I may talk about this, my meeting with Liliana and her coming and forth with her way of calling me. I might talk about going to the US and not being recognized or introducing myself to the woman of the adults' school.

This project I have is like a little stone stuck in my shoe. I keep postponing it, though. I could be reading the book I downloaded or looking up information about qualitative research or more papers about the theme. Yet I have done nothing.

Three, four times was I called today by Telcel. They're not even my phone company and they're still irritating. I have blocked several numbers of them and they're still four of 6 contacts in the most frequent screen.

After therapy we might go to the movies. I wanted to wear something girly. I want to look feminine. I don't want to be seen as Ivan. Not anymore, I don't care about the ambiguity. I care about my family. I either put on something neutral with which I can return home or wear something daring that I'll end up changing outside the house before entering home.

I can show myself to the world but not to my family. The world keeps changing. The people who might judge me won't be there later. The sight of my parents and brother's reaction is not something that time itself will wash away.

No, it will. The thing is that I have to stay here and be witness of how the adapt. I actually will know what they will think or feel.

No, that's not true either. I won't know. Even know I don't know what they do know or ignore. I don't know what they intentionally miss or try to forget.

Rene was surprised by my thinking of my mother not remembering what I told her. It's easier for me, convincing myself that it didn't happen, that she forgot. It would be easier dealing with the comments she has made.

I hate her stupid joke of asking if someone is depressed. Miguel was serious and she questioned him if he had depression. I was just beside him but resisted to turn. She might have realized or she just might had continued as an act of routine. "Post-partum depression"

Yeah. Depression is possible. Is something that wanders in the house. It's necessary to take it to the impossible, the ridicule. The joke is you can't be pregnant. Har har.

I get irritated by what they do or say and yet I can't say anything myself. What the fuck is it that impedes me to open up?

If I stay shelled in my own secrecy I will rot.

## 2016-02-24

Today there was no confirmation.

I woke up almost 12 hours ago. I was dreaming something. There was some kind of hotel, and a group of people with me waiting in the bathroom. We needed to be ready for someplace. Catherine was the first to get into the shower. She was naked and didn't mind. There was another woman who was already undressing. Could I undress too? Did I feel like a woman or a man? I knew there I had a penis. Was I thinking of it or was I only shy?

I was brushing my teeth or something. I was rinsing my mouth with something. When I spat I opened my eyes and continue the action in my own pillow. Irritated I just pushed it away from me and returned to sleep. Not a lot after I woke up again and stayed awake.

What is it with me and bathrooms in my dreams? There is always a bathroom. The need to get ready for someplace and the pressure of time. It's been my morning routine almost all of my life. Waking up, getting ready, going somewhere.

There was a conversation with Catherine and Anahi. It was Catherine's first day at school. I was out of the shower when she texted me again to tell me her teacher was organizing a trip to San Diego Zoo.

I'm writing this words with an opened bottle of beer right in front of me. My teeth are pushing and screaming. I should had taken them out almost 5 years ago. The dentist warned me that it was dangerous leaving them in. They would ache and I would have to take them out anyway sooner or later.

There has been several times when a subtle notice grabs my attention. Like a little push to remind me they're there still. They scare me and by the next day the get quiet again.

Maybe it's the alcohol or the coldness of my drink. Maybe it's like Catherine said and just because we didn't kiss enough.

After the shower I tried the blue blouse I wore in the pride. It was wrinkled and I felt weird in it. Something about my chest or shoulders. Was my face ready then or was it before I did my hair?

Today I finished the first bottle of my pills. I have to remember to buy them again.

Next week is my graduation. I don't want it again. In the movie theater I told Catherine how I hadn't thunk about Luis' graduation. It will be in July. How will I go? Will I still go as Ivan? Will I dress differently? Present differently?

"My brother has long hair" "Does he?" "Yeah, he does". Will his conservative principal look at me funny? Will I go with a suit and tie?

There is a lot of time since then. And, unlike the time before this graduation, there are a lot of things that will happen before then.

Catherine was right. I don't even know how will my parents react. How will they act to how I dress or looks. To the changes that I'll experience. Even then, I don't really know if I will be able to take hormones and have those changes.

"Can you open this for me? ... Thanks"

Does he glance this way? Is he interested in what I write in here?

I haven't written about telling him nor my dad. My graduation is coming. I said I would tell them after it.

I wore a red long-sleeved t-shirt over the jeggings. I painted my lips red. I hid my eyes under the sunglasses. I walked to therapy and got in an oxxo before my session. "Sofiaa, I need your help". Is she mocking me? Is she being polite? Is it a game to her?

Why am I getting this defensive? When I read the text I felt excited and glad. Is it the beer?

I dropped a coin when I was putting my notes in my wallet. "Oh, I found 2 pesos" said the man who gave it to me. Was he being playful? Did he see me as a woman? Did anyone?

I met Catherine in Plaza Rio. "You've looked more feminine other times. You don't look as feminine, but you don't look masculine, either. I can't pinpoint what exactly is it. You really look neutral. I'm sorry"

Did it have something to do with this feeling?

We saw Room after eating a pizza in Food garden. I was excited and motivated telling her about my research project. What I plan, what I want to do.

There was a phone conversation that lasted a significant fraction of the movie, as well as a lot more than a handful of different ringtones that rang several times along the projection.

Catherine was tired. After picking up her dress I left her home. It's her first day and she walked a lot.

I am tired, too.




## 2016-02-25

"In that one you don't look like a woman. But yo do in this one" "I'm bisexual, no, trisexual: I am a man, a woman and a swagger"

Does he know what he is talking about? I know he's playing but he makes me nervous. What if he's like me? What if me coming out actually confuses him? Did I want to tell him when I was in bed laughing at his jokes? I pointed towards the box that is in front of my books. He read what it said and didn't get it at first. "It was my valentine's gift".

He opened the box to look inside. There are two kit kats but he didn't recognize them. He thought they were really condoms.

I woke up early today. I've been awake since 7 in the morning. I opened my eyes when my mom and he were getting ready to leave. Was she screaming? In the evening when they arrived before my dad, she had no voice left. As soon as the car drove off I got up and drove to the oxxo. I bought a small ginger ale and a large bottle of lemonade. I wanted to drink something sugary since yesterday. Now, after almost a liter of soda in the whole day, I regret it.

I was in pajamas when I paid. There was a young man paying in front of me. The cashier called him "young man" like 4 times. Yesterday I shaved. I was just up. Would he see me? How many times would he say it to me? I payed. He just used it once.

I watched a movie. True story. Jonah Hill and James Franco. A journalist interviewing a man who killed his wife and children. A psychological thriller. A half an hour episode of Law and Order, like one of the reviews wrote.

Yesterday's movie was different. I didn't have much expectations. I almost asked Catherine to see another one when we met. We cried when the mother finally was rescued by the police and ran towards her son in the patrol car. I felt the anxiety of the prep for his escape. I felt the sadness of the punches the questions of the interview gave them. I felt.

How many movies have I wasted not really feeling? Is this how everybody experiences cinema? Was Whiplash the first movie I really saw? How do people like going to the movies?

I downloaded a pdf reader in my tablet. I haven't opened the statistics book I downloaded in a lot of time. Yesterday I downloaded a manual for doing research protocols from the National University of Mexico. I can use it as a guide for my project.

When I was explaining my ideas to Catherine she confessed to me how she didn't really see me going to the schools and doing the survey. Sure, I would coordinate the project and organize it, but she couldn't really see me doing the field work. I know from where she was talking about. I know myself too. This was different though. I have thunk about it. I have considered calling or sending emails and presenting myself to the principals of schools, to the teachers.

The professors and students is even more feasible.

But that's not what I remembered. Afterwards, when I asked her which one of them would she like to do, she evaded the question. Doesn't she really want to do it with me? Maybe it isn't really her thing. It's ok.

I guess.

It was weird. We chatted a little in her breaks. After returning from the US, we haven't talked much. I actually have chatted more with Anahi than with her.

I went to my parents' closet and looked for my high school grad suit. Yesterday was, I think, when I commented it to her. I thought about not wearing a tie. I imagine myself with the suit of the wedding. But it doesn't really fit. It feels wrong. I saw the first five minutes of the next show that was recording. It was... I don't remember. There was this man with a suit, a three pieces suit, but he looked casual. He wasn't wearing a tie and hist shirt was open just over his waistcoat. I remembered my grad suit. I could use it. It would fit. A graduation suit. The first and last one I use.

Before the movies I thought about Luis' grad, too.

I sent her a picture of me with it. "I felt weird when I looked at the picture ... I liked it, it looked good, but it wasn't you."

She asked me, too, if I changed my voice yesterday. It was different. I did, but not totally. Today I heard myself. I downloaded a voice analyzer and a sound recorder. At first I read a fragment of Dorian Grey in my own voice. Then, I read it changing my voice. It marks if it sounds feminine, masculine or androgynous.

Even though it marks it, even though there is a confirmation, I can't allow myself to believe it.

Why?



## 2016-02-26

I can't stop thinking about that fucking question.

"In your place, I don't think I would be wearing the clothes outside, not yet. I couldn't deal with people wondering if I'm male or female, not until I had went to the laser or started the hormones and had physical changes. Not until I blended in." Don't I blend in?" "No, you don't." "So, how I look right now, it is not enough for you?" "It isn't enough".

I feel like she lied to me. It doesn't hurt because of what she said. It hurts me because of all that she has said before. I was fooled by her double standard. I look good enough to be outside and be seen, but only because it's me. If it were her, it wouldn't be enough. I don't blend. I don't look bad, but I still grab sights. "3 in 10 people, maybe, turn and wonder what you are. It's not that you look manly. There is something in you, something weird, that makes people doubt, you know? 'is that a man? Nah, or is it?' "

I was thinking about that conversation in argana in our way home. I felt like an idiot. I doubted everyone but her. Anahi, Liliana, Paola. How could anyone use that name if I look like a man still? She was the only one whom I trusted. I could had bet that she saw me as a woman. I was a woman to her. It threw me off when I realized that I haven't changed enough.

How can I ask them, then? How can I want to be called Sofia if I haven't changed? That was the whole fucking deal. I look like a man. When they used that name or feminine pronouns when I still look like this, it's a lie. It's a favor. It's because I wanted, because I asked it. I feel like a midget being called a giant. Just because of its good intentions doesn't make it less of an ironic mocking.

That's not the question that bugs me. That's not why I opened her stupid conversation and typed again, even though it won't change a fucking thing. It'll make things worse. If she doesn't answer, it'll be about her apathy. If she answers back, it will be her coldness or her hypocrisy. If I receive the answer I want I won't believe and if it isn't, I'll hate myself for even wonder it.

And yet again, here I am still seeing her fucking ghost. I won't let her die. She's gone. Why can't I just understand it and deal with her absence. She's gone, god damn it.

She left, I cried, it hurt. It's in the past. There it belongs.

I should worry about the future. I sent another CV. This one about tutorship to adults on their classes. I don't think I'll be contacted. It doesn't matter. I tried.

Catherine saw her patient today. She started the evaluation but won't be able to continue it. Their schedules don't match. They referred her to me. I felt envy of her case and now it's on my lap. I might receive just less than 10 bucks for my work but it's something.

Liliana asked Catherine to tell me to call her. I did. How should I introduce myself? Ivan or Sofia? Who the fuck am I?

She went ahead of me and addressed me even before I could open my mouth. "Sofi, how are you?" Later she sent me the contact info of the girl, and the hypothesis that I would investigate. I just had to schedule the meeting and tell her later about it.

I called her and she answered. I hadn't think about my past patients until later. She was in class. "Can I return your call? I'm in class and it's just started."

I packed the phone in my bag and finished getting ready. I wore my red pencil subtly in my lips. I wanted to look feminine. I failed.
"Do I look more or less feminine than when we went to the movies?" I saw the worry in her eyes before her answer. "Less" she said quickly to get over it. It didn't matter, whatever, I could take it. At least it's the truth.

There I remembered about the call and checked the phone. I had a missed call about 20 minutes earlier. I sent her a text so I would not interrupt another of her classes. She hasn't answered yet. TTomorrow I will call her again. Then I started to remember and worry. What if she abandons me, too? What is it with people leaving?

There was the woman who got angry when I turned in the street besides the fish place. She didn't address me in any way. I don't know what she saw. The only one who address us was the gum seller in the bay: "Misses, would you help me buying some gum...". It's the same man who tried to sell to me and Monica and later to Catherine and me. Now, it was the first time she met Sofia and Cathy.

Was he lying, too? Was he one of the 7 who sees me?

Do the strangers lie or they address me with kindness?

Will I escape the people who knows my past to surround me with strangers so that I can live with my persona hidden in a secret?

## 2016-02-27

It's almost midnight and I'm in bed. I have the phone next to my pillow. I'm not talking with Catherine, not tonight. In the computer I had the whatsapp site open. I looked for Monica's conversation and typed the damned question. I hesitated to click enter. I went to bed with that day's conversation still in mind. I have the question typed in Monica's conversation in my phone. I want to push enter. I want her to read it. I know she's online and won't see it until tomorrow, I don't care. I want to know. I want to know if he saw me. I want to know if I was recognized. His reaction won't be camouflaged in kindness. He hates me. I know how my friends react, people who love me, or claimed to, do. The reaction of someone who loathes me is invaluable, unbiased.

It would be a secret. I'm planning not to even mention Catherine. I won't mention the question, the hesitation. I don't even plan to say a word about her response. I think about possible answers. "No, he didn't." That would be it. All for nothing. "Yes, but he didn't recognize you" That's the one I hope for, but why? What does it change? It makes no difference and yet my heart starts running and fears that because of my anticipation it will never come. "Yes, he saw you and was surprised, he didn't say nothing" "...he said something". Would I ask her what was it? It would be an endless fall with no end. I would want to know what he said, and then, how she reacted, and then what she felt, and then how he answered back. Did she tell him something? Does he know now? Does her family?... That's what I fear. And then it comes. The most possible answer, the one that I don't expect and yet, after its arrival I would feel like an idiot for not seeing it come:

"I don't remember" "Ivan, don't start"

I throw the phone away and go to sleep.

It's nine o'clock. I went to the United States. I feel manly, freakish. I feel broken, betrayed. It's not that I think she let me down. I don't doubt what she told me. I doubt that I asked for the right information. She might have answered with the truth, but that's not what I wanted to know. It helped me shit that she sees me like a woman if nobody else does. How many times was I exposed and vulnerable? How many people didn't see me and thought ridicule of me? How many of them did laugh or pointed or avoided me?

I am a doubt. I am a freak. I have no changes. I have not changed physically at all.

Monica was a bitch because of her answer and yet I feel sorrow at cause of Catherine's opposite one. She sees me as a woman and I was fooled by it. I trusted my own false image. I let myself believe I was invisible.

How ridicule will I look when I tell my parents?

I thought about mentioning. I want to make an appointment to clean my facial hair with laser. I want to get rid of it. Why? Because I don't like it. I don't like it because it makes me look like a boy.

It was something to say. A little thing. I'm not asking them for money. I'm not asking them for permission. I am letting them know. I am sharing it. I couldn't open my mouth. Did they notice my silence? Does anyone ever?

I shared something else. I said how the guard didn't recognize me last time I crossed. I narrated the incident but omitted my outfit and my face. I left out the most important thing. "You know how sometims I wear make up? I wore it that day". My father would be furious. How could I be so foolish? What if they said something or took me to secondary inspection?

Why would I wear make up anyway?

"I would not risk being seen with that ambiguity. Knowing that I lie between a boy and a girl. I would not wear those clothes or make up, not until I had started changes"

I was angry and decided to know. I sent the question to Monica. And then I asked the same to Anahi. How do I look? I thought about telling Johanna, about sending another one-way letter to Helena. What do I care how they react? They are half a world away from me. They know almost nothing of me. They won't miss me. They won't note my absence.

I had no internet so I didn't.

I smiled with Anahi's response. It seemed honest and clumsy and sincere. And yet, was she really saying the truth? Can I really trust in the people who care?

## 2016-02-28

I'm full of energy and anxiety. My leg is restless and agitated. There is music in my ears but it doesn't calm me.

Many languages that I mostly don't understand. What was the last song in my own manner of speech? For a moment I forget it's spanish. I've lived where that tongue was born. I've stood in that country, in that city. I've seen the moon from that distant place.

Yesterday I thought about sending my secret towards there. I could tell Germany, I could tell Estonia. Did her mother die? Did she get a job or started her master?

Did Johanna ever wonder what caused my melancholy? Did Helena ever imagine my obsessive thoughts with her? One was way more obvious than the other.

I thought about sending her an audio message in her birthday. I didn't. Hers was little after mine. Helena was earlier, last year. Which could I tell first? Helena's reaction worries me less. I did kiss her, but maybe it actually never even happened. Johanna was closest and yet we haven't had a conversation in months, haven't heard her voice in years. What do I win telling them? Another person knowing, another one who knows before the ones who could actually help me. Another practice. Maybe that is it.

I asked her again. "How would you had told Paola?" "The same way you did, I guess". I remembered her my thoughts about her reaction. "I freaked out, sorry". I could ask Paola herself how did she take it. What were or are her thoughts. I could ask her Wednesday I will see her. I will deliver her book. I will see everybody again. All but Anahi.

Anahi is my best friend now. I asked her just as I did Monica. Monica is still silent, gone. Do I ignore her phantom or is it gone also? The times that I reluctantly go back to her conversation to see her last time online it marks the same way. Maybe she went out. Maybe she uninstalled the app. Maybe she ignored it. And yet again I am here writing about it, waiting, wondering and expecting. The answer will be trivial. Later I won't even remember it.

The Oscars were today. Leo won. I told Catherine how I didn't want Redmayne to win. I knew there would be stupid jokes in the internet. And then, when Leo's name was called and he gave his speech I thought about what would Eddie had said. Would I feel as Anahi felt with Lady Gaga's song about rape?

I was ignoring what was happening until I saw my phone and in it Anahi's crying emojis. I rewinded it and payed attention.

Weekend is almost over. My mother is alone in her bedroom and I'm here typing. Catherine and Anahi are both asleep. Eusebio didn't see my last messages. Maybe tomorrow I can message Paola and start a conversation. Follow Catherine's advice.

Next week, after graduation I will call and make an appointment in the laser place. I will have a "grad present' with that money maybe I could pay it myself. I should mention it to my parents. I don't want to go and talk to my mother now. I don't want to talk to her even more without saying a word to my father.

Catherine dreamed with me last night. We were in the movies and there was this game where you passed your phone. After the movie ended I realized I was phone-less. Catherine took it upon herself to go ask if someone had it. Everyone pointed towards the next person and she continued looking. Even I wasn't in the dream anymore. It was all about Catherine's search. A theater, even the swap meet where we went. Miguel, lastly Jhonny gave her a necklace which fit with something she already had. She felt relieved and woke up.

I interpreted her dream as her guilt over my "lost secret", she wanted to see who knew about me. Who could give me the answer and confidence I lost. At the end, she got a necklace instead, symbolizing our relationship.

Next week is the graduation. I will see the patient wednesday's morning and from there I'll go to my therapy. A day before I'll have my rehearsal. Thursday I'll pick the grad dress or however is called. Friday will be the ceremony and Saturday's evening the party. And then it will all be over. Will I tell them after it? Will I pick another late date or will it finally be it?

Will this desperation make me tell them even earlier?

"What did you do today?" "Nothing"

I really thought I had done nothing. I was wrong. I did a lot. I looked for people. I sent a message to Eusebio and talk almost more with Anahi than with Catherine. I started a conversation with Hilda. I opened up. I woke up late. It was past noon when I got up from bed. My dad was already home. Last night were just my mother and me. I think I heard her leave in the morning. I know I dreamed something but I can't recall anything from it.

I heard the door and the keys. I heard the footsteps climbing the stairs. I didn't know if it was Miguel or my dad until I went outside. "Have you eaten?" "No" "Do you want me to get you something?" "No, it's ok, I have something in here".

We were all alone today. It was like yesterday's evening when it was the perfect opportunity to bring the subject. He was lying in the couch and I was on the other one. There was no one else who could interrupt us or listen to it. I felt nervousness and my heart raced. I let it go. I let it escape. The moment passed.

That's when I took a shower. He picked up Miguel from college. I shaved both my legs and my face. I had cuts all over my shins. My face was smooth. I could had mentioned it. It didn't have to be about me or my gender or my appointment. It could be just mentioning my plans. "I'm thinking about looking for a laser treatment for my beard."

"Why?" "Why would yo do something like that?" They might laugh. They might mock.

Why do I want them both to be present?

Monica hasn't gone online. Sure I sent the message but I still avoid her. Why did I archived the conversation as soon as I touched send? What was I looking away from? What is it that I don't want to see? Whom do I want to convince that I don't care?

Catherine doesn't know. Nobody, not even she, knows that I sent it. The message left my phone but hasn't reached hers. It's still there, somewhere, floating, like a ghost.

I unarchived the conversation and let it be. Why should I be so afraid of it? It the answer really doesn't matter, then it won't change nothing. Then it has no importance.

Tomorrow it's the rehearsal of the grad. I'll meet Catherine in the afternoon in school. I'll drive and wait there. Tonight I will interpret some of her tests and look for other ones to apply. Maybe I can just use another session and finish. Less than an hour and I'll be paid 125 pesos.

Tomorrow I won't shave. I'll wear something normal. I should always be wearing something normal. I heard it, I learned it. I don't pass. I knew that already. She's right. She had told me before. Why did this time was different?

Why do I keep thinking about what to wear then? Why do I keep caring? I will wear the leggings. Will I? Will I meet my patient like that? "You can always just introduce yourself as Sofia the psychologist. You don't have to explain anything".

"You usually say your name before, though. It all depends." And yes it does. She already knows who I am. She knows my name. Will she know my face? Does it make a difference?

There was that microsoft page that guesses your age and gender with a picture. When I read about it, several people mentioned these other, more advanced sites. Face++ was one of them. Yesterday I looked for it. I saved a couple of pictures. One of my birthday, the one where I supposedly look like a teenager and the recent one.

One, the recent, the first I sent, said I was a boy with a 99.9% of certainty. It was a little hurting but it wasn't wrong. I couldn't be more objective than that. It had certainty degrees and a complicated algorithm and an unbiased non-feeling computer behind it. Catherine might lie, even unconsciously for my own sake. Anahi might lie for not hurting me. Strangers might condescend for kindness. But a computer doesn't care. A computer doesn't think or wonders, it just answers. Its task is to guess my age and gender and that's what it'll do.

The other ones said female with a more than 90% certainty. I didn't believe them either.

## 2016-03-01

"Excited? ... Make use of it. I know you don't like being who you are not. I'm not telling you to enjoy when they call you Ivan, but, being honest, Ivan deserves a lot of things, too. I believe, from my humble opinion, a good bye?
And when you tell me I get a excited. When you say it's your last party that they'll celebrate with Ivan, I get excited about you, Sofia. "

Just know I shared with Catherine how I asked Anahi about how I looked those times I wore woman's clothes. I copied and pasted the first answer she gave me, warning me, making sure that I wouldn't take offense from it. I said I was going to the bathroom but in reality I went for something to drink. Tea this time. Now I don't want nor need alcohol.

I pasted her long "three thousand words essay". "Wow, how did it make you feel?".

Honestly, I don't know. It was nice. I would be lying if I had said that it was a relief or it wasn't the reason I am even considering wearing something feminine tomorrow. But that's not all of it. There was something else. An insecurity, maybe? A sick disbelief.

Today I dressed as masculine as I dared. "As masculine" I imagine with that answer dressing as the mid semesters from my career when I used formal pants and dark shirts. I dress as a caricature of an adult, an exaggeration of a man. I dressed like a little child trying to be his father. I was trying to be my dad. Being who he wanted me to? No, he never asked that from me. I wanted it.

I assimilated that expectation. I was the little boy who said he would be an engineer like his father. I would work with computers. I liked math and the sciences. I was excited to learn physics and chemistry. What happened then? I learned those subjects but didn't like them. They weren't what I expected? They failed me like I will fail my dad?

No.

In jr high I entered the electricity shop. It was full of men. I didn't dislike it, but didn't enjoy it either. I had my friend Medrano, and I wondered, I remember the choice. Communications or Electronics. Miguel chose that path. Miguel did follow my father's footsteps. I remember looking at them, chatting, ordering parts. My father was proud of him, helping him in his projects. He never did that with me. Was he disappointed as Medrano when I didn't went that way?

I followed Monica. It wasn't that I wanted to be with her. I wanted the chance to know her. Talk with her. To me, she wasn't Monica. I knew her name. But I didn't knew her. I chatted with her, had an idea of who she was. She was the X girl, to me. She was an avatar for the idealization of the persona I had created. She was the materialization of the femininity that I repressed and hid. I avoided being with men. I wanted a mixed group.

And then it happened. The first day when I didn't talk to her. No, that was what I believed. I did talk. I talk with her and Joanna and some other girls. I look in front of me, and behind me, all around me there were girls. And I didn't fit with them.

I didn't fit with men in jr high and I didn't fit with women then. I just didn't fit. I had chosen that path and I was lost and alone.

That was the trigger. Even Alan who moved to my class couldn't help me. I finally got close to her and could displace that femininity to her again. I fit the role of the male. I wasn't alone, I felt loved. I lived in my own fantasy bubble.

Today it was the rehearsal. I will be the first person in the line who will enter. I will come in and take my seat. Half of our generation behind me. "I thought about making my own speech". She rolled her eyes. It was like with Anahi and her, when I did their parts. It's not that I don't want you to do it. I did it for me. Anahi screamed and left. "It's for me". I said again.

Would I write it? Hilda told me her GPA is lower than me. I might be Magna Cum Laude. I might have a diploma and a postgraduate study free of charge.

But will I take it? It's like a safety net. I could stay here. Study some more. Do some more. Lose more time in this limbo. Or I could keep looking for a job, get out of here, travel and change my name. Be who I want to be. Be who I really am.

For that I have to have first to courage to say my name out loud.

## 2016-03-02

"Sofia has a face of not knowing"

I didn't expect it from her. Now that I write it, she's the person from whom I should had expected it most.

"I'll dress him very handsome for the graduation of his aunts"

It feels good but fake. An undeserved pleasure. I was driving home when I realized. I wonder about them believing my name because I don't. I fear of them thinking it's a game or a nickname, because I'm terrified of actually embracing it and make it mine. I am scared of having to fight for it. Defend it, defend me.

"Ivan, are there women who, you know, operate themselves, but, uh, like men who made themselves women, transexuals..." "Men who were born women? Yes, there are."

Why, why does he ask? What is it that gives him the curiosity?

The alarm clocked started singing at 6 in the morning. I could hear the showers upstairs. My dad was in the bathroom. I had no reason to get up then. I could wait. There was a second alarm. I stayed awake, anyway. I did shave. I did my hair. I wore a gray undershirt but took it off in my room. I wore pants but took them off too and put on the leggings. I looked myself in the mirror with my face shaven. It doesn't matter how close I do it, there is always dark spots. They always are seen.

I guess I do have to wear a mask.

I drove to Liliana's office. It was early. Catherine yesterday told me she was thinking about not going to school. She was in the border crossing line when I was getting ready. I arrived and looked for the guard in my male outfit. How much change could there be. I just had women's jeans and a clean face. Those were the only changes.

"Young man" he noticed me and opened the office. I waited there. It was early. Time caught up. It passed us. 15 minutes after our meeting time I sent Catherine a text. "What is it? Why me? What do I have that I can have a patient? Why do people don't give me a chance? She hasn't even seen me."

I thought she was inside the building or on her way to school. The patient said "Good morning" from the waiting room.

I applied the tests I carried and later did a short interview. She paid me. I left the money in her desk but it still was my first pay. I sent a text to Lili tonight, telling her about the money and the session. She asked how it went and told me her mother has a meeting next tuesday for the results. I offered to send her the report before printing and signing it. "If you like... thanks my beautiful girl".

Why did I feel warmth like with Paola's comment about her son's aunts? Why did I believe them and felt cared about? What is it? Why can't I see my own mother making some comments like that?

Is it really more difficult for them to accept it? To call me their daughter, to see my like a woman. To accept me and love me.

Catherine loves me as who I am. Anahi is my best friend, mutual, the first one, and cares for me the same way. Paola made the question about how to treat me. She changed the name and used it several times today. "I like your lip color" she said as she got there.

I returned from Liliana. I made breakfast and ate it. I applied make up before leaving but messed it up several times. Three times I had to color my lips. I try to sharpen the pencil's point and ended up using the lipstick.

"I had my first patient today" I started the session with Rene, "of course I wasn't wearing this".

Would had there been any difference with her? I would had a reason to attribute her absence. It's not logical because she wouldn't had known anyway, but still.

I felt peoples' sights all the way from my car to the building. Their eyes were heavy, like big and wet water balloons splashing me.

All the way back and the drive to the plaza. Chevo was already sitting waiting for us outside the movies. Catherine was sitting in her car parked with an empty spot besides her. I put make up again to cover the shadow in my face.

Nobody confirmed me today. There was no validation but Paola's different Sofias. Do they count?

Did Eusebio hear? The first one we were just the four of us. Then Jessica was there when she said I would roll the stairs. Did they notice? Do they care? Are they waiting for me to say something?

Should I wait after the graduation? We won't see each other until friday's ceremony and then it will be the party.

I will be dressed as a boy, I will be playing that character again, for the lasts times. What difference does it make?

Today. Today's feelings should had been difference enough. Is it really that I don't dare? I'm not courageous. I'm not brave. I am a coward.

I am fear materialized.

## 2016-03-03

There was something strange in today's morning sounds. I could hear my mother's voice at the same time of my dad's, Miguel and Luis were talking at the same time. The four of them were in the same room. Why was I awake? Did I dream something? I remember this weird sensation in my body. My head busy sorting thoughts. Separating fantasy from reality. Every morning is like a review of what has really happened and what has just been fiction.

The door was opened and the voices departed. I went back to slumber.

The door was opened again and there were steps around the house. Was Miguel home already? It was 9 in the morning. I think I checked the phone. It was my mother. Did she talk? Was it the phone? I realized it was her voice, her presence. What was she doing here? Whom did I tell? Catherine?

"My mother is here." I stood up and exited the room. My eyes were half-closed. "What happened?" I asked for a short answer and she narrated me her story. She has this, something, that she thought was hemorroids. They started growing so she went today to the hospital. The ER guy checked her. When he actually saw, he arranged her a meeting with the specialist. She has the meeting for the 7th.

Catherine offered me today of going to the movies, going to the hotel. I wouldn't shave today. I don't want to do anything of the sorts. I am not ok. I feel sad, I feel desperate and anxious. It's like time's running so fast around me, teasing him and I can't catch it. I'm dizzy with its motion and just want it to stop. At the same time I wish I just were as fast as it.

I wrote the time in the male persona. I went back to change it to the material it.

Several times I had thunk today about telling Catherine, asking her, not to talk until Sunday. After the party, after the ceremony. After all of this.

We went to pick up the, I don't know, graduation dress. Whatever it's called. She came for me after her salon. We picked the pictures. Asked for the different size. They did have ours saved in the system. It was just a matter of paying and waiting. He welcomed me with a young man. Of course he did. Now even a single day is enough for me to have a visible stub. I fantasize about plucking each and every one of those hairs. Feeling them hurt, grasping my skin and screaming as they let go. Enjoy the pain of their leaving.

Why haven't I made the appointment for the laser place? Is it really bigger the fear I have of telling my parents than the displeasure of being seen like this?

The next place was picking up the cloth. In the way, I saw a message of Melissa who said the ribbon would be given to us tomorrow. I had already saw how it was made. The psyches were red when they should had been yellow. The name is bigger and has a bigger psyche over it. The logo of the university is a green and ugly, the cloth itself is broader. The whole thing is a disaster.

Catherine felt even more distressed because she was the one who brought Ramon. She fears everyone will blame her. I just want all of this to end. I can't take it. I want to get over it. Sunday I'll have all of this behind me.

In her message Melissa said to take our id and an insurance of address. I didn't have any with me. Catherine either. There was a big notice posted in the wall saying they would ask for them with no exception.

The lady argue they told us when they gave us the receipt. They sure had given us that white paper. We had never seen it in our life. The lady who took our measures confessed, she didn't give us that paper, but she did say it. Maybe she did. I don't know.

They finally compromised and just check the address were the same as the one written in the receipt.

I tried it on. I didn't feel no excitement or fulfillment or emotion. It was a disguise. Another piece of cloth. Something to hid and go undetected.

We ate in the burger place near my house before picking the pictures. I thought I heard the waitress mix up her way to address me. It was an accident.

Outside my house, we kissed and touch. I put on a condom and we touched each other in the visitation parking.

I should interpret the tests, make the report. I've had a headache all day. I just want to lie down and sleep. Get over this.

Let it pass, let it end.

## 2016-03-04

"I have to go now. Sorry about my first message after all this time being about this, but I really wanted to know. I don't know how you are about me and everything that happened. You can talk to me if you want, or not. However, I understand. I hope you are all right."

"Pretties"
"Excuse me, girl"
"And academic mention to Ivan Fernandez for having the most perfect hair in this generation"
"I didn't recognize you with your flowing locks"

Today she had been online. I had already my clothes and broke fast. I was just waiting to leave. I was walking and opened her conversation. She was last online today in the morning. No. Before that I saw a red exclamation mark next to my message. It was not sent. I could click it to send it again. She had been online in the morning. She was alive. I had already checked.

Should I? Could I? Would I?

I touched it. And it came the first check, and then the second. I tried to hide my phone. I was scared, nervous. The message was received. Then they turned blue. A green Typing appeared under her name. Again I tried to lose the screen.

"red one, Sorry, I passed to leave Vania" "Okay, I'm doing my words." I wrote.

I made a mistake. It was the wrong conversation. Monica had not been online. It doesn't matter. She just wrote back. "How was it?"

I didn't really think she would write back. I saw it as closure. After the blue checks and time passed. I had, nothing. I just didn't expect.

In the morning. Her first message was an answer "no" and a disclaimer. Had I sent another messages? Her phone was stolen. She had just gotten whatsapp back. I had my answer. I didn't need nothing more. But I kept. And so did she. She talk as if nothing had happened. It hurt. Her message hurt. Why did I stay?

How are you? she asked. Did she really care?

I left. I sent her the message and I left.

I waited for Catherine in the plaza where Anahi goes to therapy. I had my gray pants and blue shirt and curly long hair. My face is clean. I looked manly. It was the beginning. I needed to get ready. These two days would be of closure.

Ramon took our pictures. There were some girls already there. Catherine was with Vania. She put on the grad dress and then I did. They gave us our ribbon and one by one we stepped for our picture. I went after Catherine. My pose would be different of theirs. He wanted me to cross my arms in front of me. Lift my chin and keep my back straight. The picture was taken and I saw it. It was good. It was fine. I didn't look like a man. I didn't look like Ivan. I looked... fine

After leaving. No. We waited. We waited until the matter of our party pictures was arranged. Hilda Catherine and me stayed there. Ramon took the camera and asked us to get together. We would have a special picture. "The gentleman in the midde". It was fine. These two days would be full with those kind of comments. I expected them. For now I was immune.

Hilda was by my left and Catherine to my right. "Closer... closer". I liked that picture.

When we leaved...


Catherine arrived. TOmorrow I will contine.

Sorry, this will end here.

## 2016-03-05

Sorry I'l have to cheat again.

In a couple of hours I will leave to the party. Liliana sent me text message asking how the report is going. I freaked out and told her I would have it by tomorrow. Now, I have to write the words, too, but I think I will just cheat today.

Yesterday I went with my parents to Cheripan, the argentinian restuarant. My mother ordered a choripan while I asked for a churrasco. I didn't drink anything. I would drink plenty today. After returning, Catherine sent me a text. Could I go out? She felt as if we didn't spent enough time just the two of us.

I remember the pictures. I liked them. I looked fine. We looked equal.

Now I am wearing my tux and I won't look the same. "Congratulations to the two bachelors" (in the male neutral). I wanted to correct her. I didn't. Just one more day. Just today.

My father had asked me the same question. Was I planning on going somewhere else after dinner? I answered no. I really had no plans. So when Catherine asked I hesitated. I did want to go. I could use a drink. I went upstairs to my parents' room and started innocuous conversation before telling them about leaving. They almost convinced me of going. I tend to do that with them. Looking indecisive so they push me into doing what I want do, instead of me asking permission.

I can't do that with my situation.

And I kept writing instead of grading the test.

Catherine drove me to plaza Fiesta. We could go to El tigre or Zenzontle. It was full. It was filled with people. We walked a little but ended up deciding to go somewhere else. We could drive a little to Paseo Chapultepec, they had some nice places and we were already dressed nice.

1994 was the place where we went. That cozy bar where we met with the rest of the group. We stayed there for a while. After our liter she drove me home.

No, it was when we arrived to the parking lot. She was looking for an empty slot when the car in front of us put on its reverse lights. She stopped and waited. The car came to us closer and closer. She honked but it was still coming. She honked again and again. until the rear met us in a crash. She kept honking out of desperation. She opened the door and got out. The driver of the white car did the same. He was an american. They saw there was no damage done so it all ended there. The guy would let us the empty spot he found a little while later.

I went to sleep. She slept with my long red sweater.

Today in the morning after breakfast I took the robe and little funny hat and returned them. I could stop somewhere and buy a nice spaniard wine. There was a licor shop near the place of the rent of tuxedos. I didn't find it. After returning the clothes and getting my id back, I went towards Galerias plaza. Wal-mart. I found a bottle of wine from 5 years ago. The same year we entered school. I also bought a bottle of asturian sidra.

I am all dressed and ready with my words almost finished and the tests still unchecked. I haven't written a single word of the report and yet I told "my boss" I would have it by tomorrow. While in a couple of hours I'll go to my graduation party and won't come back until after 2 in the morning.

I made the same mistake again today. Catherine had asked me at what time would I tell my parents to go take our picture. I wrote "near 6, I guess" but sent it to the wrong conversation.

It's the second time. It was a coincidence, and yet it still seems wrong.

She returned yesterday after my calling of the obvious. Hey* she corrected. She came back. I, instead of hating her, hated myself. Why did I put myself in that place again? And after the superficial conversation I ended with a pathetic request. "Don't be a stranger, ok?"

That's what she is.

No. She has always been Monica. All of her life she's stayed the same way. I hadn't met her when I saw her as the nameless girl. Then I idolized her. Then I really got to know her. But she's been the same person.

I am the one who changed. I am the one who is a stranger to her.

After my mistake she saw it but said nothing.

Now I did archived her conversation. I won't make the same mistake and I can stop looking at her picture if the silence returns.

## 2016-03-06

It's done. It's over. I'm finished with school. Well, not really, I mean, I still have to go and actually do the procedure to get my license. But, I gave my parents their party. I wore the tuxedo. I went and took the picture with them. I danced with Catherine. I laughed and drank with my friends.

"There's no shame in being tired (feminine)"

The last letters were off screen but I know what she wrote. I was there. She asked me if I wanted it that way. I did. She published it.

Everyone took pictures and videos. We all had a good time. A couple of flashing moments of real feeling struck me several times in the night. I drowned them in alcohol. For once it actually worked. I went ahead and got in line in the last assistance list. We made a toast. It didn't count towards the challenge I had with Chevo and Paola. Everyone in the table knew about me. Jhonny hadn't arrived yet. Yarely's boyfriend ignores my story, too, I guess.

"The most beautiful hair in the faculty" greeted me Viramontes when I met him outside the bathroom.

"Isn't he handsome, that cabron?", said again to the group of people he was with when I exited other time. Was it the time when I couldn't control my breathing inside the cubicle?

I remember thinking about how I had the escape plan ready. I could go with my parents and ask them to leave whenever I felt anxious or dysphoric. In the afternoon when I put on the suit and was grading the tests it was heavy and uncomfortable. It was like a cage, constricting me, asphyxiating me.

I remember seeing the pictures of Ramon and liking them. I was surprised of how good I looked. Even though I was a man, I could see me in those eyes and that smile.

In the party I got desperate with the absence of organization. There was no map of tables. We didn't know which was our table, where could we sit? What would I do? Claudia had the list, I guess, but she didn't publish it. One by one she was saying their tables as we asked. Catherine was in her way.

I met Chevica for the second time that day. I sat with them in Catherine's table. I saw Luis sitting bored, listening to music, quiet. Why was I sad about him? I felt like I had abandoned him. Inviting him felt like a punishment.

One by one I destroyed my suit. First it was the coat, after that, the tie. Then, after midnight, I took off my vest.

Where would we go as an after-party? Jhonny asked us. Paola had already said we could go take a shot to finish the day. I didn't want to say no. I wanted to go, but how could I? My parents would wait for me? Would they take me or pick me up? I didn't want to ask permission. After the party ended, they said we should go ask. I did. At first my parents didn't know what to do. Where would I go? Was it far? Would they wait for me? Could they?

Then, Catherine asked their parents if they could drive me home so my parents could go their way. They said yes. I asked her if she was sure. When I told my dad, he asked me the same question. Sure. They would take me. It was all set.

Except that it wasn't really the plan. Jhonny wanted us to stay in his house. When he said that I thought there would be more of us. He did sit with Miguel. He stayed with him and danced with him, chatted with him. We joked about him, how Miguel was waiting for him. He had left him all alone.

We had to go so Miguel would go, too. Catherine could ask her parents but I would need to, first. In one of the videos they took, I can see myself in the phone talking with my mother, asking her permission. "Who is this jhonny? Was he with you in the table? Where does he live?"

It's just the second time that I stay in somebody's house, and yet to my parents I've done it a lot more.

I had their yes. After another call, Catherine had hers.

We drank the shot. And then, Paola asked me to drink the absynth one. The didn't have it. So we ordered a similar one. Then the bartender gave the girls a free one.

Jessica passed hers to me and I gave the little glass back empty to her.

I went to the bathroom. Paolas went first. Paola was drunk as hell. She was literally speaking in english. Paola called an uber to pick them up. Later I would know paola's mother would intercept it and take Paola to the hospital. She was that drunk.

We went to a karaoke and drank a beer. Jhonny sang. We ate hot dogs in the dawn and took a taxi to jhonny's apartment. I undressed and slept in his spare room with Catherine.

I told her I loved her.

We had sex and my foreskin got stuck. Catherine would hear the sounds of the bed in the other room.

"Our little kid will have your name" he told me last night.

"Ivan... and if it's a girl?"

"Sofia" I wanted to tell him.

Now there is no reason to not tell my parents. If I hadn't gone, I actually think I would had done it.

## 2016-03-07

The gas dispatcher welcomed us in the feminine form. He didn't correct himself after, but then again I don't know what he saw. If it wasn't for his word I would never had known anyway.

Does it change anything? Is there like a meter that measures the number of people who sees me in a certain way? Under a certain number I don't qualify as being a woman.

I wasn't going to do anything today. I sent a text message in the morning to Lili. She answered almost instantly. I could send her the report by whatsapp so she would read it so I can present it to the patient tomorrow. After the link I got nothing back. I went back to sleep and didn't get up from bed until almost noon. I remember a couple of nightmares. They weren't the usual ones of a catastrophe or a interpersonal conflict. They were surreal. I knew I was dreaming. I found myself in this kind of mansion where I of course knew terrible things were gonna happen. I saw myself and tried to wake up. I tried to take control of the dream. I could turn the lights on, I could get away. It was my mind that created everything. I could do whatever I wanted. Except I didn't.

I woke up and fell asleep again. I fooled myself into thinking I was safe in reality. And then a glimpse of failed imitation of physics or a realization that the clothes I were wearing were not right with the moment would bring me back to my panic and frustration.

Yesterday I worried that I would not be able to sleep in the night. I fell asleep without a problem and continued to do until noon.

Miguel got in early. He opened the door and went upstairs. Catherine was answering my question about how were we going to resolve signing the report. She had returned already from the doctor so she offered me to go and eat in her house. I didn't want to get ready. I didn't want to change clothes. I didn't even want to shower. So Miguel's request made everything easier. "Could you give a ride to the sports unit?"

It was pouring and yet the kid wanted to do some exercise. I went and showered. Sure. Little balls of ice trickled in my windshield when I parked to leave him. I arrived in Catherine's house with the tank almost empty. She had no white sheets into which to print our report.

"Hello, tal-Ivan" said his father. He smiled and joked, he's kind with me. Her mother is the one who made a face when Catherine's aunt asked her to take a picture with me. She's the one who doesn't like me the same way after knowing about me. Maybe with his father will be similar. Maybe he'll resent me for being a freak who is in love with his daughter.

We went to fill the tank after eating the soup. Then Soriana. I told Catherine about Monica's messages. "Answer mee" she had said. Why was I talking to her? Was I betraying my own feelings?

Why did I think about asking her about my francs? She didn't give them to me for a reason. It was a way to start the conversation. When I told Catherine I really didn't remember how she came from the archived conversation after my mistake.

I archived her now again.

"Have you spend my francs?" "No"
"Not even in gambling and skanks?" "No"
"Lame"

Three times. Three messages and two nos. I talked with Catherine how I made a mistake continuing her conversation and I was here again, starting it. And for what? A couple of european coins.

Catherine's phone rang as we stopped in front of her house. Her parents would go to the doctor. While their absence we fucked on her bed. The trojan condom felt weird. I remember how it was the only one which I could actually wear and now it was loose and ill-fitting.

We went downstairs and watched the movie Zoolander. I fell asleep on her shoulder. I hugged her and kissed her.

We had just signed our first report as psychologists. It felt weird when I finally got an answer from Liliana. I had to change my own conclusions. I imagined she wouldn't want me to put a diagnostic on. The therapy recommendations were off, too.

What if she just wanted the results? What if my "good job" was not enough?

Maybe my work is just wrong?

It feels weak, poorly supported. Maybe my whole thing about doing everything perfect is because I don't value myself?

At least I hope I will get paid.

## 2016-03-08

Since last week that I saw the patient I have not written in the journal. The last time that I attempted to fill a notebook was with the university's planner that I bought in the gift shop. I used it for a couple of months and then forgot about it. Left it there, grouping blank days.

Now I have this little notebook that I bought with Catherine the day that we saw The Danish Girl. It was February? Now I have a blank week that I want to fill.

Will I be able to remember what I've done? What have I done this week? I saw my first paid patient. I applied test in a professional setting for the first time. That day was my last session with Rene. I came home and changed clothes. Was that the day that I met with Paola and Chevo and Jessica? Yeah, I think so.

"I like your lip's color" She called me Sofia twice.

This weekend Lili texted me to see how we were going with the report. I panicked and said I would have it by Sunday.

And I did. I had it. Now, today, I delivered it. I dressed nicely if I had to meet with the patient's mother. She wasn't there. I was sharing Lili's session. She asked for my input. I delivered results, handed her the report.

By the end of it I had my feedback. I am a charismatic, empathetic, glowing. "How many times have you done this before?" It was actually my first and I said the truth. Did she expect it? Maybe she could see where I lacked. Maybe I seemed knowing and experienced.

She kept talking about this other project. A workshop about tests. At first I believed it was about Catherine and me giving it. No, she wants us to take it. Maybe then we could have more patients. Where will I get patients? Now it's not that I don't believe I'm ready. It's not the knowledge that I lack, it's the patients. The thought about paying for them to teach me more sickens me. More even that they expect me to get patients so I can pay them.

I got stuck in traffic on the way home. Was that it? Was it meeting Ana Karen? She hugged me and said hi. "He also graduated". Did she know I've met Liliana? Maybe she left with the idea I'm another of her patients.

"Erick" "Erick" "...Ivan". She apologized. I'm not Erick, but I'm not Ivan, either.

She called me several different nicknames, petnames along the session and the feedback. All her adjectives were male. Of course they were. I presented that way.

I can think of me, imagine myself and I don't cringe anymore. Do I?

Why did that picture came to mind? The one I took outside Rene's office. I don't like my face. I don't like my complexion nor lips. It was that same day, the same one of my meetings.

...So I came home after 40 minutes. And when I arrive to the private, I can see my father's pick up. It fills me with rage. I couldn't get before him. Now I have to park outside him and came all the way in, look for him and ask him if he wants to move the cars, return and move back so he can get out, get the car in and wait for him. Then I can come home and get in.

It irritates me even more how I can sense they are in the living room. They are not far from the door and yet, knowing I've arrived, hearing how I fumble with the keys, they stay where they are.

I come in Miguel is lying in the couch. My parents were in the table. Just seeing me enter my father asks "let's move the cars".

I threw the stuff in my bed and returned to my car. When I put reverse, I almost kicked the pedal so I would crash with the gate. I'm furious. What is it? What was it?

I come back and eat, again, for the third time. Even after my salad I would go to the fridge and grab a hot dog and a bologna.

Today I had another dream. Catherine told me how since Sunday I've been uneasy in my sleep. Yesterday it was about how I couldn't get out of my dream. Today I defended some movie's character and got confronted with the bigot's doubt. Why was I caring? He grabbed my hands and looked at me suspicious. I feared he would move them to my chest, feel my bra, know about me, hit me, do something.

It wasn't any bigot. It was Nicolai. Jaime Nicolai from grade school. I didn't tell Catherine that, she doesn't know about him. There is nothing to know about him. I haven't seen him in more than 10 years. There is nothing from the time I knew him that could even relate to this.

What does he have to do with my fear of judgement? With my frustration of not being able to wake up from this nightmare?

## 2016-03-09

I haven't started.

I was dreaming and yet I knew it. I tried to control it again, but failed. I could use the opportunity to tell my dad. He was driving. We were in a mall. Outside Target, there were no other stores, just houses. Houses, again, just like the mansion in that other dream I could not control.

I would later narrate my dream to Rene. The second, most important part. I was more conscious about my being inside a lucid dream. I entered voluntarily to the house. I knew I could control it, make my mom appear. I went upstairs. Outside there was a three plants house, in the inside it was endless. Several different rooms, connectors and stairs. Inside them there were numerous and infinite rooms. Huge, gigantic furniture. I looked for a more normal one. I'd later find it and lie on the bed.

I made my mother appear in the room. Inside, she wasn't my mom. "My mom is not my favorite person in the world and yet the person in front of me wasn't her. It was even less." I called for my real mom and another one appeared. She also wasn't and my mind asked for another. Again, a third person entered. I was sick of it and blurted it out. "I'm trans". There, it was out. Nothing would happen when I would wake up. It was a no-consequence-exercise.

I can't even remember how she reacted. Was she surprised, angry? Was she disbelieving?

Nothing came out of it and I finally woke up.

I could interpret the other ones from earlier nights, bu this one? What could this one mean?

"Well, wasn't it what really happened?"

"You wanted your "perfect" mother to appear and she never did. You told her and nothing came out of it. An yet, the interesting part was that even in a dream you couldn't tell your dad, the one who you want to tell the most".

Today I didn't cried, just listened.

I shaved in the shower with the cheap razor. The one with which I shaved my legs. They're smooth now. I can't remember the last time I did it. It's a subtle little difference.

I applied make up and looked fine. I picked Catherine from near the crossing border. She had bought two tacos for sharing. I drove to Playas. A movie and then our cafe.

We ate the tacos, but where? In the movies? Yeah, in the parking lot. We bought the tickets to Zoolander 2. I laughed. I hugged her. She put her hand inside my leggings.

From there I parked near the park so she could apply more make up to my face and cover my facial hair. I applied the pencil instead of the lipstick. She put the foundation so I wouldn't have to see my face.

In the cafe I don't know if I were recognized. The new waitresses don't know us. There is just one from before we left the country two years ago. She gave us our menus and forgot about us until Catherine went down to order. The other waitress would constantly come upstairs to ask us how we were and if we needed anything.

We took pictures and videos. I shared some of them in snapchat. Sent them to Chevo and Paolas and Anahi.

We were talking with Anahi about tomorrow. What would I wear? How would we cross. What could we do with the cars? Anahi would cross in her car from otay. And us? what would we do when we return later at night? I have to take my car so I could return home. I will drive myself to San Ysidro and cross with the sentri card. They will cross in Otay and meet me in San Ysidro.

Today we also talked about that night. The sunday I slept with Catherine and talked drunk after having sex. I told her I loved her. I do. I know it. I don't doubt it. She told what I also said.

"After that, yeah, I felt this butterflies in my stomach. But I freaked out a little. It was more about what you said later. I haven't mentioned it."

I didn't know what else I said. She had told me about how I kept playing with jhonny about having sex. Was I teasing him? Didn't I really care? I can't remember that just as I can't remember me saying

"I want to have... ok, adopt, little babies", with a playful, childish and almost unconscious smile.

## 2016-03-10

Today we had sex. A thousand times I've said that I won't be able to have children. Yesterday we talked about how I said in a drunken state of consciousness how I'd be willing to have, or, more like, adopt children with her.

My father woke me up at 5:30 in the morning. The bathroom was ready. I shaved part of my chest and cleaned my hair. I put on pants and shaved my face with the double edged razor. It was close enough. I didn't put neither the bra nor the t-shirt. I went downstairs to my room with both my pajama pants and the clothes I'd wear today in my arms. In my room I had to lock the door so Luis wouldn't enter and see me. I painted my face and put mousse on my hair. Just a little black in my eyes and something to cover my facial hair.

Then I exited. Catherine and Anahi were already 20 persons behind crossing. I was in my car 5 minutes before the time I had to be leaving. There was traffic down the 5&10. I got into the gas station and went another way. There was some traffic too getting down the Americas. Down to the boulevard there was a full-stop. A couple more minutes in the 20 de noviembre neighborhood. After getting in to the freeway there was no more traffic. I parked the car and actually ran to the line. I showed my sentri card and got in the building. I kept walking until I stood a couple of persons behind the counter. Again the border officer held my card at the same lever of my face to corroborate my image. This time he didn't say anything. "Yes, it's you" He mumbled something I didn't get. "Your bag, what do you bring from Mexico" "Nothing."

I waited for Catherine and Anahi to come pick me up in the Jack in the box.

Anahi drove us to the Zoo. We got in there on time. We actually were early. We waited until some other people arrived.

How did they see me? There was someone who called us ladies. This time Catherine and Anahi weren't in front. If he didn't see the three of us, then he saw me with Anahi. I wanted to go to the bathroom. My underwear was uncomfortable. Where should I go? Partially blending is not really a solution. It has its own drawbacks. Getting in to the men's one would be admitting failure. The women's was overconfidence.

I waited. The next time we stopped, when Anahi did enter, I asked Catherine. "Which one should I use?" "You don't look girly girly", she admitted with a worried look on her face. I couldn't hear the rest of it. Her words were silent. I just caught her personification of manly man. "You are not a manly man". I don't care about extremes. I just want to avoid this ambiguity.

I can't remember now much of the zoo. We saw some animals, we went into the sky boxes thingies.

I wanted fish & chips, but the food was really expensive. It would be better for us to eat somewhere else. In n out? Chipotle?

"los llevo" "morros" "mamon". Why would those hurt me? She told Catherine she sees me as a woman. She calls me Sofia. I have seen the picture. She has me by that name in her phone. She's sincere. They're just mistakes, slips of tongue. Why do they hurt? I feel so pathetic worrying and hurting about that nonsense.

She drove us to the border and we walked towards my car. I used the men's room and she the women's. There was just one bathroom.

We could go fucking. We could go to the movies, too. We stopped in the Love boutique near my house. The lady in the cashier welcomed us with doubt. How did she end her word? "Bienvenid..." and then a whisper. Is it their voices that goes off or is it my ears that shut?

"Cualquier cosa diganme, reinas", said the older woman by her side. I didn't want to turn. I didn't want to face her. I liked being noticed, called like this. I don't want them to correct themselves. I don't want to correct them a third time. I've never done that.

In the motel I finished four times. The condom slipped and ended up inside of her. We were nervous, a little scared. I drove her to the pharmacy and bought an emergency pill.

My blue bra is damned. Everytime that I would use it, I wasn't able to show it to her. And then, today that we actually went to a motel, the condom slips. And after leaving, I think I forgot it. It wasn't until we were outside her house when I looked for her camera in my bag that I had to move it. I had put it in. I still have it.

We did what we had to. She took the pill. Now we just have to wait. Let her period come. She had her last between the 20th and 24th. Two weeks until the next one.

Two weeks and I can stop worrying about that. Two weeks after that and I'll worry about going to my appointment.

## 2016-03-11

I asked Cahterine to go to the university today. I could had gone alone. Nothing impeded me. Why didn't I go by myself? I stayed in bed. I slept the hours I lacked yesterday. I enjoyed my free time in bed, the warm between my sheets, the softness of my pillows, the rest in my muted thoughts.

This morning I did broke fast eating a bowl of cereal. The sweetness of the food was something new. A couple hours later I ate a sandwich and some chips. I watched several episodes of House of Cards. From bed to the couch. Walking nothing more than the necessary. My legs still hurt from yesterday's trip. The photos finished uploading. Even the videos are now in my computer. I could spend some time organizing most of them. Seeing them.

Catherine and Anahi published several on the internet.

"Is it bad that I'm a little annoyed with Anahi?" Catherine asked me a little ago. Yesterday in the Zoo Anahi avoided the camera, made faces when we still shoot at her. I kept doing it. I don't mind she doesn't like them. I want them for me. Still, when I got home, the first thing she did was ask us for the pictures we take. The contradiction made Catherine feel uneasy. I've gotten used to it, I guess. I noticed it, but didn't mind.

I like the pictures of that day, the ones from the day before. I like looking at me. Seeing me smile. I feel a little as if I want to share them, show them to my friends, post them on Facebook and let the world see me, see how I'm able to smile and be happy. I want to look at me, to notice me. I guess that's why I feel sad when I do post them and almost nobody notices them. There is no reaction. Nobody cares, why would they?

Why haven't I told my dad? The graduation has passed. It's not his reaction that I fear, it's not his face either. It's not his disappointment nor anger. It's not even his pain. What is it that scares me?

I don't know how to say it.

Yes, I do.

"Dad, I'm trans". That's what I have to say. Anything else is just an explanation. I can ease into it. I know that, too. Bring the topic up: "Have you seen that they're now the Wachowski sisters?". Let him talk about it. If he's supportive just say it. If he's not, say it even with more reason. "Everyone can be. Most of the people would never now".

I know what to say. I don't fear the reaction anymore. I just don't know how. How can I get close? How can I bring it up?

I told Catherine how I felt when I was in her house the last time. Being called Ivan, hearing the same old joke about that name.

Her mother invited me to the wedding of one of her friends. She hadn't told me about it. She didn't know if she should. How would I feel? Would I go?

I was honest with her. I'm not thrilled with the idea. I don't want to wear a suit. Introduce myself in that name. Play that role again. She understands. She knows. "It's just that, it was the first time that my mother mentioned taking you somewhere".

It was, except it wasn't. She wasn't inviting me. They don't know me.

Not even my parents know me. It's not fair to give Catherine pressure to do something when I can't even make myself open up. My parents are now alone in the kitchen. I don't even bother anymore making me feel guilty about the passed opportunities. I won't do it soon. I don't know what I am waiting for. Whenever they see something or ask about something will I admit it?

There are pictures of me in my computer, clothes of mine in my room. There is make up in my shelf. There is profiles with my picture and name online. What will happen when the wrong person finds them and says something? What when my aunts notice my name change in snapchat? What will I do when I meet Jessica and or her parents in the movies or when somebody who knows my mother recognizes me with the wrong clothes walking to my therapy?

What will happen when I make the appointment and finally go to the laser place. Will I tell them before? Will I tell them after? Will I answer truthfully when they will ask me?

Will I lie?

Will I ever be able to stop lying?

## 2016-03-12

Tomorrow I'll run a 5km race. It will be like the first date I went with Catherine three years ago. Now, everyone of us but Anahi will be there. Colors, water, running. I have the clothes ready in my bed. I asked Luis for a white t-shirt.

I got distracted. I was chatting with Catherine and Anahi. Anahi asked me where was Catherine, if I was with her. She's in a wedding. She did invite me. I decided not to go. I didn't want to wear a suit and meet people. I don't want to dance I don't want to be around people and feel invisible and hidden.

Ironically I was just talking with Anahi about going somewhere to dance. She doesn't know about any place and neither do I. After I mentioned our conversation to Catherine, she told me she doesn't know either. I think about the differences between dancing clubs and bars. I like the latter, but the former make me nervous. I think about the line that forms outside the door. The security men with their chains who decide who enters and who doesn't. How would I dress? They would look at my clothes, judge me, evaluate me. Am I formal enough? What would happen if I decided to go differently? Would I obliged to wear pants and shoes and a shirt?

Would I be mocked when I showed my id to those people? Do I have to go as a man? Would I dare going as something else?

Rene told me last session he should be starting with my report. If I wanted something special. What could I ask him to write? Does he really think the treatment is the right thing for me? I know it is. I know I am convinced. But is he on the same page as me? Do I have his total support?

I can ask him to put in what I have done, the things I've accomplished. I've told my close friends. I have a partner who knows and supports me and loves me just as I am. I've told my mother. I've gone outside several times dressed as female. I've known for years now.

Writing those things made me nervous. I feel agitated and anxious. I haven't told my dad. I haven't asked all of my friends to really acknowledge me. I haven't found a job with which I could live. I haven't started the laser sessions. I haven't told my brothers. I haven't confided in more than a handful of people.

I think about what I've done and I can't help but run towards I haven't done yet. What I'm missing, what I don't dare.

And time keeps coming, it runs and runs and it's closer than ever. Two months have passed since my birthday. Two months since I did the appointment, since I dared to make the call. Two months and nothing has happened since then. No. I'm lying.

Paolas know. Paola knows, Paola knows my name and about me. I've shared more with them. I graduated. I'm done with school.

I'm closer with Luis, I guess?

I won't tell him until I tell my dad. I think again and again how I could approach him. I go blank. My mouth is shut, my throat closed and my mind empty.

Tomorrow I'll wake up early and run. Tomorrow I'll see them. Will I say anything? What's the point in telling them more when my father is still blank?

Monday I can go to school and keep doing all the bureaucratic procedure that I left undone. I have the pictures and I've paid what I had to pay. Paola still has the book I took out for her. I need her to return it so they can give me a paper that says I don't owe anything to them.

Catherine gave me a convocation to this scholarship of community work in Colombia and Chile. I had seen it. When I gave myself the time to actually read it, something in it made me uneasy. I had to have and propose this new and creative idea of something that could help the community. Do a video of me selling it and promoting it.

I gave up without even trying.

I should be studying, preparing for my own goal. I haven't opened any of the books I should be reading.

I must call to the laser place. Catherine is right. Is just a consult. Asking about prices and terms. I'm not signing anything. I'm just asking. I can do that and then talk about my parents. Why do I keep feeling I'm hiding it from them. That I'm betraying them.

I can tell them that I went and asked. I want to do this.

"Why?"

Because I don't like how I look with facial hair. I don't like looking like a man. I don't like being a man...

And then just take the jump. Close my eyes and take that leap of faith. In the air, it doesn't matter the coldness of the water or the frozen punch of the fall. There's nothing left to do but embrace it.

## 2016-03-13

My eyes are heavy and tired. They are aching for closing and rest. My whole body is restless. I turn and see my bed and I'm filled with this sense of longing. The desire to crawl to there, hid under the sheets and turn off the lights is almost unbearable.

Yesterday I turned off the setting of my cellphone which automatically sets the time and date with the data sent by my cell provider and/or the information on the internet. Manually, I set the summer time schedule. I fell asleep somewhere between one and three. A couple of hours later the alarm started vibrating and singing. Catherine had asked me to call her whenever I woke up so she wouldn't stay asleep. A big six was in the dimmed screen of my phone. Was a text message enough? Must I actually call her? I did both. She was asleep, her phone marked 5 in the morning.

I went upstairs and grabbed a towel before entering the bathroom. Yesterday I discarded the idea of wearing a bra. I would sweat. It would look. Nobody would know me so I didn't really care about it. I still decided not to wear it. I shaved yesterday, too, so I wouldn't have to this morning. It was stupid to think of hiding my beard with make up. Why? I would run, I would sweat.

My phone did change its own time. It set ahead another hour. I slept an hour less than I should had. I woke Catherine an hour before we both should had risen.

I have been writing her in english for almost more than two hundred days. All of those days in english. I type a quarter of a thousand words daily in 20 minutes. And yet, I still feel judged. Catherine is nervous about speaking it. Her pronunciation bothers her. She feels that every mistake she might have will scream and point at her face. I know that feeling. The whole purpose of this exercise is to write, without censor nor editing. I should type my thoughts as they come. I should let everything slide, stop caring about syntax or orthography or grammar. And yet, here I am, writing a whole paragraph, again about her.

There is this little voice that speaks what I write. Every word sounds in my head as I see it being formed in my screen. The voice is not mine nor someone else's. It's not a personal voice. Sometimes it's male, others female. I don't really care. That voice is not the one that bothers me. It's that phantom ear in the back. That ear who listens and judges. The one ghost who is evaluating, looking for a mistake. No, it doesn't need to actually look. Mistakes are like little cockroaches moving when the lights turn to its sight. They escape and run and be as obvious as shooting stars in a dark night. And the ghosts notices, and marks them. The ghost speaks and judges. And then it stays, looking, hearing. Speechless, faceless.

"Who is the girl from the graduation that looks like Monica?" "The tall one".

We arrived first, before anyone. We were in the school, parked in the parking lot in front of the sports faculty one. We were early enough to actually receive t-shirts. There were only Large ones when it was our turn. Paola and I just received X-Large.

The race began. Catherine and I finished. Last.

Any other day I would had felt her. She would had been a burden. Maybe I would even hate her for bringing me with her. Making me be the last one. She wasn't forcing me, actually. Several times she offered, almost asked me to run. Run, go ahead. Any other day I wouldn't dare. I would had stayed and resented her still.

Today I stayed. But I didn't resent her, nor felt burdened. Today I wanted to hug her. I wanted to be by her side. What would be the point to go ahead, to meet Paolas or actually get to Chevo and Jessica's position. So what if I would end up being the first of the group to finish? I would win, maybe. But I'd be alone. Worse than that. I would had left her alone again

I didn't even think about that. In my head there was no option but walking besides her. I felt just as good finishing with her as I would had felt if I were the first one.

We ate with the rest of them. Paola didn't took the book with her. I might ask her about picking it up from her house. I need to return it before asking for the no-debt paper.

Why do I feel this, uh, pressure? Why is it hard for me to just send her a text message and ask her if I can pick it up?

Will I actually call tomorrow to set the appointment? Will I hesitate as I hesitated the day before my birthday? Will I ever tell my parents about any of those two appointments?

## 2016-03-14

I said I would wait and I did not. Just before starting typing I unplugged the headphones from the laptop and connected them to my phone. The little buzzes of the touches crawled like bugs from the cushions on my ears. There were three recordings in the screen. The top one was from this afternoon. I was narrating to myself, in some kind of journal entry way, how Anahi was talking to me about her crush asking her out.

For the first time I felt like somebody's best friend.

No, that's not fair. I've had best friends before. Is this what has happened with other things? Does every love feels like the first one? Does the current love seems like the best one? I was best friend of Catherine before we were a couple. I went with her to the motel as a best friend. I confided in her with a girl friend. I loved her as a friend. And before her there was Monica. We were not lovers or a couple until leaving high school. All the moments before then we were friends. She was the best one I had until then.

This time I felt required, solicited.

Today was just like yesterday. Again my phone skipped ahead an hour. The alarm broke the silent darkness of slumber an hour before it should. Catherine sent me a text saying her mother had left her near the border and she would wait just a little. There were no sounds in my home. Nobody had risen. What if they would not leave? I started being nervous, getting agitated with anxiety. Time seemed to pass so fast. I didn't notice the moment my father left with Miguel. Then, it was my mother's and Luis arguments as every other morning.

After they left, Catherine told me she would be leaving downtown. She'd text me when she were on the boulevard so I could meet her in the Burger King.

There was not as much traffic as I thought it would be. I texted her my location when I waited for the red light to turn green for the third time. From the gas station I estimated a time of arrival of 10 minutes. When I realized I had no data and decided to send it as a normal text message instead I realized it would not take me 10 minutes so I wrote 2 instead in the correction a minute later. Another minute later I was just outside the parking lot waiting for an altisa van to move.

I brought her home in my pijama. I was tired. Maybe I'm still am. As soon as we entered my room I got under my sheets. Paola had answered my message but Catherine continued the conversation in my place. She returned the book and sent Catherine a picture of the stamp.

After the university she had an appointment with the pediatrician. "For her or Diego?" I asked jokingly. She wrote it as "Sofi says".
"Then who is this?" And she explained it. I would read the conversation later when I drove Catherine home and read the first message of Anahi asking me if I were there. "How is it that whenever I need you you are not here?"

We hugged. I asked her if I could take my pants off. Why do I want to sleep in my underwear when I lie by her side? I love the sensation of my bare legs surrounding her. It was an innocent request. Yesterday she had asked me if she brought anything. No. I was not in the mood.

We did end up fucking. She touched me and I touched her. I made her finish after she did me. She put herself on top of me. After I put on the condom she slide me into herself and rode me. I came inside of her. This time the condom did not slip.

We fell asleep. I know I dreamed something but even just waking up I could not remember any of it. What could it had been about? I don't even remember the sensation it gave me.

After waking up we tried again. Now she slide her finger inside of me. Neither of us came this time. It was nice though.

Was it the first time or the second when the phone rang? Was it mine first or hers?

Hers she answered after several rings and checking that the number was known. "Good-bye" said a creepy woman's voice before hanging up.

Mine was an unknown number but not marked as Telcel. It, actually, was a man's name the one which appeared in the application that lets me block them. I answered and it was a lady. "Hello, with whom do you want to speak?" "Hi, miss, I'm from Telcel". I hung up.

She called me miss.

That was the reason I recorded myself again. This time I heard it with hearphones even though I wondered if I could wait. It was, weird. It doesn't sound feminine. It sounds a bit fake. I couldn't even hear it whole. I checked with the older one and the voice doesn't change much.

Would I call me miss if I heard that voice?

We got ready for school. I applied make up. Nobody called me any way. We paid the kardex. We made the appointment for the papers. It will be the 28th of this month. We met with Jhonny in the faculty and paid for my ticket for his show this Wednesday. Tomorrow I was supposed to pick the kardex but there will not be any labors. I can pick it up wednesday after therapy and before buying my pills.

I didn't make the appointment with the laser place. I didn't mention it to my parents either.

For being one who whines about waiting a lot, I really do not know what is it for that I make myself wait before telling my parents.

## 2016-03-15

There were a lot of messages when I grabbed my phone in the early morning. There had not passed more than half an hour since my mom and Luis left the house. Anahi, Catherine, and the conversation with the two of them. Anahi sent me several messages just to me. Her crush had asked her about a date. What could she do? What could she answer?

The whole morning I spent it in bed, under the sheets, trying to sleep and chatting with her. Catherine told us she was already in school. Later she was on her break. Anahi was asked where would she want to go. At what time. I helped her with her clothes and her hair. What shade could she use on her lips? Did her blouse look too transparent? Was it weird that he asked her to meet in Target?

After noon. No, it was 11 o'clock when I returned to bed. I was so tired and my eyes felt so heavy. I just put the alarm two hours later and shut my eyes. I turned off the alarm two times and got up at 3 in the afternoon. I ate saturday's breakfast in the morning and waited until 5pm to heat some chicken and potatoes. I was half through my plate when my mother called home. The phone was off. I ran upstairs and answered the one in my parents' room. I redialed her number. Luis answered.

"Miguel" he thought I was. I didn't fake the voice this time. I sound like him. Both my dad and my mom ask who is talking because they can't tell us apart. I hear him declare "I'm Miguel", several times too.

How did I talk yesterday when the Telcel lady heard me?

Minutes after they came with food from the Carl's jr, both my dad and Miguel entered the door. He has been going to the gym. Will he bulk up? Lean down? I can't remember the last time I saw him thin. He used to wear the same size I did. He was a Medium adult. He is now XLarge. I've stayed medium. I'm wearing now one of his shirts that he gave me. It still smells like Catherine. It's the one she wore when she slept in my bed.

Yesterday night I sent my resume to the job organization of the university. I see lots of reviews saying they got them a job. Maybe they will find something for me. Maybe they will ignore me, too...

As soon as my dad entered the house I told him they would show an animated film about food rated R. I showed him the video of my phone.

I don't see myself standing up to him and saying "I'm trans".

The first days I wondered about writing a letter. Two years ago I typed a long, repetitive e-mail that I would sent to the both of them. I deleted a couple days later. No. I discarded the idea but the document might still exist. I wouldn't use it anyway. It was maybe three or five pages long.

I could do it in a page. A lot has happened since then. I'm treated by my depression now. He knows that, but still I could use it as an anchor point.

He knows I take antidepressants.

He knows nothing else.

"I've been wanting to tell you something since a long time. I really don't know why it's so hard for me to open up with you.
It's been weeks since I've tried to muster up the courage to talk to you. But I can't find my voice, I can't find my words.
So I decided to write them. If I can't tell you, at least I'll show you.

It was hard for me to tell you I take antidepressants. I never told you the years before that I was depressed. I've never told you things.
I'm sorry. Even when I told you I was taking it, I couldn't describe the reason why.

I don't like my body. I don't like how I look. I don't like being a man. It feels wrong. It has felt wrong all my life.

I am not a man.

I am trans.

I am sure you know what that means..."

I can't. I thought I could, but no, I can't.

My mind goes blank. The words tangle up and explode and hide. The thoughts run loose and the emotions blow up like a grenade.

It's more hard than I thought it would be.

Even pretending, even rehearsing, I can't do it.

## 2016-03-16

I was supposed to wear something neutral today. I woke up and answered Catherine text messages. I had to turn off the alarms because I had no energy to wake up. I swallowed the two last pills in a dry gulp. I painted my face. I showered and shaved. I'm wearing black jeans and a red sweater. I walked the same path of every wednesday. I stopped in the Oxxo and bought a lemon beverage so I could break a 100 note. The cashier just looked at me and smiled politely. Nobody said anything. I looked at myself in the reflection of the building and it was nothing out of the ordinary.

I waited the fifteen minutes I was early sitting in the stairs of the last floor. I sent a snap to Chevo and paolas and Catherine and anahi. I wanted to see me. I finally played the doorbell and waited for Rene to come for me. He was alone.

The first part of the session I talked about how I can't dare to tell my parents. What is it that stop me from telling my dad. It's not his reaction, not that I don't know what to say. I'm scared of standing in front of him void of words. I'm afraid of the silent expectancy, of being naked and vulnerable in his eyes.

Then, he asked me since when everything started. I could tell his question was so he could gather the information he needs for the report. He hasn't started, or maybe he did. He confirmed the date of my appointment. "The seventh..." The other third quarters of the session I spent them talking, narrating the story and development of all this.

His question trying to discredit the differential diagnosis of a transvestite fetishism hurt me. I know it's not just sexual excitation. It's not a sexual desire. I have it more than clear.

I wear the clothes, I use that name. Even with the daily use of the antidepressants and the lower sexual desire. I have come from masturbating daily to doing it every other week, if even.

From his office I drove to the pharmacy near the university. I stopped in the parking lot and entered the building. I had the prescription and the wallet in my hand. I took off my sunglasses and held them in the other hand. I was almost blind when I gave the pharmacist my prescription.

Hello. Could you give me two bottles? Thank you.

She asked me if I had a card. I declined and then remember. "Oh, yeah, yes I do". The three of us smiled. Silly mistake.

"Could you attend the miss?" Said the one who had my prescription to the other one in the cashier.

I saved all the notes and the bottles and the prescription and my card. Everything set I drove towards the school. It was early still. The guard from the parking lot let me pass with just a wave of the hand. Does he know me? Does he recognize me?

The building of offices had all of its lights turned out. There were 5 minutes still to their return. I walked around the campus. I tried to get the wifi signal but it kept bouncing off my phone. I saw some familiar faces. Nobody who could recognize me. I walked around looking for a place to sit in a shadow. There was none.

I return to the offices and there was a line already. I stood in it, waiting. There was a little kid, maybe two or three years old. He had blue or green eyes and a soda bottle in his hands. His back was covered in a brown monkey backpack.

The three people in front of me were waiting for the other window. When I finally got to the clerk I asked him about my kardex. He asked for my name and started looking.

"My classmate couldn't come, can I take hers, too?" "If it's here, sure"

I said Catherine's lastname and he corrected me "First yours".

He was looking for Fernandez. He asked me if I was a graduate. He used the neutral, male form. Maybe it was my voice, maybe he saw through me.

He didn't find the kardex and asked my to write my name, program and number in a yellow post it. I wrote Catherine's too. Maybe he looked for a female name? I was waiting for that. "Ivan? Is this you?" "I thought you were a woman".

No.

The girl standing next to the door came with the papers. He signed them and gave them to me.

Luis and my mother arrived a couple of minutes ago. I was just painting my face again. They didn't notice. I let my eyes the same.

"You look pretty" Luis told me in a mocking way. "That's rude" my mother reprimanded him. He clarified he was talking about how a woman in my grad told me I looked pretty. "I'm just joking... or am I?"

I returned to my room and finished my eyes. Catherine sent me a text saying she was on her way.

We'll see jhonny's show.



## 2016-03-17

Anahi sent a post to the group of the seven team. The one where we are all signed up from years ago. We all were in the school. We all went to the congress. It was fourth semester. Before Anahi dropped out, before Paola got pregnant and dropped out, too, before Catherine and me went out of the country. It was before I broke up with Monica and before everything of mine came up.

Those were simpler times.

I think about fake times, like a fantasy bubble. A facade blinding us. Pretending we were living the time of our lives. No, I was pretending I was living.

My relationship was a mess and I refused to see it. My own persona was breaking. The repressed things were boiling inside and the shell was breaking. I was fake with "my friends". They knew nothing about me. They barely do now.

One by one were leaving. First it was Anahi. Paola was the one who saw through the lies. She left. Paola got isolated in a different group. Me and Catherine just left. I died in Spain and returned as a shadow. One by one we started realizing we were not this perfect group of loving friends. We paraded a lie. We celebrated a fake ribbon.

Anahi realized it when we didn't looked for her after her accident. I had my reasons stupid as they were. I don't know theirs. Catherine looked for her and was responded by apathy and indifference.

Then we started getting back together. First I looked for Catherine and she helped me get in peace with myself. From there, I opened up to Chevo and Jessica. Then it was Paola, and then the other.

By my own account I looked for Anahi, too. She's been talking with me about her crush. I felt as her real best friend. It was nice.
Meeting with Paola, the last one which I told, she kept repeating about this team, this group of friends. I was surprised by the way Anahi opened up to her and met her and talked as if years hadn't passed by.

On our own way, she confessed us how she wanted to correct her, eliminate this idea of hers that we're all still friends, this fantastical team.

And now here was her post. No... even before that. There were comments on memories. The first time we all went out. Maybe it were the pictures of the color run. Maybe she saw them, all of us posting them and celebrating. After that day, she came with the comments. Then told us about how she answered back to a snap of Eusebio. And today finally was her post.

All this talk about closure she asked for a meeting, seeing us all together. Maybe that first coffee to which we went the first time. Argana. She was answered by emotion and excitement. I was filled with doubt. Everyone kept asking about a time or place, getting organized. All but Catherine and me posted.

Catherine was going to meet Miguel that day. She's not excited to meeting them.

Before that Anahi asked us to see the batman and superman movie. We could wear superman and batman t-shirts. Catherine could wear one of wonder woman. Wonder woman, like the character which my mother's cousin liked to play as. Anahi would be team batman so I would wear a superman one. I know Miguel had one. I remember seeing him with it. Was it a long time ago? Did he give it to me? I don't have it. Maybe it was in his closet. I went to see.

I saw his open drawer and remember that time that I found a pair of panties reeking of semen. They were hidden in a camera pouch that was actually mine. Was the underwear my mothers? Did he do the same thing I did? Was he like me? I panicked and left it there.
So this time I opened them looking for something, expecting what I would find. When I saw the pillowcase at the back I didn't have to open it to know what it hid. Instead of one pair there were like five. I didn't smell anything.

Does he masturbate with them? I know he locks the door. Does he wear them? Does he just touches himself with them?

I know it's a common fetish. I want it to be a fetish. I wouldn't know how to take it otherwise.

I'm scared of telling my parents. Was Catherine right when she asked if it scared me of other one saying it first?

No. I'm scared of not being the only one. Of being blamed.

## 2016-03-18

In a couple of hours Catherine will arrive for me. We will eat and then watch a Tango concert in the CECUT. We bought the tickets the day before yesterday before Miguel arrived to watch Jhonny's show. Yesterday I couldn't decide what to wear today. I thought about the leggings and a blouse. Catherine proposed me to wear the blue one I wore in the pride. Two days ago I asked her if I could wear a dress. Why did I want to wear one? I haven't worn the gray one I bought since we went to the beach months ago. Was it last year?

The other one, the first one she gave me I haven't worn it since one of the times in the motel, more than a year ago.

So I had several options. It was all about trying em today in the morning. And so I did.

I woke up with the usual sounds in the morning. I had different dreams. In one I remember looking at my hand, the lines that are drawn by its age and reading Monica's name. It was like a Facebook status. I was surprised by it, it had a text. The next time that I looked at my hand it was gone. I tried to read from it but it had lost all meaning.

The next dream, that is fading right now as I try to recall it, it was about a game? No. I was in Mexicali. Something like that. I remember a house from there. Sleeping, beds. Something about my grandmother?

I was in my house. We were playing a game like Monopoly. My father and I. Were somebody else playing, too? I had rolled the dice and it was one. When I tried to move my piece it was gone? Where was I set? How could I move? Somebody had misplaced it. My father was winning. I had no properties. No, I did, one, maybe two... He had like three monopolies. I was sad, upset. I told him I didn't want to play anymore. There was no point, I didn't know where I was. He was a little upset. My uncle was there with him. Everyone talked about me. A sore loser, a brat. They judged me. I decided to put the game away. The board was big and heavy, like a mat or a rug. I wanted to folded but, no matter how I tried, I didn't get it right. Defeated, I went to lie down on the couch. I used it as a cover and put it over me. It was so heavy I could not move. It pushed me down against the couch. Every intent of moving was harder than the last.

And I woke up. It was an hour before noon and yet I was restless. I put an alarm half an hour later but ended up turning it off..

I ate breakfast and watched some tv. I tried one the blue blouse but it's wrinkles annoyed me. I saw my arms huge. I saw the dress in my closet and decided to try it on. I put it and then this black cardigan over it. I looked at my reflection and liked it. Even the black betraying spots on my face didn't bother me much. I took a picture and sent it to Catherine. Just now she saw it. She took a screenshot. I took another one and sent it to her. To Anahi and Paolas and even Chevo, too.

Is it possible that those kind of pictures make them uncomfortable?

Catherine, in the morning, told me how she would not go to the day at the beach that Anahi was planning with them. She sent the conversation to Miguel but he didn't answer. I can understand that. It seems unfair, I know.

She actually asked them, it was ok to take a male guest.

"Yeah, you can bring Ivan" Answered back Jessica. "A MALE guest, Miguel... Sofia is part of the package" Jessica knew. It was a joke. She told her to ask Anahi, but for everyone else it was cool.

She used that name, she defended me. Jessica is the only one who hadn't heard it before. Chevo, maybe, although he has me on Twitter. Both Anahi and Paola recognized me from the picture and name. It's foolish to think Chevo didn't too.

"I added you, already" He said, and yet he had not. He followed me until after I did.

In 40 minutes Catherine will leave her house and come for me.

Ever since the shower I've felt my heart rush. Is it the medication, maybe? I've been thinking about going to my dad. I decided to apply make up even though I asked Catherine for her lipstick. Do I want to be found? Do I want to be cornered and forced to say out loud?

If I don't say it, soon, I fear I'll be betrayed by my own unconscious self.

## 2016-03-19

There were dreams today but I've already forgotten.

Luis woke me up with his breakfast sounds. It was early, like 8 o clock and my door was open. Yesterday before falling asleep... no, it was before that...

I wrote yesterday's words before Catherine picked me up. We ate in the pomodoro restaurant. From there, we parked in the River Plaza. She bought an oreo milk popsicle and I, a glass of sangria. We waited and took pictures and talked. The car was parked near the food garden. In there we chatted about the thought of having kids. I remember her doubts and insecurities about her wants. After last trip to the motel and the slipped condom and the day after pill, we both gave the idea a recap. She do wants them. Because of her, her own motivation and needs, not her parents.

I want them, too. I like the idea of a little child. I am scared. I am scared of that little person growing and resenting me. I am afraid of the people's sights and judgements. In the morning Jessica had made that joke about me being Catherine's guest. She corrected her. We mentioned that, too.

"I didn't tell you, did I?... I was talking with Chevo, when he sent us the picture of his conversation with the empty group. He told me something, I can't remember what we were talking about, but he said 'like the colored people, as Sofia would say' ".

He used the name. I had just told her how I didn't identify what Jessica's exchange made me feel. She said how she was a little upset, but Jessica didn't know the name. She wrote, no she thought of telling her "I've told you, she is not a man to me. She is a woman." and yet again, how could she write I am part of the package? "Don't call her Ivan. Ivan's always included".

And so, she wrote Sofi, as if she had known.

After the anecdote about Chevo and realizing that. Late at night I wrote them. I told them about the name. I wrote a little letter in a new conversation in whatsapp. The didn't see it until today's morning. And that was the first thing I saw when I opened my eyes and reached the phone.

Their answers. They had heard it but didn't want to ask. They were waiting for me to tell them. Something was left vague, though, did I want for them to use the name or not?

I covered myself in the sheets and muted a scream with the pillow. I was anguished. What had I done? Why? How could I ever tell my dad if even with them that they know it's a disaster?

After a couple of breaths I answered with the same nonchalantic manner. Yes, fuck it. Use it. It would mean a lot to me. I repeated them the offer of asking whatever they want. I gave them some ideas.

After the shower we drove to the united states. I offered the idea of eating in the In N out. We all ate outside in the table I could save.

All day I had the words stuck in my chest. I could feel them moving with every breath. They were burning me. Nothing stopped me from saying it. In the freeway on our way home I even mouthed them silently with my lips as if I were rehearsing the movements needed.

"I want to go and ask how much they would charge me for getting rid of my facial hair".

Of what was I afraid? Of course I know. Because it means of saying the rest, too. Even Rene told me. "They will ask you why".

Yeah, it's right. And I know, with that little push I'll let everything out.

Even Luis asked me if I were going to look for clothes. "No, I don't like men's clothes". We looked for the t-shirts. I found one of Superman and a large one of Batman. I asked Anahi if she had bought them. She told me no. I could buy hers and let her pay me later.

We found a couple of sweatshirts. They were short-sleeved and a little shorter on the front than on the back. They were longish and yet slim. I liked them. There were some red ones. Luis liked them, too. After looking a little I found some gray ones, too. On the other end there was a blue thin one. It was Large so I suspected it was women's. I grabbed it, still. I liked it.

After a while I noticed it was too feminine so I left it.

I almost run out of soap so I need to buy some from Amazon. I saw some bags that I liked and a little leather wallet, the most expensive item that I absolutely loved.

Anahi told me a story about her. Some pictures she saved and kept. She wanted to give me and Catherine an album of us. It would had been amazing. But we grew apart. She thought about ripping them apart.

I felt sad and wanted to hug her and apologize.

We will print a picture of ours to Catherine.

## 2016-03-20

It's just barely past midnight and yet I got this urge to write. Why? It's the earliest I've written yet.

I had this sudden low.

I was organizing the pictures. Since the graduation I hadn't moved them. They were a mess. The dates, the times, they were all misplaced. And I looked through them. One by one, searched its place according to the rest, measuring the time when it should had taken place.

Since the graduation, firsts of march, to yesterday. I've put all of them on their place now. They are all set. I went back to see if I deleted all of the excessive ones. I can't tell.

The software kept crashing over and over. It always reopened on the same picture of me with red lips smiling to the camera in the food garden. I just had told Catherine how I liked the way I looked. Did it change? Did I change?

"Did the picture change or did my eyes?" Said the last twit I posted on Sofia's account. I had just changed the display picture...

Yolanda kept telling Catherine how she was narrating what happened and yet spoke about nothing at all. I feel, or realize just now how I am actually doing that just now. I opened this window to type how I feel. I could have told the moment that I noticed Yolanda's position. She's looking for someone to be her secretary. A student, she can liberate professional practice or social service. I could call her and ask her. The time is ok. 4 hours sitting on her office taking calls and doing her scheduling.

Catherine told me to call and ask. I couldn't. I was paralized.

"What is Catherine studying? ... Her mother told us, how she wasn't losing her year. She actually made me think how we let you do nothing".

My father asked me if I kept contacting or received notice of the school. I should call and ask.

I had told Catherine how I didn't feel their pressure. And today it was apparent. Why didn't I write about that? Didn't I remember?
Just now I feel like crying.

All day I had been with an euthymic mood. Joking, talking... What happened this moments?

I looked the pictures of a year ago. I have changed. I don't look the same. In some I look more feminine. Yet, it's not enough. And then I think of Chevo and Jessica. I asked them. It may be hard but nothing that they can't get accustomed to.

In three weeks I'll have an appointment with the endocrinologist. He will ask me questions and prescribe me some tests.

My father is just leaving to pick Miguel up. I should tell them. Mention the laser, do something. I want to scream it.

I feel so pathetic. I wanted to change before I telling them. I wanted to see me and just go like "oh, yeah you already look like a woman, I guess it's natural". It hurts me, saying it, how I feel like something and yet look entirely different.

Am I scared? Am I angry? Am I alive?

Am I anything?

What am I? Who am I?

I'm tired. I want to lie down and cry a little. I look at the pictures. I look attractive. I sent one to my aunt. A picture of me and Luis. "Handsome boys". I looked better than him. He looks handsome, thin and tall, with an athletic fit. His face is the one of a pubescent boy. My body is fuller and less formed and yet my face is softer, more defined. I looked like a handsome man.

I am not one. I don't want to be.

The picture I put in Twitter I looked feminine. The clothes don't look out of the ordinary. My face is softened by the make up and my eyes defined by the blackness of its surroundings. My face is contoured by my dark falling locks. There is an almost imperceptible trace of shadow around my lips and yet it's almost invisible. My factions doesn't scream male. But Catherine is right. There is something there, something that makes you doubt. Like an essence. Or a stink.

Luis said again "woman". "Pretty".

I made some comments about body hair, like forcing me to blurt out the laser appointment. Chest haired man. "I am not one", it's true, I don't have chest hair. He corrected himself: Chest haired woman".

He's wrong. I know it and feel it.

But where? I don't have chest hair, except I do.

I am not a woman, except I am.

## 2016-03-21

I don't know what I have done wrong.

I feel this immense guilt as if I had done something terrible. Yesterday, the day before, I stayed up and did the words of the next day. Yesterday? Yesterday we went to Mexicali. The day before we had gone to the United States. I was fine, I was playful and cheerful. I could see in me the initiative to actually say it, to tell my dad. Something late at night made me feel different.

I went to bed and dreamed. Dreamed about driving at night in the college. Then it was a party in my own home. Before that I walked to the picture with a cane and I hid it behind my back as I smiled. In the party my mother asked me about jobs. Mariana from the hospital was there. I screamed at my mother. She wasn't understanding me. There was this pressure. "You told me, promised me that the place where I'd do my internship would ask me to stay. They did not."

I waited outside. My father was just arriving home. And I did not say anything. I wanted to meet him and tell him. He went straight to the door. Mariana and her boyfriend said their good-byes.

Yesterday I know I dreamed something but I can't remember it. There was a dream in the conversation with Catherine but that I can't recall either. Something about my mother and grandma? Yeah. I was sick and lying in bed.

I feel like I wrote it before.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. He asked me to change our appointment. I was at the beach with them, no, at the Oxxo, when I read his message. 'Sofia' he wrote to me as usual. It felt as jab, a stab in the abdomen. It was fake. No, I was.

Maybe wednesday we'll go to the universal studios. No, we'll cross but wait there for the next day. Thursday is the day of Catherine's surgery.

I asked her if she wanted me to stay. She didn't answer. Anahi had offered her help moving her furniture. She denied it because her mother would help her. She was considering mine.

I was trapped. If I went, I'd be leaving her alone and wouldn't be able to enjoy the trip with my family. If I stayed, she wouldn't even note my presence and I would leave my family without me again. I wanted to split into two so I could be with both of them. And again I felt this rage inside of me. I have all the time of the world. I do absolutely nothing. My days are as empty as space and yet everything has to collapse.

I look into the mirror and see a chimera again. A mixture of ideas and wasted dreams and potential failures and what I'm not and what I could had been. It hurts me as it never hurt me before. I am a little more than two weeks to meeting the specialist and yet I feel it so distant and far away. I feel like I will never be able to escape this body. As if I will never actually meet freedom.

I talked to Anahi. Maybe too much. She attacked Catherine with questions. Why do we do intercourse if I don't like it? Does she ask me to do it?

I just told her what I was thinking and feeling. I just opened up with somebody. Why do I keep doing the wrong thing?

"Can I ask you a favor? In a month that I propose to go out all of us again, please tell me not to"

I told my mother to not go today because of this meeting. I caused the surgery dilemma so I could see them in the beach in the cold feeling like a pathetic freak wearing a blouse. Everybody knew. All of them know. It's the same. Nothing has changed. They use the name but is just that, a fucking name. It has no meaning.

"Being antisocial together [male neutral]" tagged me Anahi in a twit when I was talking to her in the teriyaki place. Even she that would later "defend" me with Catherine slips it up. She always slips in the plural.

Why do I feel like crying?

Tomorrow I won't have make up on my eyes. I can cry tomorrow. Tell everything to Rene. But what will I say?

Catherine's period came today. I was supposed to be relieved. I feel all but tranquility.

## 2016-03-22

It's really weird to type with my ears uncovered. I actually miss the pressure of the headphones on my temples.

Did we have our first fight? Was this our first? How can this be the only time it's happened when we actually stopped talking for months?

I opened up with Anahi. "How are you?" she asked like half the world does. This time I was honest and I wrote what I felt. How I actually was. She envies my family. She actually does. She has a brother and a mother and a father which she doesn't care about and a tragic memory that still haunts her.

It's the little moments and not the trips or the parties that make my family valuable. "You don't know, they could be the most inclusive people ever". And yes, they could be. Right now that I went upstairs to the bathroom I actually looked into my parents' bedroom. I listened to the idea of telling them. Telling him.

"You remember what Luis said yesterday in the crossing border? How it might be cool being a girl? I feel something like that, kind off. It's not that I want to be a girl, it's that being a boy literally hurts me. That's what depresses me, that's why I keep going to therapy and I take antidepressants. I'm not a boy. I am trans."

I feel those words in my throat as I felt the laser ones. I don't think about his reaction or even his feeling. I don't care about what would happen after, I just want that sweet relief of not hiding it anymore. I could do anything, by anyone.

I'll do it sooner rather than later.

"You can't ask me to tell my family while you haven't told yours. It's my family and I will tell them, like you, on my own time."

Was that a challenge? Of course not. Why did I take it as one?

Why am I angry? Is this anger or guilt? Do I feel guilty or sad?

Is this the depression or just failure?

Tomorrow we will leave after my mother's appointment. We will cross the border and stay in a motel. Friday Anahi and me would go visit her. I feel weird now the idea of going, seeing her. I remember the feeling of her fingers around mine, the shared warmth of her hand inside my pocket. It was undeserved. It was wrong.

How can I love her when I am wrong?

Catherine, Monica, Anahi, Carlos, Miguel, Eusebio, Jessica, Yolanda, Rene, Liliana, Paola, the other Paola. All of them know about me, about my name. My mother and hers. They know, too. They have not seen me, they might not even comprehend.

According to today's session that might be the meaning of my dream. I, lying in bed, burdened by a heavy illness. My mother escapes from the house, leaves. I screamed at her what I don't dare to mention. I wish I could leave, too. I wish I could abandon all of this, but I can't. I am the one bedridden. I have grown accustomed to talk all by myself."

She knows like me but she acts as if nothing had happened.

"I am not Ivan". I have told countless times to Luis. Why don't I dare to tell my mother I am not her son?

Because I still am.

I told Catherine I feared she would leave me if I didn't penetrate. I think we don't fool anybody when we act as if I were her girlfriend. I don't look like a woman, I don't feel like one nor sound like one. I look like a man and sound like a man and smell like a man. I touch her like a man and kiss her like a man. I don't have the body. I have this one. I can't deny her what I have to the promise of giving what I never will.

I can;t be her daughter, I can't tell Luis I am not his brother. Because I look and sound like this. I haven't change. And again I fall into this unreachable request. To change my outside I have to accept what I feel inside. But I will never accept how I feel until I change the way I look.

I don't know what will happen with Catherine. I don't know how can I save this.

I will tell my father, and then so what? And then wait to the endo? And then, what's the point of finally looking as I should if there will be nobody who really sees me?

Who cares if I finally look like one and the whole world sees me as one if the only person who could see the real me before is not here anymore?

My mother and father just arrived from their meeting in the hospital. I think I should had cheated today again. Maybe I should had just let the days pass and the streak to break. I can start again when I take the pills.

Yesterday I wanted to tell my dad. I could actually see it. I felt the words in my throat. I could spell them inside of my mouth. It wasn't a matter of if or not. It was a when. I could tell them before getting to the park. I could tell them after on our way home. I wanted to say it. I didn't even matter than Luis and Miguel were with me. I want to tell them all at the same time.

"I want to tell you something..."

I was lying in bed and closed my eyes and I could see me. I was taking my little notebook from my notebook and the pencil and just started writing in it. The page was so small that only the words needed would fit. "I don't know how to say it: I'm trans".

That's all I need to say. That's all that I want. I could say the rest, that's the thing I have to take out what I'm scared won't come, what might get stuck and asphyxiate me. After it gets out, everything else will float.

"I'm trans"

"Remember how Luis told us he might like being a woman? I feel something like that. I just hate being a man. It literally hurts me. That's why I keep going to therapy even though I graduated. That's why I take antidepressants, that's why I've been depressed most of my life. Because this body doesn't fit, it's wrong. It doesn't matter how much weight I gain or loss or how long my hair gets. It's being a man what makes me sick. I will change it. And I need you to know...

I can't keep going.

Catherine and I are not ok.

She asked me to visit her Friday, just me. I have to cancel with Anahi. I feel nervous. I'm not really sure I want to visit her. I feel she's not Catherine anymore. I feel like she were possessed. I thought it would leave me alone.

I'm scared of seeing it in her eyes. I already hear it in her words and it hurts.

Jessica asked about me. "She told me she exchanged more words with Miguel than you"

"When she told you that, did she call me Ivan?"

"Yes".

Of course. It would be hard. She would try. It's fake.

"Is everything all right?"

I nodded. Why do I keep lying?

I can't tell him like this, now. We'll leave in a moment.

I cant' keep going. I can't...

I can't... I can't...

Dad, can I talk with you? I've been meaning to tell you something since a long time ago. It's really hard. It's about my therapy. You know I'm taking antidepressants. It was hard to tell you even that. I didn't tell you why, though. I don't like my body. I've been depressed since I was little. It's been getting worse by time. I don't like how I look. I don't like being a man. I don't like looking and sounding like one. It literally hurts me. That's why I keep going to therapy even though I graduated. That's why I'm depressed and I've been taking antidepressants for almost a year. They help, but not completely. You see, I am trans. I am a woman, something like that.

I want, I need to change my body. I will transition. And I know everything will be harder. When I realized what was happening with me I was a complete mess. I was suicidal, I couldn't see a future of me. My whole life plan was ruined. I thought my future was gone.

Now, I'm not so pessimistic. I will look for a specialist, I'll change. In the capital I can do the process to change my name and birth certificate. I won't be alone. Catherine knows and loves me like this. Some of my closest friends know, too. I know people will hate me, and almost anyone won't understand me, maybe won't even try. I don't mind if it's something hard for you to take down. I don't expect to just accept it. I just want to know you'll keep loving me, even though I wasn't and never will be the son you thought you had.


I actually thought I would be able to tell him today. I knew I wouldn't be able to the moment I told Catherine I was thinking of it.

Yesterday's was Catherine surgery while I was in Hollywood. I just sent her a picture of this text. She answered back saying how it hurt her. She feels guilty about how I asked her to tell her parents. Today she waited for me in her house. I visited her. Her mother opened the door for me and ask me to move my car a little back just like she does.

I read the text again after looking at her answer. Her emotions were behind my eyes in this second reading. They overflowed me, they rolled down by my cheeks.

Yesterday I was in the park. I woke up in the early morning by Luis side. We shared a bed. Miguel was sleeping in the other one. I was awake before his alarm started. I turned the first and second one off. He did wake up to shut the third one down. Was I going to dare wearing the jeggings? I had forgotten the black lycra shorts I wear under them. I forgot my long black cardigan, too.

The bathroom was empty and dark. The sink was outside the door, exposed. I decided to shower first. Miguel was still asleep, maybe, but Luis was already awake. I took my clothes and brought them with me to the bathroom. I put the gray panties first and the gray bra. Was I wearing a tank top underneath? Yeah, it was a red one. The jeggings fit fine. There was no obvious bulge. I was anxious, though, I did hesitate and fought with my genitals, trying to hide them, to get rid of them, even for a day.

Just like that I wanted to hide my beard. How could I shave? The sink was outside. I forgot the shaving gel, too.

My dad just came down the stairs, like my dream, he walked away instead of close. Do I want him to come?

Before leaving the day before I was typing this words. I had to cheat but I did half of them. He came and saw me. "Are you alright?" I nod my head and started cheating. We were getting off. Luis told him what I was doing. He asked him instead of me. Words for what? What are they about? How do you know they are 750 and not 749 or less?

He tries to get close, to know me. He asked me about Caherine. Maybe he finds it just as hard as me.

I wore the gray sweatshirt in the bathroom and shaved with the cheap razor and the rest of the little shampoo from the hotel.

I was with Catherine when my mother started uploading the pictures.

"I hadn't seen them, what are they, tights?" she noticed. Would anyone else notice, too? Thousands of people cross sights with me that day. What do they saw? I ask the question as if there could be a possibility of doubt.

She told me today she loved me.

She loves me.

She told me but I can't to my dad.

## 2016-03-26

The washing machine is now functional. We are not in Mexicali. The technician finished in the afternoon so we decided to stay.

It's fine, I guess. I woke up in the early morning by the light that came from the window in the other room. I dreamed something, I guess. I remember a dinner or something like that. Catherine was with me and there was another girl, too. Ana Karen? The young woman who exit her session with Liliana just before we waited for our patient.

I fell asleep again after eating my breakfast. My father spent most of the day alone in the living room. The Godfather was recorded in our DVR. He saw parts of them. My mother stayed in bed until after the washing machine was fixed. Miguel did so, too.

I should shower, there is a faint smell that annoys me. I feel dirty, like if a stench surrounds me. Maybe I can clean it away with water. Does it have to do with this feeling of disgust?

Did I forget to take my pills or did I took the double of my dosage?

Yesterday I went to Catherine's house. I wore a bra underneath my t-shirt. We lied in her bed. Her mother looked at us, found us in Catherine's room. She asked her if I was asleep. I was sad. I felt vulnerable and exhibited. "Her boyfriend, Ivan".

"I'm not your boyfriend" I told her hurt.

She told me she liked me and it hurt me also. How could she like me?

No, I can't do this. There is this smell that distracts me. I'm dirty. I have to clean myself.


I returned. I am tired. "How are you?" Catherine asked me moments after I left. I changed my pijama. I am wearing the same pants I bought when I was in jr high, four years of college, three of high school, more than 8 years ago. My father is watching tv in his room. My mother is watching some show or movie on her ipad besides him.

I walked into their room to grab a towel. I showered and wondered. Will Rene be disappointed with me not talking to him still? He knows it's hard for me. He must know. But yet again, maybe it's something that I ought to do before he can give me his letter, his report.

I read about those people on the internet. Some are filled of doubts, others with pain and desperation. Some have told to their parents and met nonsupport. I am thirsty. My throat is dry. Maybe it's all those words stuck in there.

I could well go to their room and kneel down on their bed. My mother already knows but my father doesn't have to know that. Maybe he knows, as well.

I can look at them and wait for their "what happened?".

"Nothing... it's just about my therapy. I asked Rene for a report, I will show it to you if you want, but I could tell you right now, anyway. You already know I take antidepressants and that I've been depressed. You don't know why. I talked a little with my mother but that was it. I don't like my body nor how I look. I don't like being a man. I don't like having my hair short or hearing people telling me 'I'm really handsome'. It hurts me, it hurts me looking at myself in the mirror or in pictures. It hurts me wearing a suit, recently it even hurts me hearing my own name.

I'm transgender. I'm trans. I'm part of that group of people that has been appearing on the news. The ones who go through this treatment to change their appearance and sometimes even get surgeries and go through this long and tedious procedure to change their names and papers. I'm those kind of people whom this new laws that prohibit them to enter to certain bathrooms affects them.

I've been talking about it, working with it with my therapist. That's why I've kept going to therapy even though I graduated. The medication helps a little but it's not enough.

That's why I want to make an appointment to get rid of my facial hair and I've already set an appointment with a specialist, an endocrinologist to start some treatment.

I know this might seem rush and I'm really sorry about that, but it's not to me. I've been dealing with this for years, all by myself. And I've been meaning to tell you, but I was so ashamed and scared that it took me just now to get the courage.

...And even yet, you won't read this. As you haven't read any of the other rehearsals I've written for myself."



## 2016-03-27

My parents and Miguel went to the movies. Luis is here, home, with me. Right now he's playing with the Xbox. He made himself some chicken and a pot of soup. We shared the soup. The ice cream that my father bought in the weekend is mostly cream. I served myself a cup and he filled a glass for himself.

I, doesn't matter how much I try to shift my point of view to the present, keep going to the past. What is it in me that fixates on the past?

I'm scared of thinking about the future. Paola sent us a message telling us there wouldn't be a party for her graduation but a trip to Las Vegas. It would be two years from now. Catherine was right, we don't even know where we would be by then. I can't see myself holding a job, having a way to prove financial independence. Two years from now I plan on already having changed my own name. Looking completely different as how I look today. What will I do when I plan to renovate my visa? Will they let me? Will I be able to?

It's just a trip, not even that. It's nothing more than a plan and it brought me fear and anxiety. Next year I want to be in the process of getting into the master. I want to be on hormones. In less than two weeks I'll see the endocrinologist. My father doesn't know about me. My mother doesn't know about the appointment. They might get upset that I didn't consult them.

So, there is a reason why avoid talking about the future. What's my excuse for ignoring the present, too?

Even writing daily, I focus on what I did, not what I am doing, thinking nor feeling.

What is it that I am thinking just now? I am waiting for my parents. I'm hearing Hurt of Johnny Cash. I'm listening to Luis playing in the living room. Could I tell Luis? We are alone in the house. He is confiding more and more on me. He talks about his friends, he makes jokes. He asks me serious questions. He might understand me.

I should tell my dad. I should update my mom about what I am doing. They already know about the laser. I told them, I got their approval. My mother even encouraged me to do it, to endure the pain.

What is it that keeps me from calling and making the appointment? I will just call and say I'm interested, ask for prices or a date to do a consultation. Then just wait for the day or time to go there. Whenever I go, they will just look at me, see me, evaluate my face, how many facial hair I have, they might tell me the number of sessions, the prices and the basic care before and after.

I see the pictures and my facial hair is the most obvious sign of my past. A couple of sessions, not more than a year and it will be gone. I want it. I am sure I don't want a beard. I am completely sure that I want it gone. Even more than the hormones. So why am I delaying it? What is it that scares me?

I keep looking to the message that I wrote to Chevo and Jessica. I offered them to ask me any questions and didn't answer my own examples. The last time they saw me, in the beach, nobody called me by any name. Jessica asked Catherine about me, about us. She used Ivan. She has every right, I wasn't even present. I would never read nor hear it. Why did it hurt? I asked them, I told them. It hurt. Now they were asked, so not doing wasn't an accident.

No, they did tell me. If it slips out is not personal. Why did that hurt, too? It's normal. It's years knowing me by a certain way. I can't just expect them to change the way they know me overnight.

I considered answering the questions. Opening up. Reminding them about my offer to chat. A cup of coffee, a cup of tea, anything. I could pay, it's not a problem. I just want to talk, nothing in particular, doesn't even have to be about me. Just want to see some familiar faces, hear some voices, remind myself that I'm not alone.

Why don't I just send it?

Why don't I just go to him?

"I want to talk with you about something".

## 2016-03-28

"It makes me nervous you telling your dad ... It makes me nervous thinking about telling my parents"

Today I could not wake up in the morning. Yesterday I stayed almost the whole day in bed. I woke up and ate breakfast. Returned to bed and slept. It was a cycle of getting up and coming back to bed. Past midnight I longed for that need of sleeping. I'll keep getting bigger and bigger if I don't stop sleeping.

So, this morning I kept postponing the alarms. Catherine went and returned from the doctor and I was still in bed. Did I dream something? Does it matter?

I thought, again, about telling my dad. Today he would return to work. He would not be at home the whole day. His vacations are over. There are just two sessions left with Rene until my appointment in the hospital.

I made myself breakfast with the leftover taco from yesterday. My parents went to the movies with Miguel. They saw Batman v Superman. Luis stayed home with me. My father told my mother how Luis stayed because we was waiting to go see it with me. How he was waiting to the day I would leave him alone. Does he really thinks I would be capable of doing something like that? Is that how he sees me?

He is still upstairs.

No, I just heard his voice in the living room. I won't tell him tonight. Probably I won't tell him tomorrow either. I don't know if I will tell him this week.

There is this thought that keeps coming back and back again. Rene will give me the report. He might give it to me the day after tomorrow. Will I show it to my dad? There is something a lot of people do when they come out to their families. They either send an email. or leave a written note. I, two years ago, when I was in Europe, wrote and e-mail to send home. Why have I discarded that idea since then?

Because it's just waiting. It's giving him the letter and waiting for it to be seen. After that it's waiting for him to say something, made a comment of it. Ask a question. What if he stays silent? What if nothing comes out of it?

What if I stand up in front of him and hand him the letter face to face. A little piece of paper that just says "I want to tell you something." In the backside it can say "I'm transgender". No, I keep thinking of this gimmicky stupid ideas of delaying my own words.

I will go to him whenever we can be alone. I'll tell him I want to talk with him about something so I can't back out. Then I'll just say it. There are few point that I have to touch. I don't have to give him all my story or share all the details.

I know this. I will start with what he already knows.

I'm still going to therapy. I take antidepressants. I am depressed.

From there, I can, slowly,say what he might know or suspect.

I don't like my body. That's why I am depressed. I haven't liked it since I started puberty. I've been living in this kind of fogged state, numb.

No... I start rambling again. Keep it short.

Known facts: I keep going to therapy. I take antidepressants. I am depressed.

The surface: I don't like my body. I don't like how I look. I don't like being a man.

Connect it to the known: That's the reason I keep going and I'm taking medication.

A little deeper: The treatment helps but it's not enough. I feel better but it's still not right. There is something wrong with me. I don't like being seen as a man. I want, no, need to change my body.

The punchline: I am transgender.

 From there the rest is just explaining. I realized before going to spain. I've been scared about them, about my own future. It's been two years since I realized it and started coming up to terms with it. I've talked with my closed friends. I've been talking about it with my therapist. I know what I will do. I will go to an endocrinologist and ask for treatment. I will go to a laser place and get rid of my facial hair. I will travel to the capital and apply to a master. There I can do all the legal paperwork so I can live my own life. Not anyone's else. Live as who I really am.

I'm not ready. I'm not ready to tell him, to defend myself.

I can't stand more time living like this but I'm not strong enough to fight for what I want.

## 2016-03-29

5o again.

Tomorrow I will might get my report.

150 days with today's streak and I haven't told my father. I've written it here several times. I've rehearsed it in my bed, in the shower, in my sleep. Today when I arrived from Catherine's house he came down to my room to ask me to move the car. Since then he has spent the whole night in his room. My mother was here in the living room but then went to give him company. It should not change a thing.I could tell them both. It would be easier. Both of them in bed and I kneeling at the bottom.

"Can I talk with you about something? It's about my therapy. You already know I've been taking antidepressants. It's been, well, more than 150 days, actually. Almost half a year. I have been depressed. I don't know how much have you noticed but you know that already. That's why I keep going to therapy even though I graduated. I talked a little with my mom about it before. I don't like my body, I hate it. I don't like how I look, how people see me. I don't like being a man. I'm not one.

I hate saying those words, explaining it. It's hard. I am transgender. You have seen the news about people like this. They change their bodies, their names. People don't want them using certain bathrooms. It's a mess, but I am like this.

I like when I go out with Catherine and they "get mistaken". They welcome us as two women. The waitress asks me for my order as a "lady". Months ago sometimes someone would come to me and call me by a female noun. Then they would see my face closely and apologize profusely. But they were wrong. I liked their mistake. I liked how they see me the first time. It was their apology that hurt.

So, yes. I don't like being treated as a man, I don't like when people expect things from me because of my genitals.

No. I just don't like my body. I don't like my big hands or my broad shoulders. I hate these tiny damn hairs that grow on my face. I want to shave daily but my skin gets irritated. I wish I could just take them away. I've always hated cutting my hair.

It doesn't matter. I don't have to explain it. It's not something new. This is what I've been talking about in my sessions. This is what depresses me. Half a year ago I needed help and I was prescribed with antidepressants, but they're not enough. Sure they've help but they don't fix the problem.

I want to change what I don't like. I want to stop being who I am not, who people expect me to be. I want to be myself. I want to be me. And I have to change my body to do that. I will. I will change my sex."

No.

No, no, no. I can just say that. That is not right. How can I stand in front of them and open up? How can I explain it?

What if they don't understand me? What if he doesn't agree or approve?

What if he hits me?

Yesterday before falling asleep I imagined asking him to fix the glove box and using that time alone to start talking. I imagined his reaction. It was not what I would actually expect. He reacted violently. He was enraged, he raised his hand and hit me. He ran towards me. He would keep hitting me.

That is not my dad. That would never happen. Why did I think it?

Today I went to Catherine's house. Tomorrow is my session with Rene. Tomorrow I'll stop by the pharmacy and buy my medication. Tomorrow I might get my report. I might use it. I can show it to them.

Catherine told me how her therapist published the same offer again. Now it's not just a receptionist, it's an assistant who would manage her agenda and maybe apply some evaluations. Half time, a thousand pesos every two weeks. This time it didn't specify being just for students.

Why did I feel pressure? Why was I scared? Why wouldn't I call? I don't want to ask it by phone. It's easier to deal with rejection by an e-mail or just silence. On the phone is actually saying it: "I'm Ivan and I need your help."

And then expecting and answer.

I am not Ivan. I don't want to keep saying it. I feel trapped in my own lie.

It would had been better if her parents would had never known me as her boyfriend.

## 2016-03-30

This week I will tell my dad. This week I'll make an appointment to the laser place on monday. I want to start. I need to start.

Rene didn't print me his report but he showed it to me. He apologized for putting Ivan as the name. It hurt, reading it. Reading the name and the sex and then reading the history of my feelings and fantasies. "Has thought about wearing his mother's clothes". "Sometimes dresses in women's clothes and wears make up".

It's a report. It's just something that he has to do. I can understand it.

This morning I decided to wear something feminine. I shaved thoroughly and wore make up. I thought about wearing the leggings but instead put on some jeans. In the morning I tied a scarf around my neck. I cut myself in the bathroom shaving. I should had made the appointment. Will I call or will I send another text message? I prefer calling now. Setting the appointment and asking for precise directions to the place.

I don't know how people saw me. Some said good morning, something that they never do. I drove to the pharmacy. The pharmacist received my prescription and looked for the bottles. "Did the young man gave you a card?" asked the woman who would charge me.

I went to Dax and looked at the make up. I bought a new foundation, the same one that is almost empty. I picked some make up removal tissues and some little sponges. All of it I paid. There was no mention of anything in the cashier. No looks, no words.

I saw three different people scan me with their eyes. It was as if their sights were an x-ray machine, looking through me.

With Rene I explained how I can't tell my dad yet. It feels as if I'm cheating. I don't consider giving him a letter, or telling my mom to explain what I told her to him. I have to do it myself as if it were some judge who were looking. As if I don't deserve it, somebody will prohibit me the change.

He turned my words around. What if... what if I can't tell my dad because of this feeling of betrayal, of treason. Is it, that I feel as I've cheated him of his son. Betrayed the relationship he thought he had with him, made him believe something I never was. Is that what scares me of telling him the truth?

It has to be with the fear that I have of telling Catherine's parents. I regret getting them to know me as Ivan, as their daughter's boyfriend. They've known this person, this young man, and I'm not him. They invited him to dinner, to their house, to their table. He played with their nephew and stayed with their daughter. And yet he doesn't exist. He's a lie.

What will happen when they know, when they realize. Will they be angry? Will they be upset? Will his dad resent me?

There is a possibility that they uninvite me from their wedding.

And I wander away from the thought of telling my father. Rene asked me to send him a message when I tell him. It will be something big. His reaction is still something unknown. It might be big, chaotic. Was he trying to be helpful? He's there, he will be there no matter what happens. Maybe he could act as a transferential projection of my father.

Maybe it was his way of pressuring me to do it. Create an expectancy. I might have already the deadline of doing it before next thursday but know there is somebody who knows and expects it. I talked about closing the door behind my back when I enter to my parents room to talk to him. Maybe he's putting himself by my back, both as a support and a pressure.

I stayed with Catherine. Ate again in her house. Her mother made soup. Her nephew was with us. I played with him. He looked for me with his big and innocent eyes. He smiled. What does he look? Everyone sees me as a man, everyone of her relatives know me as "that-Ivan". Will he get to know me like that?

I picked Anahi up from the Burger King and drove her to Catherine's. We stopped in the Oxxo to buy something to drink. The police guard welcomed us strongly. I stayed quiet. Anahi paid and there was no comment, no lady or welcome. Nothing. Like there were no need to say she was a woman. We went to the door and the police looked at me "You have really long hair, man". I just smiled and swallowed my pain down my throat. "Pull it down to see where it reaches", I smiled again but maybe Anahi noticed my discomfort in my eyes. I ignored him and exit.

We saw Paper towns in Catherine's bed. Anahi told us about her date. Tonight won't be the time I tell my dad. Maybe tomorrow. I have a week.

## 2016-03-31

Days keep passing by. I told Anahi about my plans with the laser. Everyone wants to get rid of hairs. They don't have to deal with a beard. Nobody sees them like men.

That's not the point. Three times today I asked my mother what were the plans for tomorrow and the weekend. What answer am I looking for? What is it that I want to know? After my father got home, he went straight to his room. My mother was already there. Even now is early enough for me to go and talk to him, to them.

I've made my speech, I won't repeat it again. It almost feel like cheating at this point. In my words, I mean.

Cheating, that was the interpretation Rene gave me about my reluctance to face him. It's not just tell him. It's facing him, standing in front of him and show myself, open up and let him know me, show him his mistake, correct his wrong idea about me.

It has to do, also, with shattering the future he might had thunk I have.

I have Luis here by my side just know. He's lying in my bed watching some video on youtube. Do I fear the same about shattering the image of his big brother? I don't care about how Miguel thinks about me, why don't I tell him first? Doesn't he look up to me, too?

I did laundry today. First it was my underwear. I remember when I was nervous about cleaning a pair of panties and a bra with the rest of my underwear. I would wait until nobody could see me. I would close the door on hide the garments inside the ball of the rest of my clothes. Over and over would I go and check the timer left. It was impossible for me to forget about it and let the clothes there.

Now, what is it? A year later? two? Now it was some tank tops, three pijama pants and the rest was woman's underwear. Three bras and maybe ten or twelve pair of underpants of different colours. Have I really changed without realizing? I was taking them from the washing machine to the dryer when Luis entered the laundry room.

"What are you doing?" I threw the black pants into the lighted hole. He peeked inside towards the colourful pile of wet clothes.

I tried to cover them and thought: "why?" And why indeed? I keep again and again to cover it, hide it. What would happen had he seen something?

"Is that a brassiere? Why do you have a brassiere in your laundry?" "Those are woman's panties"

Yes. Yes, it is, they are. They are mine. That's the answer that I could have given. That was the only thing needed to be said. Everything coming after that would had been just an explanation.

Maybe that's the only thing I need. Letting me be seen. Letting them see me and explain it.

No. I'm doing it again.

I will do it. Yesterday was the first day. Today, the second. I have a week. I will tell my dad. I need not to pressure myself. I have time. A week is lots of time. More than enough.

I showed Luis a condom. I picked it from the drawer and let him handle it. I, after that, let him know I have a bottle of lubricant. Why wasn't I afraid of that? I play with him about the idea of suppositories and prostate exams. I would feel no shame in telling him, or even my parents that my sex is unconventional. They don't need to know, though. What's the difference then?

What's the difference of them knowing that I like the feeling of being penetrated and dominated to letting them know about how I'm not really a man. I am a woman. Inside.

The words of Rene's report keep coming back. Reality's idea. Self-perception. The subject commits himself to the idea of pertaining to the female gender.

It reads so clinical and impersonal. I answered Jessica's question yesterday, too. She hadn't written anything after confirming Chevo's comment. She asked me, taking names out, who would be the person she would be in front of next time we would see each other.

I let Catherine know of the messages, the things said. Something in Jessica's made her feel something, too. "It's like what you're going through goes over her head. Like she's unable to comprehend. I feel her agressive.

She answered back and told me that they would visit Catherine next Wednesday. If I wanted to see them alone we could see each other, today they would leave work after 6pm.

Wednesday would be fine. I will meet Rene and get his report. Anahi asked me if I wanted to cross the border and going with her to target Tuesday.

Maybe Saturday we will go to the united states and maybe we will spend the weekend in Mexicali, too.

Every day gets filled. I don't think I'll make the appointment to the laser's this next week.

Now it really is just one week. I'm nervous. I really am.

But I'm even more excited.

## 2016-04-01

I actually believed for a minute that I would have told my father today. I guess this will be another missed day.

I woke up later, as usual. It was hard opening my eyes, stop turning looking for another minutes of rest. I took my pills and stepped out of my room to see what was happening in their lives. My mother was having breakfast so I ate what was left in the stove. She has this habit of making a little more food than usual. She's used to cook food for more people besides her. She has never lived alone.

For a year she lived outside her hometown. There she lived with a friend and a family. When she came back and married my father, actually younger than I am now, she lived with him, her lover.

I haven't lived alone either. I lived with roommates in another country. It was a little like living alone but not really.

It doesn't matter. I ate breakfast and lied down on the couch. Catherine sent me a text message telling me that she had just gotten news of Liliana. She had two patients ready for an evaluation. Why did Liliana keep contacting Catherine? Why not me? I remembered how she's still in bed. It would be me the one who would attend them. I don't like treating children, but it's work.

I'm excited and full of energy a total opposite of how it was before. I showered in wait of the call. I decided for her to give them my phone instead of the other way around. All is set. I will see them tomorrow at 1 in the afternoon. It will be an interview with the parents. I maybe should had looked for an structured format to be prepared. One hour. I can charge them 400 pesos or 200 dollars for the whole procedure.

I dreamed with Monica today. It was again the same school of my childhood, the one Luis actually is attending now. Six years I spent in there. It's more than 10 years ago and yet I keep dreaming with that building. Three floors. I was looking for a room, for something. I don't remember that part.

I just remember the scene of me looking for her, waiting for her. She was wearing a skirt, was it blue like in high school? She wasn't a kid. Both of us weren't. I turned and her skirt was clipped on her waist. Except when I turned it wasn't. Her crotch was exposed. She wasn't wearing any underwear. Her skin was as pale as I remembered, there was no hair surrounding her vulva. She quickly covered herself. There was no comment. I can't remember the rest.

All day was getting prepared mentally about the meeting, and the battery of tests and the evaluation.

That and telling them.

Miguel decided not going to the gym. I was going to take him. It was a relief. I showered anyway. My hair is dry now, undone, just tied.

Tomorrow they will cross the border without me. I have work, I have a patient. It feels... great.

Not telling them, on the other hand, it's a huge weight. This secret, I've been getting used to it's toll. But the pressure of telling them before the time comes, it's a whole other issue.

Rene was right. I'm scared and feeling guilty of cheating my own father of his son. I feel like I have betrayed him and keep doing so every day he doesn't know. I have to tell him and tell him right. I have to face him and confess.

On the other hand I am scared. I have seen myself in those pictures. I have seen myself with make up and a dress. I have seen my face. I have seen me and felt hideous. He sees me now every day and sees his son. When I tell him he might see me as I see myself in those pictures. He might see me as hideous and monstrous as I look in the reflection. And there is no coming back. After he knows I can't take the words out of his ears, I won't be able to take the image of me out of his eyes.

And so I continue being scared. I was in his room and knelt down on his bed and started chatting. It's way easier for me to tell him about something I am proud of. "Look, I got a job" I have something to do. I am not useless.

Miguel came in and I dropped the will of blurting it.

Right now I have the words inside of me. I promised Catherine I would write a letter. I might just give it to him. I should
start writing it.

## 2016-04-02

I'm right here in the same couch of my uncle's house. We are all gathered in this sort of living room or meeting room with the tv on. There is always a movie playing and being ignored. Everyone is talking with somebody. I'm here with my words. There is a smell of popcorn in the air.

I was going to have a meeting with my patients. The alarm was set on 10 and a half in the morning. I postponed it by 10 minutes. A couple of moments before its time, my phone started singing. I answered and there was a male voice introducing itself. For a moment I thought he was with Telcel. I waited a while until he said he had a meeting with me. He had a job inconvenience so he would had to postpone. It was fine. It was better for me. I could go to the united states with my parents. I will see them next Tuesday. Two days before my appointment.

I haven't talked with my dad. Today I was in my grandmother's house. I was lying on her bed, Luis by my side. My father was nowhere on sight. I asked for him and my mother told me he was outside. Miguel said he was in the car. I stepped outside. It was dark. There was nobody on the street. The car was dark, too. Not a single light on. I could see the drawing of the shadow of my dad. He was asleep, resting.

I thought about it a lot. I wanted to, didn't I? I could had gone outside, opened the door and sat in the copilot seat. Maybe he would be scared. "What happened?" he might ask. Did you need something?

"They see worse things today" My cousin went to see the Deadpool movie. "And that homosexual thing they showed us, Ranma 1/2, the which converted to a woman in the night."

Yeah, of course they would say something like that. Why does it keep surprising me even now?

My mother again reacted. No, it's not like Rene said. She wasn't testing nothing, she was being carried by the social pressure. She jokes about stuff to be funny. She gets defensive and uses stupid jokes to ease the tension. Looking for approval? It doesn't matter. It doesn't change shit.

"No", I would tell my dad. Of course I would back out. I would get scared, my heart pumping furiously, hitting my chest. Maybe a couple of minutes would pass in the darkness, me hating myself and my dad trying to get back to sleep.

One of two things would happen. Either I would had stayed silent indefinitely until leaving the car or I would start talking.

"I did want to tell you something..." By then my heart would be unstoppable. I would actually fear it leaving my body.

"...it's about therapy".

It wasn't the right time. My mother could had gone out at any moment. I don't know how he would react. Time is still running. The day is closer than ever. It's less than a week.

Yesterday I could not sleep. Tossing and turning were both the thought in my head and my body in the sheets. How could I say it. How could I force me to talk about it. Three times I stepped inside their room, at the feet of the bed. I wanted to say it, talk about it, scream it. I wanted to be seen and heard but I'm scared of what they will see.

My father didn't laugh at the joke about the cartoon. My aunt did see it. She explained it a little to my mom.

One, two, three in the morning. The night was running, as well. Even at noon I was afraid of not getting to the meeting. I took my phone out and started writing. I told Catherine I would write a letter. I still have it here in my computer. aiWriter is open; there is a window with a short text I could use as back up. I discarded that idea.

"Will you print it?" she asked. Something about that idea she didn't like. I can see it. It's impersonal, artificial. I thought about writing it, but what if it's illegible? What if he doesn't understand?

So there at night the idea came up again. There was a box in the shelf over the bed. There lies my plaque and the one of my parents. I didn't give it to them. There was an opportunity. I could write a note with it thanking them for their support, asking for it more. Telling them I need them.

I fell asleep thinking about that idea. Today I will sleep in this house, hundreds of kilometers away from both the plaque, the unwritten note and the room in which I've imagined telling them all these nights.

## 2016-04-03

I took the plaque out. It's here besides me in the desk. We've arrived from the United States. My stomach is upside-down. I feel my heart beating in my throat. I want to tell them now. Everyone is in their bedroom. I just help putting the cover to the iron board. I feel like the air I'm breathing is not enough. I have this words inside of me and their burning, poisoning me.

I have to tell them today. I will...


I deleted the words. I was going to cheat but I have an hour still.

I did. I finally opened up. I could hear the disappointment in his voice. Something that he said broke me. I could not see his eyes.

"You will make your life very difficult. Have you think this through?" That was the first thing that worried me about telling him. I know his pessimism and doubt. I know his worries. I knew this would happen and waited for it. Even then I was not prepared to fight for my decision.

"It's not something that I thought yesterday. I've been thinking this through for 2 years and a half."

I defended it with an iron wall. I was going to be unmovable. At first I even considered saying it: "I just wanted to tell you, I wanted you to know. I felt this inside of me, burning me and I wanted to take it out."

I was going to continue, but fortunately stopped and let them talk. "Now that you know, I don't care if you support me or not. Now that you know, that's all that I wanted." Those words got lost in the silence.

"Don't do something foolish... I don't know what would happen if I knew you ever do something stupid... Don't give up... the world is hard..." At first I thought he was referring to my decision as foolish. At first, maybe he was. Changing your body. Everything will be harder. Doing something permanent.

Those were his words in the first half. By the second one he was telling me over and over to not give up and that he would never care what other people say. I was his son and would always be his son. Those words hurt me and yet comforted me. I wasn't going to ask him to change his way of talking.

I talked about the appointment. This thursday I will go and won't have to be alone.

I feel like crying. I talked about looking for a job, being denied.

I had never seen my father cry before. Just remembering his eyes watering makes me want to crawl in bed and bawl my own eyes out.

But it's done. It's over. He knows. She knows. My mother talked about my brothers but I won't rush it. She mentioned the kids part. I talked about my own life versus the one drawn by other people's expectations.

I told him about my depression, how I felt. How it was. I explained antidepressants, their methods.

He's proud of me. I'm excellent at what I do and have a brilliant future ahead of me. And then repeated his words. "Don't give up".

He corrected me furiously. "You're not alone, don't ever say you were alone."

Silly dad, of course I was. Inside of my mind I lived, hidden from the world. I might had not been trapped like the stereotype says, but I was hidden and alone. Nobody knew about me, not even myself. Years I was alone, unseen.

I didn't come back from Spain. Their son went there and died. He was dying before leaving here. His dead was announced on my 21st birthday. When I was in Spain he perished and I surfaced. Just Catherine knew about me and saw me.

I was scared of coming back, taking his life, meeting my family, letting me be seen. So I hid in his skin. I played his part again. I ignored the only witness who knew about my existence. I abandoned her. Miraculously she never gave up on me. She always stood there waiting for when I returned. And I did, and I love her and she loves me. And he's right. I'm not alone, she will always be by my side.

And now I will have them, too.

She hesitated on some pronouns by half of her talk. I still won't ask her yet. Luis and Miguel will be a piece of cake from now.
Everything from here seems so easy. The changes are now welcome.

## 2016-04-04

"Yesterday I told my dad. I'm fine. I'll see you this Wednesday. Will I pay you something extra for the report?"

I sent him the message this morning. He asked me to tel him when I talked with my dad. Was he worried for me or was he expecting it for the report?

There are a a couple of blank sheets of paper besides me, on top of the Human Development text book.

I asked Hilda if she took the class about child psychopathology. She enlisted for me the tests they reviewed in that class. I have their names and authors. As they used them for the battery of their own patients, there ought to be a way to get them. I don't have to look for them just now. Tomorrow I'll meet with the parents and offer the evaluation.

I don't have to offer them anything. They are the ones who are consulting me. They looked for me. They looked for somebody and Lili sent them my way. They are asking for my services. They are the ones reaching out, not me.

I can name my own price and they have to decide if take it or not. I won't be offering, just naming it. How much is my work worth? I know my last work was higher than 250 pesos. Five labor days of the minimum wage here in Mexico. I researched and graded.

None of my colleagues would do what I did. I used a test even some of my teachers don't know.

Nothing will I gain for throwing myself flowers. They might deny me or just don't come back. Patients always leave. Last night I rehearsed how I would talk to them, explain how would things go. I talked towards my white wall as if he could give me feedback. "Yeah, that's great. Sure you will get them. You are awesome".

I had a headache. This pulsing pressure just inside of my forehead. I had told Anahi what had happened. I had a conversation over the phone with Catherine. My voice was calmed and tired. I wanted to cry as I changed the sheets before lying in bed.

I visited her today. I took Miguel to the gym. My mother was supposed to be at the salon but as I came down from the shower I met her sitting in the kitchen table. I drove him anyway. I shaved and wore a bra under my shirt. I didn't feel the need to put on make up.

I don't think I'll wear any Wednesday either. I know I will cry with Rene. What will I wear Thursday? How should I meet the dr? I think about going as androgynous as I can. Jeans and a t-shirt and the black long sweater.

I'll think about that later. Today is 4th. Just three more days. Yesterday I told my dad. Tomorrow I will have my second consultants. The day after that I will receive my report and then, the appointment.

I am nervous. I am scared. I won't deny it. I am anxious, too. Excited as I have ever been.

"I don't know if we're not talking again. Months ago when I told my mom I wrote to you. Yesterday I talked with my dad. You might not care, I felt like telling you anyway."

I talked with her ghost as I was driving in the freelane from dropping Miguel to Catherine's house. I said that line and turned as if I could see her. More than a hundred and fifty days with a break inbetween. I deleted her from my contacts. Both my mother and brothers still have her. She might had seen the pictures from them. Has she noted my absence? Does she care?

"Do I change the name I have in whatsapp?"

I had thunk about changing the picture, the name. Putting on Sofia, setting an even more feminine snap of my face.

What would I gain? My contacts know already. In my cellphone the names of my contacts appear as I have them in my address book. Nobody might even notice. Do I feel nervous still? What is it that scares me?

I put on Sofia in snapchat. My aunts possible saw it.

Does my mother have me in Whatsapp? Does she even use it? Does Jessica? Hilda?

I won't create a new Facebook until I take the first pill. I have decided that. I don't know how will it work.

If I change the name, would Monica notice? Would I sent her a message still?

## 2016-04-05

"Confirming today's appointment at 1"

When I read her message I sensed I had made a huge mistake not confirming to them.

I woke up several times in the morning. The first times where around 8. I looked at the phone and saw a couple of notifications. Monica had answered my message. I did send it. I had changed the name and the picture. "I feel weird, I don't know, like exposed, vulnerable". The feeling wasn't enough so I reached out for her. In the morning I saw her "what did he tell you?".

Catherine and Anahi said other things about tomorrow's visit. I will see her after my session. I don't feel like parking far away and walking the couple of blocks to Rene's. I don't know if I should shave tomorrow or until Thursday. Tomorrow I know I won't wear any make up. I plan to cry tomorrow, to tell Rene and tell him my worries and cry, because I feel like doing that. I am nervous and a little scared. I told my parents, they know, they are assimilating it. Miguel might suspect it and I doubt Luis has no idea. There is no reason any more for the report to not be tomorrow. Without its absence and the lack of my parents knowledge, I don't know what may make the endocrinologist to reject me for treatment.

I have my father's words stuck in my ear still. What will Rene say? Will he say something about me reaching out to Monica? I don't feel guilty about it. I did nothing wrong. Why don't I tell Catherine?

What will I wear, both tomorrow and the day after? What image do I want to give to the dr? How do I want him to see me? I shared with Catherine my worry and uneasiness about asking for Ivan's appointment for Hormone Replacement Therapy. On top of that, will I meet them with skinny pants and a made up face? Do I want to be a walking contradiction? What voice will I use? I listened to today's audios from when I was driving home. The voice is different to the one I hear inside of my own head. It's different to the one I imagined when I didn't dare to listen.

What was I going to wear today wasn't such an enigma. I took the square printed pants from the closet yesterday. The shirt was still undecided but unimportant. I showered. Did I shave? What would be the point to that? I don't think so. Exiting the wet room I put on the underwear and pants. There was no bra. It felt like a skipped step in a habitual routine. I didn't shave the face either. I had more time than I thought I would need.

I kept chatting with Monica and exchanging funny pictures with Eusebio. I waited for the time of the meeting with my consultants. I rehearsed what I would say the last couple of days. It wasn't really a surprise when they didn't show up. I had thunk about it. I told Catherine how I felt different this time. I remember when I was waiting for my first paying patient. She was late and I started getting anxious. I feared her abandonment. As my heart ran faster and faster and my mind filled with sadness and self-pity I heard her greeting.

I knew this time wouldn't be the same. If they didn't show up, yeah, of course it would be a disappointment but the world would not end.

Just now I turned towards the door and remember another of my father's words. "Don't bury yourself in your room. Don't isolate yourself. I remember asking you what was wrong. If something had happened". Was it guilt? Did he feel guilty about my melancholy? He is not a bad father. He has never been nothing less of ideal.

I arrived to Liliana's.

No, I was talking about earlier than that. I tied my hair tight in a bun behind my head. I sent a picture marked as "today I will be a boy". It was fine. It didn't hurt. I got to the gas station and was greeting by a sir, and mr, and young man. They didn't hurt either. I didn't enjoy them, but I certainly did not mind.

I was with Liliana, chatting, waiting. She would be my secretary for the day.

They just didn't show up. She will cal them. She might refer me another patient later. A young teenager.

I... I feel fine. And yet my leg is restless.

And my thoughts bouncing from here to there. I keep thinking of tomorrow's session and Catherine's house. Then it's finally three months after my birthday. The day I waited for so much. The day is closer than ever.

## 2016-04-06

I received a message from Johanna. I remember my picture and the changed name. I know that maybe not in every phone it will appear the change. Did it in hers? Has she noticed? I scanned through her words for a mention of it and yet nothing appeared. I read it superficially and ignored it.

I had the phone over my bag beside me in Rene's couch. I was talking to him when it kept ringing and ringing. I had it outside because of what happened earlier while I was showering.

Yesterday Catherine and I talked about Monica. The comparison and parallels between the time we started dating and continued talking with Monica and Anahi's relationship with Ricardo and his ex-girlfriend Carmen.

"Will you tell me when you talk to her? I'm not asking you to tell me what you talked about. Just, you know, not hide it".

I kept silent. I hate

her?

I put the song I used to repeat while we were exchanging videos on youtube. I hate you. Catherine looked at me. I had told her about Monica before Anahi arrived.

I woke up today and skipped the alarms one by one. I didn't have to get up until 11. Tomorrow will be another story. Tomorrow...

The day is here, now. I am nervous as hell. My head keeps looking for reasons why everything might turn to shit.

I took my clothes to the bathroom, brushed my teeth. Did I touch myself today? I stayed in the shower room, my hair dripping wet. I did. I finished and exhaled.

I shaved, too. I decided to skip the bra. I did wear Catherine's pants with a t-shirt and a hoodie. When I came down from the bathroom, there was a notification on my phone. Two missed calls. The application that shows me the name of the registered number showed "Francisco Magallanes". It was just one number different to the one I called three months ago. It was his office. Were they confirming the meeting? Maybe something changed? I returned the call twice. The weird sound of old routers answered me. I hung up.

I waited outside Rene's office. I was early. I parked my car.

...
I'm fixating on the past. Is it that I am reluctant to think about the future? I am on an edge and yet I'm talking about today. I could summarize it in a couple of sentences. I received a message from Johanna. Rene gave me my report. I went to Catherine's and Anahi was with us later in the evening. That's it...

Tomorrow I have an appointment with the endocrinologist. I will have to wake up in the morning and get ready and go to a clinic I've never gone before. I will tell a complete stranger my secret. I will hand to him a report with the information that took me months to be able to tell my own father. In his hands lies my future. He can deny me and I'd be lost. He can say no to me, tell me to wait.

I don't know how doctors treat people like me. He might be kind and nice, he might be an asshole and a bigot.

I don't know. I don't know what will happen in his office, what will I say, what will he?

Whenever I arrive, will the secretaries guide me to his office? Will I have to wait a lot? Will I wait to see him? Will I wait for treatment? Will it be weeks? months?

Just thinking about it makes me feel nervous. I am anxious. The report states that I am fine dealing with frustration, I know the treatment will be multidisciplinary, I know it will be long and slow.

I know, I do know. Why do I keep ignoring it? I want to start. I want to stop disfiguring myself. Two years have passed already. I went and returned from Europe. I went and returned from this. I've told my parents, I've changed my name in the phone.

I fear not being able to get up in the morning and yet I think I won't be even able to sleep.

Thoughts keep spinning and spinning inside of my head. I feared not telling my dad and that is done. I was scared of Rene not giving me my report. I have it in my bag, ready and signed. The appointment has come. The only thing left is waiting. Going and facing him.
Wait and see.

## 2016-04-07

I was drowning in nervousness. Three alarms were set in my cellphone. The first one woke me at 6 in the morning. I stayed awake until minutes before the second one. The first rays of sunlight ignited my anxiety. Today was going to be the day which I had waited for all year. What would happen today?

My mother and Luis left home. I took the clothes that I had set aside and walked upstairs to the bathroom. I showered and shaved. Closely I tried to get every single hair. I didn't want them to see me as a man. I wanted to be surprised, be unrecognizable even though they would not know me. I wanted to look like a woman to fool them when they asked for my name.

And I did put them on. I shaved with my bare torso. I stepped out and returned to my room topless. In my room I hooked my bra in my back. I looked into the mirror and accepted the image. I even did my hair that way. It's the longest I've stayed like that.

I did put make up. It was subtle just a hint to hide the darkness of my face. A little to open my eyes. My voice was kept the same.

I drove. I knew the way, I had checked it the day before.

"Ivan... with the change of name, will there be a way to change your diploma? It's done. There ought to be a way, doesn't it?"

I took the wrong turn. No, I actually missed it. It was raining. I changed my shirt home. I ended up going as I would had gone to the Universal Studios hadn't I forgotten my sweater.

After circling around I got there. The problem was now finding where to park. Another round and I did. Walking in the rain, my hands were shaking with fear. What was I scared of?

"I have an appointment with the Dr Magallanes..."

She confirmed by that name and gave me a piece of paper to fill with my information.

A group of people entered to the waiting room and the receptionist gave them a similar one. "It's a problem with their identity" said one of them. "It's because they don't know who they are..." he kept going about someone they know who never had a girlfriend. Were they talking about that because of me? Hearing steps from the other side of the door made my heart race.

When it finally was for me, I was relieved that the receptionist didn't call out my name. Whatever they thought about seeing me there, it wasn't confirmed by the "you can come in, sir" or "Ivan Fernandez? The dr will see you now".

"So, what can I do for you?" and so it began everything. There were questions and confirmations. "The matter of the name", I said it. He changed it in the file. Everything went smoothly and cordially. It was actually nice meeting him.

"How did your parents take it?" They actually took it very well. I confirmed it when he asked the next question. "There is no violence, right?".

Fuck. Sometimes I forget that some people do fear being hit and thrown out of their homes.

There was something before that, before leaving. I put the Daily show because of the glimpse I caught when I asked my father to move the cars. "Transgender people" said the captions. The whole theme of the show was about people like me. "How does it feel being the focus of such hate?, let's find out". That was what my father saw yesterday.

He checked me, physically. He didn't ask me to undress, although he did see my bra. "Do you have breasts?, or is it the bra? ...oh you fill it... well, they come like that".

"Have you taken hormones before?" "Perfect, it's really good that you brought these, because I was actually going to send you for one. Now we can start with the medical procedure..."

After the examination, back in the chairs and the desk, he took a piece of paper and filled with the information of the test I will take.

Tomorrow I will get my blood drained. An analysis of hormones and other shit. How am I. "Let's see how you are so I can pick the best treatment for you".

I am scared and nervous. I am surprised that I haven't cried.

I told Johanna. I replied to her messages. I told her about me, how I'm feeling, how I felt. She... she didn't answer.

My parents know about my tests. They were to the bank. My father wanted to call and ask for the price. He asked me for the order. I gave it to him. Sofia Fernandez said in the top. Did he see?

Maybe, probably.

Will it hurt me?


My next appointment is the 15th. It will be in the morning. The hour is pending. That day he might give me the prescription.

That actually might be the date. I don't know which of those days, tomorrow or the 15th, scares me the most.

## 2016-04-08

I have high cholesterol and and a high level of blood glucose. My linfocites are a bit high, too, but almost insignificant.

My testosterone levels are in the normal range but high up there. I told Catherine, if they were low, it could mean a reason for my behavior. It they were high, that would mean the changes coming from lowering them would be drastic.

Why do I feel like shit, then?

She's right. I have done a lot for me, I should forget about the world. I went to the endocrinologist, I did the analysis. Now it's just waiting a week so he will give me something. Will he tell me to lower my cholesterol first or the glucose? I am in a risk state of diabetes. I don't drink soda, I don't eat candies.

That is not what has been worrying me.

I began writing avoiding the idea of starting narrating the day, and yet I haven't even mentioned what's on my mind.

Yesterday the dr wrote the order for the studies by my name. I felt glad. It was different, for the first time I had something physical with that name. I am that, this person, I thought. There was a hint of fear, though. At first I just attributed it to my distaste for needles. I slept so little it barely almost counts. Time passed so slowly between 3am and 6. I checked the phone maybe 20 times hoping the alarm were far away.

I imagined this room almost empty, a receptionist and an exam room. Nothing more... just one person who would know about me.

From my seat in the parked car I could see the place. There was a man standing in the door. Three receptionists in the counters and several people in white coats walking from a place to another. Various patients were there already, waiting.

The order said Sofia. I didn't put it. I wouldn't dare to write it and present it. I had a bra under my shirt but it wasn't enough. I shaved yesterday so I skipped this morning. I wouldn't put make up on my face for a half hour.

The man from the door asked me several questions. Day of birth, age, when the time came to the sex, he skipped it. I was interested in seeing what he would put. He hid the table from me. They would call my name so I sat. They sure did. After calling everyone before me by their full name, my turn came.

"Patient Fernandez Lozano?"

I raised my hand shyly. I heard the doubt in her voice.

Just remembering this I feel the tears clouding my vision. Before reading the results I was excited and thrilled. What changed since then? Is it really the cholesterol and glucose? Am I ashamed because I should be healthier?

I had seen the answer by then. I looked towards the paper and saw the M.

"Excuse me, what's your name? ..."

Did I really have to answer it? I was scared, I wanted to run. It was just a fraction of a second. "Is it Sofra?".

I smiled, as trying to tell her "no, I know it's stupid, I'm sorry, it wasn't my intention, the dr wrote it down. I know I don't deserve it yet". Instead, my lips told her "Sofia".

"Sofia, yeah, right." She gave me a bottle to be filled with urine and asked me if it was my first time going to that lab. She gave me a card of discounts. My name is written in its back. I was excited about that, too.

Exiting from the bathroom I gave the full bottle to a woman who extended her hand to reach it. "They will call you in a minute" she told me in the masculine formal 2nd person. She didn't see the name. How funny that then it was what hurt me the most, and now after everything, it's the encounter that I least think about.

I waited in my chair trembling of fear. Another woman grab the last piece of paper remaining and called my name. I stood up and followed her. She took my blood. It didn't hurt as much as I remembered it would.

Everything was over really fast. I drove home. The results would be online after 5pm. They were since 2 in the afternoon but I checked them just an hour ago.

And there it was, my name, by birthdate and my gender.

The card with my name will always be attached to that information. I will always be masculine. It doesn't matter what I put in my body or the changes I will experience. To them I was, and always be, the man with a female's name. I am the man named Sofia and that is what's been hurting me the most.

## 2016-04-09

I wrote my words early yesterday. It was in the early afternoon, 5 o'clock, I think. I wanted them to be done so I could stop worrying about it and just go to sleep. And so I did. I talked about what were on my mind, the initial shock about seeing the sex marked as masculine just besides my name. It was confusion. I would had put it anyway. Even if asked I would not had lied to them. Even if put female I would had corrected them. So what was it really the thing that made me upset?

I kept going back to being there, recalling their words, their faces and reactions. The questions of the guy, the way they called my name, how I was seen again and again. The M made sense. The question about my name. They saw me as me, the real me. Not the me I sometimes ramble about. The transgender person me.

Every person who saw, not just me but my file too, noticed. The first thing seen was the in-congruence. I was Sofia but a man. A man with a woman's name. The receptionist confirmed it. They gave me the card anyway. They didn't ask for my "real" name. They were nice. What would I had preferred?

And so I kept thinking over and over: my file will always be the same. I will always be on their archive as Sofia Fernandez Lozano, born on january seventh of 1993, and male. My age will keep changing, but it won't matter the hormones or physical changes I get, my file will always have "Male" as it will always have my birth date.

I will always be a man with a woman's name. To them, at least.

With that thought I went to sleep as soon as the clock marked 7. An hour or two later I woke up and eat three tacos. Then would I get back to bed. And I slept and dreamed.

I woke in the early morning and typed my dream to Catherine. Anahi was driving a car and I was with her, just the two of us. We were supposed to be in the United States but when I looked out of the window I recognized Tijuana. She lied to me and said we were going to be to Ikea so she could buy a gift for Catherine and me. she admitted to me that we were in Tijuana and we would cross soon somewhere near, she took this path because it would be faster. I asked her if we could go to Target. She accepted telling me how she had said before she really like the clothes there, maybe she could buy something. I told her I wanted to buy something as well. Anything, I didn't really mind what. I had this need of having something feminine, validating, as if a garment of clothes could change the way I were feeling.

I started feeling this tingling between my legs and went down. The familiar sensation of nearing climax. I had no stimulation, the thoughts were sad, the feelings were the opposite of erotic. I was surprised, confused and ashamed. I tried to cover my pants with my arm so she would not see. I put the left one over my left leg as it started to get wet. I turned and, before seeing her reaction, woke up.

In a rush I checked myself with my fingers. Nothing, if I were fast enough I could go to the bathroom and avoid something embarrassing.

It was then that I recalled the scene. Again I was on the left seat and yet was the copilot. Anahi was driving the car as if it was a British one.

Today we went to the United States. We ate in Denny's. I told both of my parents the results of my test. I've decided to take more care of what I eat. I could go to run or do something physical. I want to lose weight, be smaller. I want to be healthy.

I ate salmon and vegetables, a bowl of soup and one taco. I've drunk unsweetened iced tea, a tall cup of iced coffee and glasses of water.

Will those changes last? Even with time will they have an effect?

I am terrified of staying the same. It doesn't matter how much I lose weight I keep getting it back. It doesn't matter how different I look I returned. Maybe that has to do with what has been scaring me.

I have my new glasses on. They're smaller and clearer. I actually like them unlike the pair I chose here.

## 2016-04-10

The day before I had slept more than I should. Yesterday I woke up early to go to the United States. Was it really yesterday? Yes, today is Sunday, the last day of the week. I went to bed but could not fall asleep. I was chatting with Catherine on the phone. Around midnight I stopped answering her texts and turn around. I needed to sleep, otherwise I would wake up late and fall into another insomnia cycle.

After one in the morning the dog from the house next street started barking. An exchange of sounds between the dogs in the neighborhood. I could barely hear the answers it received, but its responses were as loud as if it were lying besides my own bed. Half an hour, maybe a little more I could not take it anymore and stood to close the window. Even then it was difficult for me to catch slumber.

I woke up before my father arrived from his morning coffee. I heard the sound of his pick-up, the rattling of the keys in the keyhole, and the murmurs of the paperbags over the table.

I ate my breakfast trying to take more time than I am accustomed to. I measured my bites before taking them. Leave the food on the table until you're finished with your mouthful. I drank a glass of water with it.

Nobody but me and my dad were in the living room. Miguel was still asleep, Luis, too, maybe. My mother was upstairs. Before coming back to my room my mom came down. I lied down under my sheets and went back to sleep. It was a rest so delicious I would pay normally to have it every night.

From eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon I slept and dreamed.

I showered and visited Catherine in her home. I decided not to shave. I used the machine but it's useless. I had thunk about wearing a bra but it was pointless, too. I asked my dad to move the cars and drove. I have returned from there. We watched netflix on her room. I touched her and she made me cum. We kissed over and over.

I feel weird and I told her just now.

I was hungry, we shared a bag of chips. I ate a slice of pizza and half of a portion of spaghetti. Over there I drank nothing but water. I should be proud, I was taking care of my eating. I could be losing weight. Coming here, though, I did save the ciabatta my parents bought me into the fridge. Nonetheless, with a fork I devoured more than half of an order of spaghetti. I am full, now. I have nothing to be proud for today.

That's not it. She talked with me yesterday about my reaction to the blood results. She's right. I've gone to the endocrinologist. I took the tests. Now it's just waiting. Next week I might get the prescription. It might start sooner than I would have thought. The weight is no longer in the years or even months.

Why do I feel empty and hollow?

I haven't call to the laser place. I have to do that still. I received the mail for picking up the certificate of my Honor's mention. I have to make an appointment with the doctor so I get my license. I haven't gotten any news about neither of the two trips I might do this year.

After the prescription, what is it? I take my pills and then what? Just wait for the changes. It will be different, though. I will had already started with the changes. A wait before then means prolonging the change, staying here, in the limbo. After that day, the days keep counting, one by one will be increasing into weeks and months. Little by little will I change. Every step I'll be closer.

What is it, then? Why ain't I excited? Why do I feel the days so void of anything? It feels like there is nothing in here, nothing to do, to eat, to see. I came back to bed so the tomorrow could come earlier.

I told Catherine tomorrow I would call the laser place. I have to, I will. I'll make an appointment whenever they have a chance.

"Catherine, I don't know when it will happen, but would you like to be with me when I take my first pill?"

She wasn't expecting that question.

The more I think about that moment, the more I let myself be excited I get nervous and paranoid somebody is planning something to take it away from me.

## 2016-04-11

Days keep coming and going. Yesterday I lamented the hollowness of my days and the difficulty of waiting for empty days to end.

Just today I've filled my week completely. In the morning I woke up with the rays of the sun illuminating my bedroom. I was tired and exhausted, I longed for more minutes of rest. The calm of sleep and the comfort of the dark silent were seducing me with their charms. I wasn't able to sleep, though. A couple of minutes past and I gave up. It was 9, maybe a couple of minutes shy of 10. I checked for the number of the laser place, and its schedule. I could call but it was too early. I talked to Catherine and commented her my fear.

"I want to call but there is something impeding me to. I get frustrated with myself. I hate being this coward".

She told me I could call by 11;30. I stayed in the couch and watched tv. I want to eat less. I want to lose weight, be slender. I want my muscles to atrophy and disappear. I want my beard to be gone. I gathered the courage to dial the number and call. A mechanical voice in my cellphone warned me I had no credit. Right...

Those seconds gave me a chance to be caught up by my own fear. I grabbed the house phone and call from there. I have the appointment. Tomorrow noon. She offered me 11 or 12. I picked midday. She advised me to shave today. No cream or anything, just my face clean and ready. I am scared. I have been applying kanka to my mouth sore to get accustomed to the pain. "A rubber band slap to the face" they describe it. It's heat penetrating and burning a hair follicle, several at the time.

It's a little pain but it'll make this shadow disappear. It's the beard what screams masculinity. I don't mind my face, I don't even mind much of my body. It's the facial hair that I compulsively cut and hide. 8 or 10 sessions. There is a finite number to it. There is a clear start and finish. I have a date. Tomorrow I'll go and start and a couple of days or weeks later I will see the hairs shedding and falling. When they return a month later I will have another session and they will be gone, too. Every one will leave less hairs than the last, every one will be less painful, too.

I received a message in whatsapp asking if I was the Dr Ivan. I freaked out. It was just a number with a stranger's picture but I knew instantly of whom it was. It wasn't the fear of making an appointment with a patient or the potential of being abandoned again in the consultory, no, this time it was something else.

I never imagined being contacted my patients via whatsapp. I have Liliana presenting me and referring patients as the Dr. Ivan. And then they put this number on the phone and dial as I dialed to the laser place and three months ago to the endocrinologist office. Of course, as I have no credit in my phone I couldn't receive the call from the United States. So they put the number of the "Dr Ivan" in their phone and see the contact of Whatsapp of this Sofia Fernandez. I had changed the picture of me with a blouse and red lipstick to one a little more androgynous. But even then, which name appeared on their phone?

It didn't matter. I answered back and set the meeting. I'll be seeing them this thursday at 6 o'clock in Liliana's office. I have the interview ready from the last patient. I could do some research on some tests for teenagers.

This Wednesday I'll see Rene and talk to him about my meeting with the endocrinologist. I can talk of the waiting, the getting up early and getting ready. Getting lost in the traffic and then the rounds looking for a parking spot. The excruciating waiting in the waiting room, signing the initial sheet and answering the appointment as Ivan. The chat of the people outside, the change of name inside, the comments, the analysis... The day later when I would take the order with Sofia on the name. The fear and anxiety. The uncomfortable kindness of the professionals and seeing the results.

I'll have tomorrow's session to talk about, too...

What will happen? Will I endure the pain?


## 2016-04-12

"why didn't you use the doorbell?"

Several scorching hot needles penetrating and burning inside of my skin.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. I can go to the pharmacy, too. No, I have to do it. There are just two pills left. I ought to go and buy them. After that I will take Catherine out to eat. We will go to the restaurant near her house.

"Sofi, sofi, I told Enrique how you already went to the endocrinologist and he asked me where. I told him to the Hospital del Prado. 'Oh, Magallanes? Francisco Magallanes?' and he started to fangirl for him and tell me he was the best endocrinologist of Mexico and I don't know what else. So I guess you're going through a good path?"

I keep reading the stories about other people like me, the hoops they have to go through. I remember years ago when I read the procedures they kept talking about, and their first meetings with a gender specialist or an endocrinologist or their first laser session. I used to see those things so far away. Letter of recommendation, Informed Consent Clinics, blood tests...

I used to wander through the trans timelines site and looked through people's pictures. I liked looking at the ones of passing people and marvel at their changes. They non-passing one made me feel uncomfortable. I didn't even look to the first ones, I just wanted to see the results. It was as if I wanted to reassure myself that there were people who were happy, who looked fine.

Now, today, it feels so different.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene for the first time before the endocrinologist. I have the report that Rene wrote for me. I called to make an appointment with the endo. I saw him and answered his questions. He has a file of me with my name on it. I went for the blood tests, I have everything ready to start. Just today I had my first laser session. I am just a prescription away from beginning my life. After that the only thing that's left is waiting.

I made the appointment yesterday. I woke up with a fear of the pain I would have to endure. I showered and didn't know what to do with the extra time I had in the shower. I took my antidepressants and ate breakfast. I toasted one of the english muffins and fried an egg. I keep track of the food I eat in this neat app I installed on my phone. Yesterday, according to it, I ate 1650 calories. Today, with that breakfast, an apple, a popsicle and the plate of chicken salad I am still under the limit.

Will I lose weight? I want to, I want to change, the hormones will do some job but they're not magic. I don't want to depend on them. I can manage my diet and exercise. I can go to the laser and keep blasting my beard off.

I got ready and swallowed two advil before leaving home. After putting 350 of gasoline I went to the plaza. Even after stopping at the oxxo and the gas station I was way too early. There was a pharmacy in there. I asked for cell credit but said therapy instead. The lady over the counter was pretty. There was no system either. If the patient tries to call me I won't be able to answer her calls.

There is still another day before the appointment. Tomorrow I can try again.

I got the password of a wifi network and sent messages to both Catherine and Anahi. 15 minutes before my appointment I walked towards the place and hesitated to use the doorbell. I turned to wait a little longer and the lady came to open me up.


I filled this sheet to her with my information. It was weird using this name and signature so different to the last one I used last week. The session was way shorter than I thought it would be, at first a lot less painful, too.

The last places were the hardest. Under my mouth and my upper lip. There it hurt. My eyes watered and I couldn't answer her when she asked if it hurt.

This morning Jessica answered the text I sent both to them about Catherine. It made me mad. I couldn't identify what about it upset me. I shared it with Catherine.

"Hi, hi, I've been asking about her health and even apologized for not going yet. But yes, the problem was that the four of us could not agree on a time, nonetheless we will go just the two of us.
About her loneliness I think it goes deeper than just the company, but it's not my business so I won't get into that. As soon as we go, we'll tell you, ok? ;)"

## 2016-04-13

I saw Rene today. There wasn't much new that I learned this session.

This morning I didn't shave. Just a couple of minutes ago I was lying in the couch watching tv when I felt the beard getting stuck in the neck of my t-shirt. It's been weird. Since the meeting with the endocrinologist I haven't been wearing a bra every day or even applying make up. I've been dressing more androgynous even when not needed.

There was a difference, this friday being received as Sofia, labeled as her, signed with that name to yesterday when I filled the contract and signed it as Ivan.

He commented to me how I looked less anxious, more calm. It's as if everything is easier.

It is.

I showered and parked in the parking lot next to my high school. I walked the couple of blocks. I forgot to wear sunscreen. Will I be affected by the sun? Maybe my skin will stay tinted. Maybe the beard will never really fall. I won't shave tomorrow either. I have to dress formally, no, professionally, to meet the clients and their son. Or is it my client and his parents?

I put credit to my phone in the oxxo near Rene's office. I grabbed a soda from the fridge and paid for everything. "Tell me your hair isn't really like that" "Yes, it is", I answered smiling. "I'm so envious. Mine is neither here nor there".

Would had she said anything if I were wearing woman's clothes? If I had my face painted? Maybe it would had been awkward, she would be uncomfortable. Maybe she would had anyway. I didn't mind it.

Leaving Rene's office I sent a text to Paola. She wrote me in the morning telling me she had news. There will open a new master program of neuropsychology in CUT. I commented her how UABC would give me a master program for free. I considered telling her about my meeting with the specialist. I could. I wanted to.

I did walking down the stairs. "I have news, too", I had said before leaving my house.

"Yesterday I sent you a snap that I had my first laser session. I'm getting rid of my beard forever.

"Last week I had the first appointment with an endocrinologist."

She was surprised and excited for me. She supported me and offered me any help she could give me.

"It's another step that you're taking and I'm so so so proud of you and the beautiful and strong and intelligent woman you are"

I was surprised. It was a warm feeling inside of me. That is what support really is. She was kind and sincere.

I stopped by the pharmacy to buy two bottles of antidepressants. I almost lost the parking ticket. A woman touched me by the shoulder to tell me. I thanked her with my money and bottles and card and wallet in my hands. I drove to Catherine's house. It's the first time in weeks we've gone out. We went to Gourmeli, the recently renamed Pomodoro by her house.

I ate an oriental wrap with soup. She had a sandwich. I told Rene how I've been looking manly. Not manly per se, but, yeah... and it hasn't bothered me as much. I haven't shaved since Monday. Everyone today saw me as a man, for sure. This whole week.

Tomorrow I'll have the session. It will be easy. I've done it several times. It's nothing new. They're paying me to do what I know to do. Everything will be fine. There is nothing to be worried about.

We continued watching Netflix after returning to her home. Her parents and cousin were leaving to Costco. He still smiles when he sees me. Does he like me?

We touched each other. We kissed. The house was alone after her uncle finished eating and we hung her father's uniform. We lied topless in her bed, caressing each other's bodies. I finished in her hand several times. She stopped me the first time I was making her come. When I tried again, her aunt was just arriving.

There is just one episode left of the series we are watching. I think about it, me lying my head on her stomach. She surrounds me with her arm and strokes my back. We're both watching, focused. The emotions of the characters, I can feel them. I can sympathize. It's not just understanding, I can sense his loneliness and pain. It's something new for me. I love sharing this with Catherine.

## 2016-04-14

Catherine wrote a letter. It was not really a letter but a long heartfelt message. She wrote the feelings she's been hoarding for herself towards him. This idea of being lonely, the lack of reciprocity to organizing and moving plans to go see someone.

I haven't shaved still. The hairs area coarse and black. Catherine describes them as "they look burn and thick". There is something, though. I feel they're growing slower. Yeah, they are long but not a week long. And besides, I can't really see the black shadow that marks the growing root. What will happen tomorrow when I shave them off? Will the skin look softer? Will it be smooth?

I don't know what I will wear for tomorrow. I won't be able to meet Catherine and Paola in the morning. I know Paola will meet with her in her house. I was waiting for the doctor's receptionist to call me and inform me of the time of the appointment. I woke up by the alarm of the exercising app I downloaded the day before yesterday. I postponed it. I feel my body broken down, tired. Three days I've been exercising. The activities are not really hard. It's more the absence of condition because of not doing anything lately. It's just 7 minutes. 12 exercises of half a minute each. 10 seconds of rest intersecting each other.

Even that is too much. I can't lift myself from the floor. I can't raise my head to my knees. I am not strong enough, not yet. It's not really the effort the activity needs from me, it's the lack of a goal. There is no goal, just a time. In those 30 seconds I have to give the best of me. I start with my best. Almost a squad every 2 or 3 seconds. I'm exhausted by the next activity. When it's turn of the push-ups, I can't do it. I can't do only 3 in the 30 seconds. Even one is a lot of effort. I might be able to do 7, maybe 10. But if I do those, I won't be able to do the next ones.

They are just 30 seconds, but there is no goal. It's an unreachable finish line. Even 10, 12, 15, they will never be enough. With those setting I would never be able to feel victorious. It's an infinite loop of asking too much of me.

I deleted the app and started another one. This one is easier. one set of 10, then 7 of the next exercise. When the circuit finishes, it's all over again. That's it. Done.

I was washing the dishes when the phone rang. The voice of the receptionist greeted me and told me her business. She was calling to confirm the appointment of Sofia Fernandez tomorrow. The time would be 1pm.

Afternoon. It's too late. It's fine, but I won't be able to meet with Paola. I could go in the morning to Cathy's house. Then, in the noon I would drive to the hospital, maybe the pharmacy and pick Catherine up. From there we could go to the school and to our own house next. It would be three different trips to her house.

The most convenient thing to do is just go directly to the Hospital in the noon. I will give him the results and we will talk about them, he might prescribe me something or explain me the treatment. He maybe will ask me some questions or I don't know. Tomorrow I'll see.

I wanted to go to the university to pick up the invitations if the ceremony of my Honor's mention. This time Catherine won't be my invited. Will my mom go or my dad?

I told my mother I would go today but didn't. The plan was going tomorrow with Catherine, I could wait in line for both our turns. She could verify her documents and I ask for the invitations. From there we would be even.

I am scared... no, it's not fear. I am nervous, excited of tomorrow. I didn't feel comfortable thinking about that because I had the meeting with the parents today. I wanted to get past that before thinking of what would come next.

Now it's done. I finished the interview. I have all the data I need to start looking for and gathering the tests. Next week the application will start. Tests. Family, personality, maybe intelligence.

Tomorrow. Tomorrow we will see Misfits again.

Will tomorrow start the counter again? I don't want to wait for them, expect them. I fear that the more I want them, the larger is the possibility of they not coming.

But I want them, and I expect them, even if I don't want to admit it to myself.

## 2016-04-15

I, again, was nervous waiting to enter and meet him. My appointment was at 1pm. I woke up and showered. Yesterday I wore my long curly hair in a masculine bun. Green pants I haven't worn in a year and a shirt, was the attire I chose. I hadn't shaved either. My beard was days long. It was more than a stubble. Naturally Liliana kept calling me boy and guy. Ivan. There was a situation with the mother and my contact information.

The whole week, this whole week, since Monday that I called to make the appointment with the laser place. Since that shave I had not presented feminine. Today I shaved that week-long beard. I had read how the shadow after the laser sessions is darker, more noticeable. I didn't care. I had my appointment with the endocrinologist today. There was a possibility of today starting hormones. I took a picture with my camera in front of the mirror. In my plans about today I contemplated the idea of going to the pharmacy to buy them.

So there I was, looking for a parking spot. Everywhere was taken. I parked even further away from last week. There was no weird sights. No head turnings. I felt fine. Again, I entered through the wrong door.

I asked the receptionist about my appointment 20 minutes before the time. I knew I would wait. It was fine. I sat and waited.

There were lots of people outside, pharmaceutical sellers, I guess. A woman, older, with a younger one were seated beside me.

When the clocked marked 1, I started getting anxious with every sound I heard from the other side of the door. The first time the receptionist opened the door, it was to call the other woman. I kept waiting. There were another 15 minutes before she opened the door for me.

I was nervous about the results. He welcomed me and we started.

Of course, the glucose and cholesterol. It was alarming, surprising, abnormal. He asked some questions. I answered honestly. He checked the glucose level with a little aparatus of his. Another prick. I wasn't scared. I took it. It didn't hurt, I almost didn't even feel it.

When we returned to the desk he continued. He grabbed another order for studies and started filling it. I would need another one before starting with the treatment. He wrote his cellphone number in a little card and gave it to me. I was going to do the test directly from the hospital. I didn't need fasting. After the results we could agree on another meeting monday or tuesday.

He talked a little about my options of blockers. "Your testosterone is a little high, we will block it with effort". There is the option of the gonadotropine blockers, to affect directly the Luteinizant hormone and cancel the creation of the testosterone. It's an injection once a month or every three months and the taking of the estrogen. The thing is that the medication is expensive.

I've been growing more accustomed to the idea of injections but I don't think I'm really ready for that.

I was dressed and made up. Even then, I decided to come home and pick up the discount card. The drive wasn't long. I got there and this time there were almost no anxiety. I was waiting for them to see what they'd put this time on the sheet. I didn't think about them recognizing me. Of course they would. How many transgender patients would they get? How many of us are even here?

"A man with a woman's name". This time there was no awkwardness. Did the phlebotomist recognize me? Was she the same one? She welcomed me with a smile as I entered. After paying and sorting everything out, she invited me in. She always used feminine pronouns. She was kind and nice. For minute, I actually forgot feeling like a freak. Did she wrote the Masc in gender or was the other woman checking my information from the computer?

She asked me some questions and then drew my blood. This time it was only a little bottle. It was over before I knew it. The results will be ready tomorrow morning. I want to wake up early and pick them up myself.

I drove from there to Catherine's house. I discarded completely the idea of going to the university. I was, I guess, a little disappointed. That's what I feared mostly.

Chevo and Jessica were already there.

"Oh, Ivan, I didn't know who was entering"

Chevo and Jessica told us what's been up lately. They almost broke up.

I told them about my analysis. Jessica asked directly what they were for and I lied to her. Why did I do that?

I could had told her. I decided not to. It's my decision, but even then, why do I feel guilty?

## 2016-04-16

I picked up the results. The alarm was set for 8 in the morning and then every thirty minutes. My father came home late at night with Luis and I assume he went even later to pick Miguel up from his party. It was naÃ¯ve to think I would had needed to race for the bathroom.

I wanted to shave, I thought about wearing make up. Why? I discarded the idea. I did shave. A couple of black spots came with the water rinsed from the razor. That wasn't enough, though.

I was nervous as I drove there. I had to wake up my father and ask him to move the car. Exiting his bedroom he asked me "where are you going?" "I'll pick up the test results from yesterday.

I was nervous as hell. I had told Catherine, it wasn't the idea of being diabetic that scared me. Not really. I went twice in a week to draw blood. I think I passed that fear. It's not the needles that scare me. It was the risk of not being able to change. Being delayed again. Maybe he would tell me that I need to lower my glucose level for a few months before starting.

I thought about a hundred things in the couple of minutes I drove. I parked a couple of spaces ahead of the lab. I wasn't dressed femininely but I wasn't in guy's clothes either. There were more people than yesterday afternoon, but there were fewer workers. There was no guard in the door and just a woman behind the counters. She was attending somebody and I hesitated at the door. She looked at me and said "I'll be with you (masculine) in a moment".

It was a cold slap, not hurting, just, alarming. I sat and waited.

I gave her my card and receipt. I went back to my seat. She just printed the results. I was nervous still but it was a weird kind of anxiety.

She came to me, didn't call me. The receipt and card were behind the envelope. There were no exchange of words. It was like a mutual secret. Like a guarding of a secret information. Is this it? Is my own identity a secret? Why didn't I go as a girl like yesterday? I keep blaming the beard but that's not really it. My body is masculine, my face and complexion are those of a man.

I started laser, I have written the date of the next appointment for a second session. I have to be patient. It will be a slow change. I know the shadow is darker, I know I won't note a lot of changes in the firsts sessions.

I am desperate for starting the hormonal treatment, the feminization of my body and appearance.

I am not diabetic. My glucose level is high still, yet the hemoglobin AC1 level was below the diagnostic range and even lower than the risk factor.

I am ok, I guess. I'll keep watching what I eat and drinking mostly water. What will he say, though?

He told me to send him a text when I got the results to ask him if he saw them. If he did or not, he would look at them and then set an appointment with me monday or tuesday. And so I did. I sent the text before leaving for the United States. He answered back a couple of cars before the border. That was the last answer I got from him. I sent him a response telling him I would be in San Ysidro so I might lose the signal. When I returned I sent him the last one telling him I was back and if he could not get the lab results I would send them to him by mail.

I fear being too pushy. But, honestly, I am scared. I am nervous. I talk about it lightly with my parents, and yeah, I remember a couple years ago when being diabetic would be hell to me. Now it's scary but not that much. I am more scared about being literally trapped in this appearance.

In the mail I got the package. I was expecting a box, but instead it was just a plastic envelope. I finally have the bag. I can stop using the one from high school. This is mine.

We went to Costco and Target. I ate a salad and chicken nuggets.

Catherine is in Mexicali.

"We went to the plaza today. I entered a store with my mom. When I exited my dad said he saw a really weird gay wearing woman's clothes. "well, a man completely going as a woman, but with a man's butt"

I felt this cold slap again. An electric pulse from the tip of my toes crawling all the way to my hands.

"He always makes comments like in a joke manner, the tone, without a hurting intention, like in a fun way to him. Today he was serious, like for himself"



## 2016-04-17

What was it that brought me down today?

I slept a couple of hours just now. My uncle and aunt came to my house with my cousins. There was an alarm in the morning, 6am, maybe. I returned to bed and continued my sleep after the bathroom trip and seeing that my father came with his coffee and there was no breakfast.

It was fine, I fried myself an egg and toasted and english muffin. I felt fine, there was no tiredness nor hopelessness. Yesterday I got no answer from the endocrinologist. I sent him three messages and got a response just from the first one. I am nervous about my results. What do they mean? They were urgent. He told me to do them just then. There was urgency in his voice. He gave me his cellphone. Why would he do that? He would tell me to see him monday or tuesday.

I sent him a text message in the morning and his answer was that he didn't had them yet.

Do I call him? Do I send him another one? Do I call his secretary? Why didn't he just tell me to set a meeting next week?

I feel the wait as crushingly and heavy as the three months I waited in the beginning. It's different, though. Then, I knew when they would end. Now there is nothing else, the next time I'll see him it's almost sure that I will get a prescription.

I don't have diabetes. My blood sugar is high but I'm not diabetic.

My beard looks the same, darker even. It's frustrating. What it if no change happened? Was the pain for naught? It's just been a week. Less than that. All the forums talk about shedding occurring in the first couple of weeks. They don't even mention the first session.

Why am I so desperate?

Next week I'll go to the university. I have to set the appointment with the dr. to check my papers. I will pick up the invitations to the ceremony to give me my Honor's mention. That worthless piece of paper that just gives me extra reasons to be pitied by not getting a job.

In a week the Game of Thrones show will start again. I might see Misfits with Catherine in her house, too.

Wednesday I'll talk with Rene. I can tell him about my next visit to the endo, I will tell him about the urgent texts and the shame of contacting in his personal phone.

Thursday I'll be having the first testing session with Hiram. That fourteen year old boy. I haven't looked for the tests I will apply to him.

I'll be getting paid. I have been looked for my services. I should talk with Catherine about going to the university tomorrow.

She at first told me how she thought I was exaggerating with the results of my first tests. "Being pre-diabetic". I am not fat. I am just overweight. I remember the reactions of my godmother and Jessica when we were in Las Vegas. 200 pounds was marked in the gigantic weight scale of the restaurant. I was the first person to weight themselves. "No, it has to be wrong, you don't weight that much".

I do. I did, I knew that.

So, me freaking out about being sick, about having a reason for being denied treatment, it was the nightmare I was so hoping to not meeting. Maybe she took it personal. She weights more than me. I am freaking out about this health condition, does it mean that I consider her extra un-healthy?

I am still tired. I want to return to bed and continue sleeping. I don't know what to do to make time crawl a little faster. But what will it do? I had my second appointment two days ago. I should had started the day before yesterday. I am on extra time. Because of my blood, because of those numbers. Is it the food I eat? Is it the drinks?

What can I do?

I didn't do today's exercises. What will happen if I skip a day, will I be able to do them tomorrow?

Catherine told me I could just wait until tomorrow for his call. It's the weekend. He doesn't care about his patients these couple of days.

After that, if I get nothing, I could call the receptionist and make another meeting. I won't be a first patient. I might get a closer one than the end of May.

But, but... I don't know.

"If you don't want to wait, you could just call him directly, by phone, by voice, then you would get your answer instantly."

And I feel I am free falling with nowhere to grasp myself.

## 2016-04-18

He is not ignoring me. He is not abandoning me as a patient. A couple of non responded messages don't mean I will never see him again.

What is it that scares me about talking to his secretary? I fear the appointment will be far away. The first time I called she asked me first if I was a first time patient before telling me the date.

After the first meeting, he told me to say to her to put me for Friday. He picked the day. I might just wait a couple of days more, it might be a week, it might be months.

Waiting for him to answer meant seeing him today or tomorrow. There is no chance still of me receiving a call from him to see him tomorrow. So it doesn't matter.

I want to stay in the present, for a moment I want to forget the past and ignore the future. Can I focus for once on how I am feeling just now?

This is life, not what I've lived nor what awaits for me. Just now. Here.

I feel sad and tired. It's barely 9 o'clock and my head hurts. I'm reclined in my chair. I keep a glass of water with me right now, it's the fifth of today.

I think of Catherine. She asks me if there is something she can do to make me feel better. And I honestly don't know.

What do I want? I want someone to come and hold me. I want her to tell me by the ear that I look fine. No.

I want to know that I will change soon enough. But that's not true either.

I think about hearing how I am who I am. People seeing me how I should be seen. How I want to look.

Today I shaved. No, I have my face clean shaven. My mother knows now the date of the ceremony of the university. Will she go with me?

I'm drifting to the future.

I have a credential with my name and an envelope with the last results of my blood tests. In there it says Sofia Fernandez and in Sex, Masculine is marked. That's who I am now.

Talking about the past is talking about the man I no longer am. Talking about the future is talking about the woman I not yet am.

Who am I?

The phlebotomist talked to me nicely and with kindness. She spoke to me as if I were not a freak. Or didn't she? She was comfortable and used feminine pronouns. She made conversation and heard my answers. Was her kindness pity? Did she want to be nice to the little freak everyone talked about last week. Maybe she felt bad about what somebody said: that young person with a female name.

I am thinking about the past again. And just now I might start writing about the wait for the next meeting or how tomorrow I will call to the receptionist and what I will say to her.

Why do I keep running away from the now? Does it scare me? Does it scare to know how I feel this moment? How I look?

The little hairs start shedding today. The first one came when I rubbed my upper lip before showering. Now my face is clean shaven, but there still are some dark spots. Will they fall? I can see the first changes.

And yet I am not happy for the couple that have fallen already. No, I am excited for the ones that will disappear.

So what? I might see the endocrinologist soon, and yeah, I'll go to the pharmacy and buy the pills and then take them. Another couple of pills that I'll swallow everyday routinely, a new daily habit that I'll cultivate. And what will I do then? Wait. Wait for more changes to come. Wait for my testosterone to drop, to the hairs to stop growing, wait for my face to change and my body, too.

Isn't waiting what I am doing just now?

This Thursday I will start with the application.

The glass is still almost full. The ice cubes have all faded away.

I put on a small t-shirt today, gray like the one I am wearing. It didn't fit. I'm bigger. I'm still broad. Today I did double the exercise. today's and yesterday's.

Why do I feel like I will let Rene down?

I wanted to tell him how I had started already. I haven't. I told him I felt better and more secure and confident. Now I feel worse than this whole month.

A whole day stands between now and then.

## 2016-04-19

I called again today. The clock in the phone said 8 in the morning when I was fully awake. I just awaited for the right time. Maybe somebody would be there. Maybe they would not open until later in the morning. I waited still.

A couple of minutes past 10 I dialed the number of the business card. I was nervous. What date would they give me? I heard talking about lasts of may. I rehearsed the words I would use the night before. And like a character I said my lines when a female voice answered the phone.

She asked for my name and phone number. She would give the endo my message and later would he return my call. I kept the phone in hand in case he would do it soon enough. By noon I was already thinking on a backup plan. At what time could I call him directly to his phone? 6pm. I could calculate that he would stop seeing patients in the afternoon. 6 would be late enough to assume he's free and yet sufficiently early to not worry about getting him busy in his personal life.

I was bad. I felt frustrated and down and ridden of every bit of energy and will.

Hilda was the one to send the first message. She shared with me the page of the newspaper where my name appeared in a list of the names of people awarded. Luz was in there, too. I asked her if she had gotten any news about our trip. No. She had lost all hope. Samantha said she went two months after her test. A lot more than that has past since ours.

I knew confidently that that wasn't exactly true. The ceremony of the exam of november was much more late than the midsummer one. I thought about looking for the one of last year, compare the dates. When I got in the page of the organization that makes the test, I realized that the date marked in the bottom hasn't occurred yet.

I sorted the names and there we were. Me, with the Fs, lower down was she and a little lower was Ana. The trip won't be in the capital as I had thunk. It will be actually in Jalisco, where I have gone before. Zapopan, the ends of May. Probably Catherine won't come with me this time. It's ok. Hilda talked a little about getting a bus and going somewhere near. We could pay just the return fare and visit somewhere near.

It's not the same planning it knowing Catherine won't be by my side. Knowing nobody there will actually know my name.

I made myself a sandwich of chicken salad and ate the first half watching television. The other half made me a little sick. I could think of nothing else besides the lack of answer by the doctor. Was he ignoring me? I had to talk about it, but with whom?

Tomorrow I will see Rene. I could tell him. It's just another day. Why did I want to take the hormones before seeing him again?

I sent Anahi a message. He might just be busy. He is an imminence in his field. The wait time between my call and my first appointment was of three months. Not even a week has passed. I had no reason to be scared.

I feared he would call me and tell me he could no longer treat me. Maybe he would just abandon me as a patient. I would have to start all over again. Just thinking, writing about it made the tears roll and jump from my cheeks to the pillow bellow me.

By four in the afternoon I was in the computer looking some tests to apply to my patient when I heard the ringtone. There was an unsaved number in the screen and the app marked Francisco Magallanes below. I answered in a high voice. The voice that received me was the one of the receptionist. It wasn't the same one that took my message. She was looking for Sofia. The doctor could see me tomorrow by 12:30, was it ok by me?

Yeah, of course. I could cancel my session with Rene. After seeing him I would no longer need it. I sent him a text message. I didn't want to dial another number. After sending the message the phone rang again. No, it would be thursday instead of tomorrow, yeah, the same time.

Rene answered me back. I apologized and told him that I could see him.

Yesterday my dad called home. Everyone who calls always asks who is the one speaking. Is it Luis? Miguel? Me? Yesterday my dad asked, too.

"Who is it, Laura?"



## 2016-04-20

Tomorrow I will go to the endocrinologist. He sent me for another blood test. The blood test marks everything normal. Rene asked me too about the results. He said those were fine. "Do you think he will start you tomorrow?" I don't know. I honestly don;t know.

I still feel a little guilty about my pressuring texts. He doesn't know how I was so desperate for his call. In his eyes I sent him only 4 text messages and a phone call to his office. The first one doesn't count because he asked for it. The second one was a response to his answer. The third one an offer. The fourth was monday, the first day of our potential meeting after a weekend of silence. The phone call was the last one. I called to his office and not his personal number, that should count for something. Will he be upset? He might be a little angry and maybe regretful of giving me his cellphone.

Today I had my therapy session. I put on a t-shirt and the jogger pants. I'm still wearing Mickey mouse on my torso.

In the morning I opened the cellphone and did the exercises of the daily app. I haven't printed the tests to apply tomorrow. I didn't confirm either. I guess Liliana had confirmed already or will tomorrow. My meeting with him won't be until the mid after-noon. I still feel the soreness of my abs.

Tomorrow I'll see him, he will see me and say something to me. Will he give me the prescription now? Today is April 20th, tomorrow will be exactly two weeks since I saw him for the first time. Will I go to the pharmacy tomorrow? Am I still scared of being excited? I can't think of a reason why would he deny me treatment. I explained to Rene how his sense of urgency felt to me related to the idea of starting me now. He even took sometime to explain to me the options of the anti-androgens.

Even now I still feel this need of avoiding the subject. I want to talk about something else. What else did I do today? What another thing could I write about? I have soon the ceremony in the university, I have to confirm to the EGEL site that I plan to go to Zapopan.

Am I nervous about tomorrow? The other thing tomorrow, the one with the patient. The thing I keep postponing. I will get paid, though. That is always good.

Today I visited Catherine after my therapy. I talked with Rene about yesterday, about this weekend. Why do I check and supervise my own feelings? I was relieved of having the appointment and a date unto which to place my waiting focus. And yet it was "bad", because I was desperate and hysterical and childish.

But I truly was scared and sad and upset.

I don't give myself permission to get excited and want it now. Because I'm scared of being denied. I'm scared of not getting it. And then what? What will happen when I finally get the prescription and start the treatment, then what? Will I give myself permission to be happy and enjoy it? Will expecting changes will magically mean that I won't get them? Should I stay stoically apathetic to the changes I will be experiencing?

Tomorrow I will be alone with the patient. Projective tests, Dass 21 and the self-perception one.

Everything is set. I should not be nervous. I am ready. I like this.

I talked with Catherine today about how she is not. She is having her existential crisis. She doesn't like her career. She doesn't see herself working with this, doing her job. I was scared again. I could see her doubts, her paralysis. What if she stays this way? What if she has to stay? Will I go anyway?

I am scared of living in Mexico alone. I am scared of looking for a place to live and out myself the firsts weeks because my id says a name and my face screams another. I am scared of doing the process of getting into the master and then having to explain "my situtation".

I want her to be with me, I want her to help me. I wan her company and support. I need her.

What if she needs something else? What if she can't? Will I be able to live my own life without her? Without anyone?

Will I be able to finally live?

## 2016-04-21

I feel my nails long and awkward. I have been having them likes this since a long time, more than I week. Why is it until now that they started to bother me?

I could feel the throbbing pain of my abs in the night. Every turn under mu sheets was a flinching prick inside my navel. This morning the app was merciful. A couple of squats, that was it. My legs are muscular, I've never had problems with them. My arms are not strong. I am a little bulk. I should be fat like Miguel, maybe it's my testosterone what makes it so easy for me to gain muscle. Testosterone can turn into estrogen. Is that why I look kinda feminine?

He didn't ask for the estrogen in the blood test. Today I saw him finally.

I woke up this morning with the meeting in mind. I even forgot about my patient. I was going to the hospital and return home. After a couple of hours I would be back out again. I worked. I gave him some tests, I have four tests to interpret now. Two of the easiest and two more qualitative.

Do I even have the manual for them?

I was not going to confirm. They would meet with Liliana before me, she would confirm the appointment. If they were to no show up, she would just tell me.

Why am I avoiding the most important part of today? It's what I've been thinking and feeling. It was a rollercoaster. I will remember this day. This one, today, is the first day of my life. I'm a "transsexual" person now, in the local definition of the word. I've started transition. I took the pills with Catherine. I was on her bed, she gave me the water.

As soon as I got up from bed, I picked the clothes I would wear. They had to be something feminine enough to be seen as a woman in the pharmacy, but masculine enough to be seen as a man by the patient in the afternoon.

It's been weeks since I've worn a shirt and an undershirt underneath. I picked the red one. A matching pair of underwear of the same color. I have only one pair of clean jeans. They are man's but skinny enough to be ambiguous. I grabbed the black bra. I took all of the garments but the shirt with me to the bathroom. I laid them over the toilet. When I opened the door of my parent's bedroom to grab the towel I saw my mother lying in bed using her ipad.

"You didn't go to school" I affirmed her waiting for an answer. Today was the preschool teacher's day. I returned downstairs for the shirt.

I showered and shaved and curled my hair with my fingers and softened my face with make up. I hid in my room although I had no reason to. My mother knows about me. Why did I avoid her?

She saw me anyway. A couple of minutes before I was supposed to leave she opened the door and told me she was leaving. Did she notice? Maybe.

I used the correct door now. The guard asked me to sign in his sheet. At first I was scared that I would be asked for an id. The lady that came behind me told the man how she was seeing the dr Magallanes on the 12:20. She had her appointment before mine. I entered first, though.

The receptionist welcomed me. She recognized me before I even said a word. "Take a seat, Sofi, the dr will see you in a minute".

He explained the results to me, talked a little about them, asked me about my daily routine and then just gave me my prescription. He prescribed me some pills of diverse types of estrogen, anticonceptive pills for the cyproterone and spironolactone. He knew my testosterone is on the roof. Even then the dosage is really low. I'll see him in 8 weeks. June 16th, noon.

I'll be two months on hormones by the time I'd see him again.

I know the cyproterone can worsen my depression. Was that the reason I started being anxious about the dosage? What if after two months nothing changed? What if the testosterone stay high and the estrogen just flows through my system? Will these two months be in vain?

No. I have started. They will do something.

Rest for 4 days a month. He's the expert, he's the endocrinologist who went to Harvard. I'm not even a med student.

I should trust him. Just trust him and wait.

Will I do the new Facebook page as I said?

## 2016-04-22

I woke up with the same 2 days old pain in the abs. It was early. I had put the alarm clock to wake me by 9 in the morning. I opened my eyes without its work. Today no sounds came from it. It was not needed. The exercise of today consisted in chest, push ups, three different kinds. Two circuits of three types of push ups, 7 each. 21 each circuit, 42 in total.

Damn...

I did the exercise first. I ate breakfast, I need it for this kind of pills. The dose is low enough, my body best absorb it as efficient as it can. I didn't fry an egg or something like that, those kinds of elaborate breakfasts I used to do. Even now, after returning from Catherine, the usual thing would be to see what they ate, look at the food and consider it. Of course I would not just eat, but sure I could try. There are two boxes of pizza. One slice would make no difference. How many calories would a single slice have? 200? 300? It's nothing. If I can eat one, I sure could eat two.

I ate a bowl of cereal. It wasn't the special k I bought. I grab half a bowl of the Honey Bunches of oats. The rest of the milk that was in the container. I put an episode of Orphan Black and saw it lying in the couch. Until then did I took my pills. Forty milligrams of fluoxetine, twenty five milligrams of spironolactone, a little over half a milligram of a composites of estrogen, and a pill of a combination of estrogen and cyproterone.

Catherine is right, I have started treatment. I feel like I'm cheating as I say that I've started. The dosage is even lower than the low ones I've seen on the internet. He said it himself: "we will have to really block your high levels of testosterone".

I am just starting, these are the first months. It's just a start. I just need to have the levels of a woman. That's hard to accomplish when even now I have twice or even three times as much the testosterone as a random guy.

Yesterday as I checked the order for the blood tests I could see the option to check the estrogen levels. I could just mark it. Maybe I could send him a text asking him if I can. I just want to know how I am. I know the dosage is really low and first we have to abolish the testosterone, but I am just curious. May I order it?

I remember the "low" doses some people start with, 50 milligrams of spironolactone, 1mg of estradiol. I am at half of those. Half a milligram, half the lowest dose of spironolactone. He gave me some cypro, too. But even that it's low. 2 milligrams. 20 is the given, sometimes 12, or 10. Just a fifth.

I am scared of checking my blood and seeing nothing changed. A high number of T and just an unknown value of E. Would these two months be for naught?

Is it normal that I am this anxious and worried?

I saw somebody who said he was with a similar dosage of mine for a month. Mine it's just double of that. Two months, after those if the levels are the same I can ask him, tell him that the dosage is low, maybe try something higher.

Is it stupid that at the same time that I'm doubting its effects, I'm wondering if these feelings are even caused by them?

I know the estrogen will make me moody. I will cry with more easiness, I might get irritated. The cypro has the secondary effect of causing depression, even more with people like me who have a history of it.

I should distract myself. I've started. Even if they work or not, I have started. At least I won't continue to get manlier. I can lose weight, I can take care of myself. Get my body used to the medication, get my mind ready to the idea.

I picked Catherine up at her house. We drove to the school. She got checked her papers, now we are even. Monday we might call the dr to make an appointment.

I picked up the pictures and the ring. The graduation is finally over. Melissa gave us her card. She has one patient, like me.

I might not be wasting that much time.

Just one day at a time. Thing about a thing at a time. It's 8 weeks until I can do something. I might just wait and enjoy this bursts of calmness that I sometimes get.

## 2016-04-23

Days keep passing by but nothing new has happened. I woke up today in the same bed with the same mood. If we had gone to the United States I might have bought the pill organizer. Will I keep forgetting to take the pills?

I just told Catherine, I feel moody and sad but I don't know why. Is it what I've been thinking about the dosage? Is it the secondary effects of the dropped Testosterone cause by the spironolactone? Maybe it's the emotional effects of the estrogen, or the depression induced by the cyproterone.

It could be millions of things. And yet it feels naive to think that the hormones are even doing something to me.

Am I subtracting importance and value to my accomplishments? When I was in high school or even younger, I would have been super excited about being awarded nationally. I will travel and receive a medal and shit. And now I see it as an inconvenience.

I couldn't find anything to do, I even played videogames with Luis. Super smash bros, Mario Kart. I sat with him in his room and played. Several times the idea of telling him crossed my mind. "Luis, I am transgender".

Just like that, no melodramatic explanations or circling around with questions. He knows what a trans person is. I could bet he even imagines it or wonders about me. I didn't.

My mother asked about my appointment with the dr. So the results were fine, she asked. Did he prescribed me something for the cholesterol?

She always picks the worst of times. Were we alone or just my parents I would had told her. "No, I'm fine about that, the result was normal. He prescribed me something, though. A medication to lower my testosterone. I have it pretty high. Even for male standards"

I could say something about the estrogen. No, just that. It's not that it's a secret. Why didn't I just say it then? It is a secret. I hid the information.

Why does it scare me to talk about it? I made the Facebook profile and yet I haven't put even the profile picture or the basic information.

Trying to distract myself I started interpreting the tests. Both the questionnaires are graded. I even decided to create some spreadsheet in excel. I looked for the NEO IP in the web. Or I could just use the 50 item open one form the International personality Item poll.

Do the rest of psychologists do things like this? Do they research about tests and psychometric qualities and statistical analysis? Do they even look for new tests besides the ones they're taught?

And yet they are offered jobs and promotions and opportunities.

I, on the other hand, am still unemployed. I haven't looked, though. It's been weeks since I've sent a Curriculum. I could even design a business card, just the name and telephone. Upgrade my own CV. Give it some color and formality. Quit the bullshit and write what I actually know and do, what differs me from the rest of graduates.

I am successful. I will be awarded the Scholar Merit by the end of this month. I will be given plane tickets and a hotel stay to receive a medal for having an almost perfect score in national test.

I know I can apply and have high probabilities to be accepted by a major university in a postgraduate program.

I can do lots of things. I have lots of merits. Will being trans make them useless? Will I be able to use this to gain pity points?

"I graduated best of my class, always an excellency in the academic world. After traveling to receive my award I'm still unemployed and homeless because of my gender identity."

What a stupid thought.

I have started hormones, in 8 weeks I will meet with the doctor and see my progress. Even if the testosterone is still in the same level I can argue for a different approach.

It's not like I'm wasting time. I am taking the medication. I am having the laser sessions. I can see some patches in the black forest that is my face. Today when Telcel called again to offer their services I was referred as Miss.

I can modulate my voice, I can be called by the feminine in the pharmacy when waiting to be attended. Sure, I'm still gendered masculine a whole bunch of times. But I am getting half the dosage other people start with, and yet, I keep forgetting that I have been gendered female even months before starting.



## 2016-04-24

I am tired, still. I woke up early today, too. Did I had an erection in the night? It's almost usual to feel a little turned on in the first hours of the day, hiding in that semiconscious state of the mind. Was I conscious enough to miss it?

The door of the backside of my room stays open so the morning light can wake me. Was it six or seven when I was fully awake? I slid my hand into my underwear, it was flaccid and sleep. Are the hormones making an effect or is it all in my head? I kept stroking it to see what would happen. Without intention my respiration started accelerating and my body tensing. I could to it later.

I put the green cover on the floor and looked for today's routine. It was just a warm up, so I finished it quickly. More than a week I've finished the daily exercise. Maybe this will end up being an unbroken habit.

I haven't shaved either. I've forgot when the last time was. Was it thursday that I met with the patient and the endocrinologist? Friday I went with Catherine to the university to get the pictures. Did I shave that day? Which would I prefer? This growth could be the one of three days or just two. As I rub my face I can continue seeing the black short dead hairs in my fingers. It's encouraging and rewarding. I can see, also, the blank patches of smooth skin that appear somewhere around my face.

Just 8 weeks and I'll know the effects of the hormones. Next session I will talk to him, ask him questions and tell him my worries.

Next Friday I'll receive the Honor's mention in my school. That little paper that says how I was the highest grade in my generation, just like the one Magallanes has on his wall.

Yesterday I told myself I would start designing the business cards I could use to gain clients.

Yesterday I finished the sheets for the tests, the projective ones are still undone. Nonetheless, I already found the english version of the BFNE, and have the items of the NEO IPIP. I have a test for the vocational orientation. And the ISRA I can apply it in the original spanish. The Beck inventory is the only one that's missing, but I know it will be the easiest to find.

This week... Tomorrow I'll see Game of Thrones with Catherine here. We will eat somewhere close. Wednesday I have my therapy and the patient. I haven't decided yet which of the tests will I give him. Tomorrow I have to call the dr to make an appointment for him to check my papers, finally. I will send a text to Liliana to confirm the change of session.

The business cards stay saved in the webpage. There are four designs in there. Two with the name of Ivan Fernandez, and two with Sofia Fernandez.

Both feel fake and artificial. Every phone call I get is a wrong one. Now it is amusing to answer the phone and be gendered feminine. Is it because they hear a woman's voice or an effeminate one?

Rene told me how he didn't recognize me that first time.

Friday I will have to dress formally and go to the ceremony. Will my dad go or will my mother? In there I won't know anybody but Luz or Paloma, whichever goes.

How many of us will be there? Will they give me something else besides the free postgraduate?

Everyone in Hiram's drawing is wearing a t-shirt but his father. His father's hands are hidden behind his back. His eyes are open and blank. His hair is shaded and his head covered in the drawn hoodie.

It's interesting and yet I don't care about it. I don't like grading these.

My facebook profile is still empty. There is not even a profile picture nor the basic information.

I hear Catherine's thoughts and feelings and they worry me. I doubt that she will accompany me to the capital. She is stuck in an arrested development. The idea of working her career doesn't do anything to her. She doesn't want to leave home. She is scared of telling her parents about her.

I can't blame her. I am scared of her telling them about me. Her father is nice to him. He is not aggressive or hateful to her gay friends.

But yet, I am neither her firend nor gay.

## 2016-04-25

And I saw her cry like I had years before in her own car after a chat. She turned and looked straight at me, an innocent smile, like a child who's confessing his crime. She's about the let it out, I can see it in her face. It's like containing all of it inside is tiring her. She explodes like a full dam, the whole river comes.

I picked her up after noon.

"When do you have your next appointment with the laser place?... It didn't work, it looks even darker than before." I haven't shaved, even today. Yesterday I was fine with it, I even let Catherine see it in person, see it and touch it. This morning it started to upset me. It's just another day. Tomorrow I'll take it off. It's almost a week of the hormones. The days keep passing by. The day after tomorrow I will see my patient. I will see Rene, too. That day will be a complete week. Just two more days. Thursday will be the start of the second and then, the next day, I will go to the first ceremony. Just one people of every generation of each career gets this award. From the faculty, just two of us will be from this semester, four from the whole year. It will be more exclusive than the one in Mexico.

Me and Luz. For the one in Jalisco, both Hilda and Ana will go, too. That's exactly a month after the first ceremony. A month in between. By then I might had finished the evaluation and their report. Will Liliana recommend me to other patients?

From there I will return the last day of May, half a month later, two weeks and I'll take the third blood test. I'll know if these two months were for naught.

I showered today before leaving. I put on the hipster t-shirt of glasses and a mustache. There are haris of the same length of my beard in my chest and stomach. I haven't shaved those neither. Do they bother me?

It's common this feeling of doubt after the calm. I experienced it, too, with the antidepressants. I feel better so I might not actually need this. I can't have it both ways. Either I doubt their effects or overvalue them.

From her house I picked her and returned to mine. We stopped in the oxxo of the neighborhood. She put credit to her phone and I bought beverages and snacks. Since yesterday I've been meaning to watch the first episode of Game of Thrones. We sat in the couch together and watched it. After the hour finished, I put Netflix for her, the next episode of Misfits.

We ate in the same burger place near home. Neither one of us ordered burgers. She asked for a sandwich and I for a burrito. We talked about Chevo and Jessica's relationship, about ours. I talked about what my mother told me her psychologist friend had told her. The antidepressants are dangerous, I should be careful, there are other ways.

I ate a weekend biscuit for breakfast with the pills. I did the daily exercise. Yeah, I ate almost a whole bag of chips, too, but after the meal I don't intend to eat anything today. This whole week I've been drinking water. Will I lose weight? Do I want to?

We kept talking about our future. Living together, moving to the capital. What will happen next year? We chatted about nicknames and memories of our high school days. Old remembrances of distant friends. Anecdotes of an almost forgotten past.

"Three years ago would I even imagine I'd be taking hormones?"

Two years ago I was in Spain and wanted exactly this. Me from two years ago would be proud of me and what I've done. Would a younger me recognize me?

Would I even recognize a me from two years in the future? Will I even be alive in three years?

Am I the same person who was alive before now? Was I even alive?

I dreamed with Monica again. There were no sex or kisses or nothing that I would be embarrassed to tell anyone. I can't remember exactly what happen. Was there pity or sadness? Were we talking? Why do I keep thinking of her? Yesterday Catherine brought her up. No, it was me. I think it's her whenever the notification of "morriquis" shows up in the phone. "I thought you were talking."

No. That was a month ago.

I have an app to take count of the days since I started hormones and since I last masturbated, but her? I guess now I really don't care.

## 2016-04-26

I woke up earlier than usual. It was near 4 in the morning when I stepped up from bed with a stomachache and full bladder. Yesterday I had set up the pillows in that comfortable and cozy way I discovered last year. This was supposed to be a recuperating and restful slumber. After the bathroom trip I returned and came back to my sleepy state. For a couple hours I rested.

Now I am with a cup of hot chocolate and an opened package of cookies. They're non-sugared. Almonds and cinnamon flavored. I could had told my father about this morning's call. I decided not to tell my mother, let it better be a surprise. Would she expect it? No. Why would she?

I woke again with that same ill feeling inside. Was it nausea? Maybe an ill-effect of the pills? I didn't feel the motivation to get up and do the exercise. Not even eat breakfast and take the pills. I postponed the first alarm from 8 to 9. The third one of 10 was the one who didn't play because of the income call. I was awake already. The app identified the number and marked the logo of the university, even then I answered with a female voice. No, a neutral one. They asked for Ivan Fernandez and I kept the call.

She was calling because of this friday's ceremony, I had received the e-mail, and maybe picked up the invitation. I answered before letting her finish. Yeah, I had already. She was calling, she continued, to see if I would be alright with representing the alumni. I would be their representative and stay in the podium and say a couple of words.

Honestly I didn't expect that. I had ceded my place as magna cum laude and speech giver. They preferred about voting and I was fine with it. I didn't want to be the one to stand in front of a generation of people from which I didn't belong and pretend to speak for them.

I told Catherine how I felt the need to try and make a speech of what I would had said. I didn't. Why bother.

And here she came. Offering me that again, except I wouldn't be speaking in the name of the psych class of 2016. The best of the class... No, I would be speaking as the best from the best of every career, not just Otay, not even just Tijuana, the whole state.

Every Magna Cum Laude from every career. I would be their representative. And I said no.

"No, I think it would be a better job for somebody else." She had offered that way out, but was still surprised. Was I serious? Was I nervous. I can't remember what she said. I just remember thinking about being introduced in front of everyone. Jose Ivan Fernandez Lozano. Male.

This time I would be in front, seated, exposed.

I reconsidered and accepted. I ought to have my speech ready for today. She would send it tomorrow to Mexicali so somebody could read it and accept it. Friday I will have to register at 10 in the morning.

The call ended and I had no more reason to return to bed. I had to initiate the speech, not just start it, but finish it.

What could I say? I wrote it and it's done, sent. They'll tell me later if something needs to be changed or taken away.

My mother will use the opportunity of the dinner to meet with Norma and Jessica. Her birthday will be the next day. Has she said anything to her mother about me? Today she asked me again what was it that the endocrinologist prescribed me. This time I did answered. She thought my doctor was a woman.

"He prescribed me something to lower down my testosterone levels."

"That's what makes you grow beard and all that"

"Yeah..." I confirmed her and told her how my levels were pretty high even for a male range.

Was it my imagination or was her face weird the rest of the day? Does she know everything is starting and I am changing? Does she note something? Of course not. I haven't shaved yet. Tomorrow I will. The hairs are long and uncomfortable. My chocolate is empty and I am left with just one cookie.

I still have to print the tests I will apply to my patient. Tomorrow I'll see Rene and him. I have therapy and tests.

I will be both a patient and a psychologist in the same day.

## 2016-04-27

I had a session today. I started to feel this strange thought of not having anything else to tell. What could I talk about? I had what happened with Catherine in her house the Thursday after I took the first pills. That talk about not wanting to leave home, not knowing what to do of her education.

I feel hunger. I ate breakfast in the morning after waking up. I decided not to do the exercises. It was hard to get up. I feel no energy. I know it's a secondary effect of blocking testosterone, a lowing of energy. I did it, though, a couple of hours ago after returning from the patient.

Liliana will leave in a trip to give a workshop in her alma mater. I told her how I would go, too, next month. The day after tomorrow I have the thing about the speech and the award. Later that night I will eat dinner with my family and my godmother.

I was a little child when I used to play with Jessica. We played a lot of things. Being a child I remember crying the first couple of times not wanting to leave. I wanted to stay with them, keep playing, doing fun stuff... It was such a new feeling having fun, having someone to talk too and play. I hid in Jessica's room and didn't want to leave.

I cried, too, when my uncle and aunts would leave home after a visit. What is it with me about being abandoned? Does it come from Edgar and my grandma leaving? Did they break me? Is that why it was so hard for me to let Monica go?

I went with Rene and talked about my dosage and treatment. Of course I'm just beginning. He's the specialist, the expert. I can order the tests. Ask for my blood type and my estrogen level.

My mother knows about my medication. Does my father? Do Luis and Miguel suspect anything?

I just finished grading Luis test. He's 12 years old, the standardization here in Latinoamerica doesn't cover his age. If I grade him with the one of a 13 year old boy, he would still be in the 90th percentile. Why don't I want to give him his score? He's above average. He knows that, I know that. He's way better and smarter than the kids his age. Why does it hurt me to accept it?

Is it because he would be like me? And if he's like me, he has a reason to ask me again to give him a test. And if he's like me, I have a reason to suspect he might have this feelings of dysphoria, too.

No... no.

He wants to be like me. He admires me, I'm his big sibling.

What will happen this week? I finished with the patient for now. Almost all the tests are done. I just have to arrange the Neo and apply him the Raven.

After that it's just the integration and the results.

Next month I will travel, before that I will have my next laser session.

Today I shaved. My face looks smoother than before, I didn't need any make up. Everyone sure saw me as a man, but I felt fine. After a week of having facial hair, this was nice.

Walking back to my car, a woman sitting in her van talking with another woman saw me and told me in a excited scream: "You have such pretty hair!"

I just smiled.

I made a stop in the pharmacy. I asked the man over the counter if they were still giving the cards of discount. He told me yes, I just needed and official ID and a picture. I gave him both and he went back.

After a couple of minutes I went around and found the pill organizers. There were several different kinds and I picked one big enough for all of my treatments. He gave me the plasticized card with my picture and my name: "do you prefer Jose or Ivan?".

"This card is for personal use only. It's a company property and if someone else uses we will confiscate it."

What will happen in a couple of weeks when I stepped in there again to buy my antiandrogens and hormones? What if I look feminine or just not masculine enough?

What if being a man they tell me that I can't buy the medicines of that prescription or ask me for whom they are.

"They're for me. I'm Sofia, but my legal name is Ivan."

It might hurt a little to say that, but it would be the truth.

## 2016-04-28

It's been a long time since I've lied down here in bed over my stomach with the laptop where my pillow should be. I am used to typing these words in the other keyboard, and using the television as a monitor. It's weird hearing the music from the laptop speakers instead of hearing the whispers of it through the headphones that compress my ears.

What could I write just now? Will this be another telling of my morning routine and daily activities? I haven't filled this day's daylio notes. That little and cute app that asks me the mood of the day and the activities I did. The summary of the 750 words I write here.

I picked Catherine up. I grabbed the hamburgers, the vegan ones, from the freezer. Another one of beef, too. Again we went to the university. This time I parked in the other parking lot, the one for students. Now the vast majority of the students in my faculty are ones who got in after I did. In the morning I called the doctor over the phone and asked for an appointment for him to check my papers. We waited for him outside his office. He was the same doctor that was giving class when Catherine was doing her social service helping the lady in charge of the promotion of the school lottery. He was telling the young students how the money of their selling was for sending us psych students to study abroad. "Are you going to study abroad?" He asked her. "Yeah". "Where are you going?" "Chile". "That's really far away. Why are you going over there? Don't you want some dark skinned boy like this one over here?" He pointed towards Manuel sitting in the front row. He was dying of embarrassment while Mario and his other friend where laughing their white coats off.

He did some jokes while we were there. Catherine was the first one. While he checked her documents I saw how her CURP copies where of the both sides. Mine I took them myself and just did the front. Would he deny them? Should I start all over again another day?

No, that didn't happen. He received my papers and copies and pictures and all was set. In a month I can go again and pick the no exigibility form. Almost a year later they would call me to pick up both my license and certificate.

It's finally done. I'm done being a student. I remember being a little kid thinking of this day so much. How many years are left for me to study? Then I can work and be independent, have my own house and pay for my own things. Live by my own rules.

And here I am, working with a single patient gaining 200 pesos. On the other hand I do live by my own rules. Who else can say that they are changing their own biology to be truly themselves?

Tomorrow is the first of the many bookmarks already set in my calendar. Tomorrow I will get up early in the morning, earlier than today, and do all the things that I didn't write this time. Then I will put some fancy clothes and print that cheesy speech and go register in the university. I will wait and wait and be nervous. I might be seated in the front, I might be seated with the rest of the students. I might not even be called.

After the ceremony and my mother's reaction and several congratulations in Facebook from people who don't really give a shit, I might see Monica.

Why did I write that? I was going to delete it and correct myself. But no... I won't see her, I don't want to see her.

I will see Catherine, just like I did today. We kissed and touched each other, we whispered our love to one another. I am happy.

I might see Catherine.

Later in the night my mother and father will take me to dinner, celebrate. Jessica and Norma will be with us. Will Martin be there, too? They have seen me with my hair. I actually traveled with them to Las Vegas. How long ago was that? A year? Two? No, two years ago I was in Spain.

How was my hair, how much different did I look? I was hesitating with the idea of telling my mom.

They will see me with a suit and maybe a tie. They will see the Ivan they've always known. My mother will be the only... no, both of my parents will now the secret under the man suit.

## 2016-04-29

It's done. I was in front, for the first time, standing in the podium with a theater full of people and students and family. I spoke the words I had prepared. The rector of the university applauded me standing. The Dr besides me smiled and said it was a nice speech. Several of the people with which I shook hands congratulate me back. One of them, maybe one of the postgraduate ones told me he like my speech, too.

I have the award and the medal. I can put now in my CV that I am Scholar Merit and that have Excellency of the EGEL. I don't even need to mention now the award I received from the university in Tecate. I could frame them and put them in my consultory.

Would I do that? Mark them with that name? I am still me. But would I let people now?

That was a little saddening thought.

Catherine did go to see me speak. Both my mother and father were there, too. One of the VIP told me how they make this kind of rotation of the places. Last year it was Mexicali, and before that Ensenada, and so, and so. They really picked me from all of the graduates. Me from Tijuana and the master from Ensenada. He graduated with a perfect 100 from his master.

What could had happen if it were somewhere else?

I liked that Catherine were there. From the university we went our way. I drove her to the Alitas. We ate chicken wings and french fries. She ordered for me a glass of beer with clam juice and sauces. Her drink was almost the same but with cucumber. For dessert we shared a bailey's mikshake.

Today was the same drink that we shared yesterday in her balcony.

I was nervous as hell in the morning and at noon when I was waiting outside. Would they separate me from the rest or give it to me later in the ceremony?

After eating I brought her home with me. I changed clothes. I can't stand the suit for a long time. I put some jeans and a shirt. I see the skin from my hands paler. I know it must be mostly in my head. It's been just a week. She grabbed my breast and told me how it felt fuller.

We shared dinner, my whole family, Catherine and Jessica and Norma. They know each other. Jessica asked her if she remembered her.

Tomorrow my family wants to go to the United States. I told my dad just a couple of minutes ago how I think I will pass. Instead I'll stay and grade the tests. I have to analyze the drawings. I have to actually transcript the NEO.

"80% from our graduates find a job in their field in a year... 50% in the first six months"

I will be one of the later statistics again.

Even I with a Scholar Merit and Excellency Medal and sitting in front of the whole theater full of honored students I don't one or even an offer.

I have a job. Kind of...

It doesn't matter. I have plans for the future, I will apply to the master and I will get in and finish it with honors, too. I will do lots of great things... surely?

If I get to live my life as me, happy with my reflection and the way the world sees me, even if I don't get a big important job or this fulfilling career I will be happy.

I wish Catherine were here by my side just now. I love having her beside me, her hands stroking my back and my face. Her fingers dancing gently over my skin. Like brushes painting this calming sunset or nibs dripping with ink writing the secrets of happiness on my cheeks and lips.

I love her.

We've been talking and planning with Anahi about going to the movies. The Captain America movie is out now. We will watch it someday of the next week, probably Wednesday. Next weekend we will go to the movies with Paola.

In two weeks I have the next laser session. Two weeks after that I'll go the Jalisco. A couple of weeks later I will have to test my blood again and see how much, if any, is my testosterone getting lower. A month after that will be the Pride parade.

Will Anahi come with us this year? I'd like that, although I don't mind sharing it again with just Catherine. Maybe now they might see us as the lesbian couple we really are.

## 2016-04-30

Another month now. 18 days until I finished the two hundredth consecutive day.

Today is the tenth day of hormones. Then again I keep thinking about the dosage and feel that time is being wasted. 7 weeks from now I can see my endo and tell him my worry. I've been reading about dosages, I know the medications and its effects. I know cyproterone is more potent than spironolactone but then again the dosage is a tenth of the prescribed one.

I see myself differently, but I think the change is in my own eyes.

I'm getting sick of receiving the notifications of yesterday's pictures. Over and over I see the number getting higher and higher with the names of the people congratulating me and reacting to the images of me in a suit handshaking with a lot of people and talking in a podium.

I saw some of the pictures and I could see the receding hairline of my right side. It's scary to think that I am growing older. Jessica today turns 23 years old. I've known her for almost 20 years now. We met before my brother was born. I was 4 years old? No, I don't think so, or was I?

I might be 5 or 6. Norma was my godmother in the graduation of kindergarten. 5, then. 18 years. We shared a classroom in jr high school and went to the same high school. One of her best friends, Andres, according to what my mother knows suffers from a similar fate of mine.

His was more notable. Everyone could sense it. It was obvious. Was everyone blind to my own signs or did I hid them thoroughly?

I did today's exercise later than usual but still early. It was back and arms. My legs are still sore. My parents and brothers went to the United States, yesterday I told my dad I preferred to stay here. I didn't feel like getting up early and besides I had to interpret the tests I have.

I asked them for a burger and a weight scale. I weighted myself. I'm 81 kilograms still, 179 pounds. It's the same than half a month ago.

There was a text I had read about losing water-based weight. How when you start lose that water pounds and then gain them back when the body readjusts itself. Nonetheless, there is a fat weight loss, but it goes unnoticeable because of its smallness in comparison to the other one.

Is that it? Or is it my fluctuating diet and diminished motor activity?

I can't remember the last time I wore feminine clothes. Yesterday I wore a suit and tie.

Next week I might go to the movies with Catherine and Anahi and Luis. I promised him. I want to go, and yet I'm scared that the plans won't come through. I get nervous about the clash of my two social globes, my two personas.

What if they mix my names? What if Luis asks something? Why haven't I told him yet? What am I really waiting for?

Jessica and Chevo sent me text messages today, both of them.

First it was Catherine who gave me Jessica's salutes. "Are you with Sofia? Sent her my regards"

It felt weird reading it from her words. I don't expect her to use the name, I feel it fake. It's a little unfair. When she gets it wrong, I don't hesitate to blame her and confirm my thoughts about her difficulty with the theme, and whenever she gets them right, I discard her effort and cover her good intentions in a blankness of deceit, of fake kindness.

Chevo congratulated me, too, for my award. Why do I perceive their kindness something not to be trusted? What is it about receiving what I want that makes me so uncomfortable?

Even the thought of hearing my own name in this house makes me nauseous. I can't even imagine how it would sound coming from my parents lips, the musicality of being called by their voices. Hearing them talk about me as a real person, an existing entity.

I am real. I exist. Then why do I hide myself?

Why am I scared of being shown and found?

Am I really a woman if I still don't look like one? Will I ever look the part?

Will they ever be able to see me like one? Do the people who call me by my name really know me by it?

Do I actually see me as myself?

## 2016-05-01

I've finished making the spreadsheet for the ISRA test. I love doing this kind of things. I should had studied Computer Science or Software Developing. I mean, I love that this calculations offer me the information I need to actually make a diagnosis of the psychological profile of a subject.

My dad brought breakfast today. I did the exercise in the morning, although it was just warm up. I showered. I weighted one or two pounds less than yesterday. I had just went to the bathroom and had finished the morning activities.

What else can I write about? Catherine went to the United States and bought us two t-shirts. Chevo and Jessica posted something in the conversation of the seven of us. They wanted to invite us to go tomorrow to the movies and see the new captain america film. Catherine answered them first. We already have plans with Anahi and my brother.

He was sitting here in my room with the lights out. I was lying in the couch watching tv and saw when he went out of sight and never appeared in the hole of the wall that shows the stairs. After a while I stood and check. He was in this chair watching something in his ipad. I freaked out. I know he was not snooping around or even seeing the computer, but I snapped. "What are you doing in my room?" I asked him firmly. He smiled thinking I was just joking around because of how I don't like him sitting in the chair. After noting my voice and my face, his smile faded and he just apologized and went upstairs. Did I do something wrong?

I sometimes go to his room but never when he's not there. I don't snoop in his stuff. I sometimes go when he's not there. I am an hypocrite. My secrets are not more important than his. I wasn't thinking about this. I was just angry of people being in here.

Tomorrow I'll go to Catherine's home, maybe we'll meet Anahi there. Catherine hasn't seen the last episode of How I Met your Mother. We made her promise us we would all see it together.

We can see the first episode of the other season of Misfits. There is now ready the last episode of Game of Thrones. We will see it together.

There are other things I could write about, but, I think I feel a little down.

Yesterday I researched a little about the dosage. I found the endocrine guidelines for treatment, now I have evidence that my doses are really low. It's just the first 8 weeks. I'm not even by a fourth of that timeframe. I could just be patient and wait.

I'd be lying if I said the changes don't scare me.

A part of me wants to experiment them now, see them, feel my body different and see how my face changes little by little, being unrecognized by the people who're supposed to know me. I want to see Chevo and Jessica and look at their faces when they see me differently.

Is that why their usage of my name makes me uncomfortable? Am I really expecting of never mentioning it to my parents until people can't really see me as a man anymore?

In a month, no, the last days of this one, I will go to Mexicali and travel to Jalisco. My parents might go, too. I don't have to say anything until then. I'll still be Ivan, their son, their honored graduate.

Hilda and Anna will see me as how I am. Just a couple more weeks of low doses of hormones and another sessions of laser. That will be the only differences between me as of right now and future me.

I could ask my mother for the money of therapy. I have to put gas tomorrow. I'll drive tomorrow and Wednesday. I should buy the pills. The antidepressants. I could wait to buy the "anti-baby" pills as Johanna called them. I won't get pregnant, and besides, The endocrinologist did recommend me to leave a four day window of rest.

I feel a tingling ache in my testicle. Is it the anti-androgens making its thing?

I finished with the ISRA test. A couple more questionnaires and I'm done. I have to transcript the NEO one. I could finish with the translation and do a google form. Would I need permission to actually make the standarization?

I could ask Chevo for help. I could do it all by myself. It's just a side work. I won't make any money. I could contact the spanish doctor and tell him my plan of adapting it to the Mexico population. I won't lose anything by asking.

I could keep procrastinating. That is always an option.

## 2016-05-02

Honestly, I don't feel like writing. It's been more than 180 continuing days that I've finished this thing of writing my thoughts unedited, just let out what I feel and think for a couple of minutes in semi-coherent sentences that I probably won't read again.

Why? Experts claim that an habit needs at least 21 days for it to be conformed. I haven't been doing exercise for more than 21 days. There was one day that I skipped. I still wrestle with the idea of just skipping it today, stay in bed, sleep a little more.

I can hear Luis talking about his results of the RAVEN test I gave him. Why does it bother me? Sure, he might be smarter than me when I was his age, so what? He might end up being smarter than me when he gets to my age. Miguel is studying an engineering major, he studied a technical speciality in high school, and yet he did exams, I skipped all of them. I graduated as the 12th of my generation.

From undergrad I finished as first of my generation. I have a medal for it and a diploma. I sat in the table of vip and shook hands with the other winners. I gave a speech. I will travel to another state to receive a medal for the score I had in my professional test.

Should I be proud? Do I feel threatened by the idea that Luis could be smarter than me?

The day after tomorrow I'll pick him up from school. We'll meet with Catherine in River Plaza and later with Anahi to watch the movie. I'll drive to his school after my session with Rene. My mother will give notice to his school that "his brother" will pick him up.

They don't know me anymore. His is not the same school that I attended to, not anymore.

There are a lot of movies that I haven't seen yet. There are a lot of books that I haven't read. I still haven't learned calculus or programming.

Did I give up? Will I give up the exercise, too?

I remember when I weighted myself almost every day. Is this nervousness about getting over the scale and seeing a bigger number than the one from the day before. I do my exercise, I try to control what I eat, but what if it isn't enough?

Today I showered and shaved. I shaved my whole body. There are red dots on my thighs that have not closed still. One on the left one stayed open and dripping until well after I had finished with my face. There lies a big red mark on the yellow towel which I used to dry myself with.

I ate breakfast, I scrambled two eggs with the sauce that my mother left from yesterday. With that and a glass of water I took my pills. Those pills. How ironic that a little more than nothing feels more useless than waiting to start. I am taking one pill each, a fourth, of what I should be taking is still more than nothing. Why does it feel so vain?

I started treatment, I am doing something. The lady from the gas station welcomed me as a woman. Why does it still feel fake and undeserving? Maybe I will always feel this way. Maybe I'll stay like this until I start seeing myself differently.

Yesterday I read some chapters of the book. I don't think I'll finish it soon, but I still read more than what I had the last month.

In 8 weeks I have the next appointment with the endocrinologist. I read how one patient started with 25 mg of spiro for a month. I'll just be 4 weeks longer. I have the paper, I have the evidence to ask for a higher dose. I don't even know the effects the medication has had on me.

In 8 weeks I'll have finished the program that my app gave me for losing weight. Will the dr weight me again, too? Will he check my body like that time? Will he ask about my breasts again? Are they even breasts?

In two weeks, no, less than that. In ten days I will have my next laser session. I hope it hurts. I hope it's more effective than last.

Should I tell the woman the medication I am taking? What if she says something or asks more questions?

My mother knows about them, but I don't know about my dad.

Should I tell Luis? It's idiotic to think about waiting until he asks.

Will I tell him?

## 2016-05-03

It was hard to get up form bed. Again I slipped my hand into my trousers, inside my pants and grabbed, touched, explored. I though I would have to reinitiate the counter on my app where I crudely tagged it "Days since I cum". The number is still the same.

I ate the biscuit breakfast and took the pills. Those little candies that its function is make me smile. Some kill my tears and fears, others destroy the manliness that poisons my body and the other one changes me from the inside. 5 little pills.

Thursday will be 12 of May, a little more than a week. That day I'll have the second session. I remember typing this exact words: "I hope it hurts".

That day Luis will have his recital or festival or something. My mother asked me if I wanted to come. Sure, I told her. That day will be Thursday. This week I'll have the penultimate session of testing with the patient. But even if for some reason I could finish this Thursday, the next one would be for results.

It's weird. I was afraid of being alone. Having no friends or supporting people. All of my group of friends know everything about me. Ok, maybe not the hormones, but everything else. The use the name and the pronouns. It's even with Catherine or where they're not actually required to.

Why do I keep wishing that they weren't here? Why do I still want to be alone? I don't want anybody to know I am trans. I don't want them to see me and see a quimera, nor a metamorphosis. I want to be me. I want to be seen as me.

But who really am I? Am I Ivan or Sofia? I don't want to be referred by the male name and forms. Why does it is still uncomfortable to give the Sofia's prescription? Or entering to the lab?

Why is it impossible to tell my parents about my name and persona?

Tomorrow I'll pick Luis from school. I'll walk to therapy as usual and pick him up from there. Everything else will be different. We'll drive to River plaza and meet with Catherine, maybe Anahi will meet us there, too.

What will happen in his school? My mother already gave notice that his big brother would pick him up. How will I dress?

I know exactly what I will wear. What I don't and can't know is how will I look.

Will I clear my face? Will I retouch it? Will there be somebody to recognize me? Will Luis say something?

Today was the burial of Eneyda, the medicine student who was missing and then found dead. I had known about her, seen the posts and news. I knew how she studied in the faculty. What I ignored was how she was Fernando's girlfriend. He's mourning. Anahi saw him in the funeral. She told us how she was expecting to see him crying, or devastated. He was just, there. missing, with the empty sight of a broken man. He was empty.

I can't even imagine how it would be the experience Catherine's lost.

I can write and wonder how it would be to be alone or isolated and forgotten. But even then, it's like I take Catherine as granted. Of course she would be by my side if I went to a hidden place of the world where nobody knows my story.

What if it were the other way around? What would be if everyone stayed but her?

If I had known about the app months ago, the first used I would had thunk about using it for would be counting the days since my last reaching out to Monica.

Lately, I really didn't know since when had I thunk about her or her face?

It came as a surprise when Catherine mentioned her. Yesterday instagram offered her one of her pictures and her accouns as being similar to her tastes. Today, the same photo appeared on her screen. She told me how she had seen this girl with Monica. At first I thought the coincidence was that the account that instagram offered her was of this woman with her picture with Monica.

The account was Monica. I didn't care. I didn't want to know. There was no surprise or interest. She kept on and I realized it was not apathy but worry what ill-ed me.

"Show me the picture' I thought of asking.

She kept talking about it and just send it anyway. She wanted to show the text that the app gave her. But I could see the silhouettes of the two women in dresses. A normal curvy body wrapped in a light striped gray dress, and a slimmer firm one with a black dress and the hint of red strappy shoes.

I recognized the body and hated it and missed it and envied it.

There was no face, just a body.

Later in the day I looked for the picture and met her face. Her smiling, mocking face.

Does she think of me, does she hate me?

Will I stop some day remembering her?

## 2016-05-04

I'm home. My phone was dead. As I grabbed it from my purse, I could see a red light flashing on the microphone. It vibrated a couple of times through the bag. Luis was seating by my right and Catherine by my left.

"Do I call her Sofia?" "No...?" "But, calling her Ivan will upset her"

I do hate being in this situation.

I woke up and drove to pick Luis up from school like three or for times before leaving my bed. Today I got up earlier than usual. Several times did I awoke and return to slumber before deciding to start the day. By 8 o clock I was already doing the morning exercises. Abs. Something about crossing the legs or hips and 40 seconds of planking. As I weighted myself I didn't realize I had actually gained a pound instead of losing it.

I shaved and put clothes on. I wore the shirt that Catherine bought for us. I decided to wear the long black sweater. I applied make up even though I would be picking Luis up. There was a kid there, reading a book, when I entered the office. Rosa welcomed me and congratulate me about my graduation and being now a psych licenciate. The boy asked me why was I picking Luis up if he leaves in the afternoon. He started chatting about the book he was reading. Frankenstein from Mary Shelly, I read that book when I was in fifth grade I guess. It was one of the first books in english that I read. I don't remember most of the story.

I picked Luis up and listened to him, what he had to say. He was confused why it was talking about Victor Frankenstein and he was telling the story but in the cover it said Mary Shelly. I explained to him how it was a story written by Mary and Victor was the protagonist. He seemed to understand my point a little.

I drove towards the plaza with Luis. I told Rene I would be taking him to the movies. We talked a little about last week. The card of the pharmacy and the problems I might face in the future. Eneyda, the student who was murdered. A med student from the faculty, the girlfriend of Fernando, Anahi's friend. It stuns you, when things happen closer than you might expect.

Catherine was with Andrea when we arrived. I introduced them as we walked. We went to the food garden, and after giving a round seeing the different locals, Luis and I decided to order two bowls of ramen. It was the newest place there and the first one we visited. "Welcome (girls)," the cashier received Catherine and me, with Luis behind me. Did he hear?

"What happens when you have both high levels of hormones in your body, male and female ones?"

I explained to him a little how testosterone is stronger and would overcome the estrogen. Does he know something? Is it because of me or him?

Should I let my pills out on the open for him to see? Should I just come to him and open up?

I reapplied my make up before picking him up.

And just like therapy, I don't know what else I can say. There were some messages planning a meeting, a going out with the gang. Paolas, chevica and us. I am a little excited about going, seeing them. How would they look at me? Could I go like me?

Catherine took the screenshot of the picture I sent her. I saw the video she took of me as I was eating soup. I could see me, my face, my eyes, my hair. I heard my voice. What is it? It's low, not really manly, but not feminine either. It is a male voice, unmistakeable. Can I change it, modulate it?

I wouldn't use female pronouns besides Luis, would I raise my voice?

I stood beside him with a bra and make up and a long sweater. Some feminine nouns slipped Catherine's mouth. I'm sure Luis heard them as he heard the ramen cashier.

Maybe this weekend we will go to Mexicali. I could go, I don't mind. When my mother asked us, I didn't tell her I had plans for this saturday. They asked about Sunday. We could go just that day.

I would not enter the pool. I would not take my shirt off.

Would I show them my pills? Would anyone ask? Would I answer?



## 2016-05-05

Another day of applying tests. I'm done with the tedious part of giving questionnaires and waiting. Next week I'll attend the session about the results.

Catherine talked with her mother. She was asked about me. They talked about Eneyda, the student that was killed. And so came the subject. The students of psychology are the ones who take psychotherapy, not the med ones.

"And talking about therapy... how is Ivan?"

And how am I indeed. I am fine, now. Catherine used the opportunity to bring her mother up to the latest news. Both of my parents know, I will "make the change", our relationship is serious, she is scared of what her dad could think or say, and that's the reason why she is not really able to visualize a future with me. Even if I change, she'll stay by my side.

I read the questions. I did not hear her voice or inflection or could see her eyes as she laid them in the air. Even then I felt, uh, rejection.

She doesn't really accept the relationship. Once again, people wish she could be with somebody else. Am I damaged goods?

She told me how she feels about her mother's illness. She's been sick lately, vomit and nausea and high blood pressure and how it is stress and stuff... Is it us? our relationship what's making her feel this way?

She wants grandchildren and talk about her daughter and her life and a big wedding... and with me, those things won't happen. I am the one who's taking that from her hands.

"She doesn't want them for me, she wants those for herself"

This day I finished the format of the questionnaire and I'm glad I did. I calculated a 45 minutes of answering each of them. He made the first one in 25 minutes. His score is lower than Luis. The second one he finished it before the hour came up. Liliana told me how she's thinking about sending me another evaluation.

And my mother now told me about the reaction of her friend, my godmother, Theresa. She saw the video of my speech, how I talked and congratulated them. She cried of the excitement.

Can I take those accomplishments as mine? Are they still my own if I go by another name or face?

How could I brag my diplomas and medals when they were awarded to another person? Will everyone still congratulate me when they won't recognize me anymore? Will they still remember about what I have accomplished when they don't care about me?

I weighted myself in the morning and returned to the number of two days ago. I fried the meat of one taco with two eggs. The plate lasted me almost half of a show. I used to finished it before the first commercial break would even start.

I waited until the afternoon before eating again. One burrito and the chicken Miguel left yesterday.

I dreamed something about someone taking out my clothes from the drying machine. It was loaded with my underwear and pajama bottoms. A couple of shorts and a couple of pants, besides that they were just colorful panties and three bras. Months ago I wouldn't even had let them in the machine. I remembered them before falling asleep, I just didn't care.

In my dream there was a conversation, doubt and shock. And I just didn't care. I heard it and I could explain it, and felt this feeling inside of me of being relieved. I rested with the comfort of a lightness.

I woke up and went to pick them up. They were in a cardboard box in front of the machine. The clothes were Miguel's. He was the one who took them out and laid them in there. He absolutely knows something by now. Does he care? Will he mention it?

Do I care?

I received a call today from the laser place. They will have this promotion, I assume for the mother's day, that they will offer every service by half of it's price. I could pay two sessions, just pay the one of next week and another one and receive four.

I have from tomorrow until Tuesday.

In the weekend we will go to Mexicali. Saturday I might see the gang. They talked about going somewhere fun and where they'd serve food, too. Someone proposed Pockets. I feel a little excited. What can I wear? How will I present myself?

Now that they know, there is this pressure of using it, not wasting their knowledge and acceptance. Like if I should force myself to show me.

Just like going to the endo, or taking my blood as Sofia.

Do they really see me like that?

Or are we all just kidding myself?

## 2016-05-06

I have already finished grading the Raven test. It was annoying looking again for a norm. It was the opposite this time. With Luis I wanted to give him a lower score so he wouldn't brag later of his abnormal intelligence. With my patient, even yesterday that I gave the test to him, I was surprised with the time he finished. He was done in less than a half an hour. Luis lasted almost the hour. The patient, even with two years more of age than Luis, got a score of 7 points below. His discordance points, both of them, were in the correct range. He barely got into the 50th percentile. He's barely average.

I have the raw score of the IPIP NEO 300. The complete 300 answers to the items are recorded in 10 sheets of paper. I could just transcript the numbers to the excel tables and get the raw scores of each facet and subscale.

But those numbers don't say much if I don't compare them with something else, with a sampling, with the rest of people. And like the rest of the tests I got into research mode and looked everywhere for a table of norms. There is none anywhere. Even the page where I looked for the Scales says how they don't recommend analyzing a single test. There should be a sample and an analysis of a group, with each member contrasted with the rest of that sample.

So, I'm screwed. I could trust the raw data of other researchers. I finally found the answers of more than 300 thousand people. The only problem is the data is raw. It's a piece of text with all the answers separated by spaces. How could I analyze that? It's moments like these that make me think that I haven't learned enough. That I don't know enough.

Yesterday my mother told me how her psych friend reassured her that she lasted two years to be accepted in a job because of the lack of experience. After hearing how the psychologists refers patients for me to be evaluated, she told her that that is awesome and enough. It's perfect for declaring experience.

Why don't I feel comforted, then?

Tomorrow I'll go out. I'll shave and change clothes. We will be meeting near the River zone an hour after noon.

Catherine told how she would be arriving later. Her mother finishes her english class by one and she has to do her cleaning and change of bandages.

Do I prefer leaving by myself and getting there on time? Or wait for Catherine and arrive with her?

It still makes me feel nervous exiting the house dressed in a feminine way. Walking alone and face strangers. Speak and be heard. The contrast of my voice and presentation.

Her mother has seen changes. Luis keeps asking about gender and transexual people and hormones. Miguel took my underwear out of the drying machine.

It's been two weeks of hormones. A low dose but two weeks.

This weekend I have to change money, buy dollars so I can go and pay the laser sessions. Next thursday I'll go for the second one.

In three weeks I have to be in Mexicali and ready to board a plane. Get my clothes to the cleaning place. Buy the medicine.

I can give a lot of use to the new app I downloaded that gives me points in an rpg way for the things that I have to do.

All the tests, all but one, are interpreted and ready. There is just the integration and redaction of the report. Liliana will give my phone number to the next patient to be evaluated, a teacher. Woman, adult.

I'm more comfortable with adult people. I don't feel like I have to take care of them. I don't feel like I have to hide information or juggle the confidentiality.

What I find I tell her. I'm paid by her. The results are to her.

Another person that will meet me as the Psychologist Ivan.

"The diploma will say Licensed Psychologist Jose Ivan Fernandez"

That's who I will be. Who I was supposed to be. How will I pick the diploma a year from now with my id? What will they tell me? It's still a year. I have lots of things to worry before that. 10 months. 8 months by a bigger dosage of hormones. Maybe I will still be able to look like Ivan. Even for a couple of minutes.

Do I hope for it or not?

## 2016-05-07

I haven't filled the agenda. It lies there, unopened with the answered tests of my patient over it. Today I left the house, I wore the same clothes I always use, but presented in a completely different way. I didn't wear a bright red lipstick or an intense eyeliner. I didn't wear a really feminine blouse or filled my bra with anything.

I just wore what I liked and touched up my face. My hair is mine, natural, nothing but conditioner and mousse on it. Cheap foundation and a mascara from target. That was it. That was all I wore.

My parents went to Costco in the morning after my dad left the bathroom and I got in. I didn't eat breakfast and took my pills anyway. In the morning I did the exercises, they were focused on the arms. Yesterday I didn't overeat. In Pockets I realized hoy it's more conscious now the intention of eating slower. It helps with the appetite and lower to food I intake.

I weighted myself after shitting in the bathroom from downstairs. I weight 175 pounds, one less than yesterday. 5 less than when I started weighting myself. There is progress. As I looked at myself in the mirror of the bathroom before entering the shower I realized how I am changing.

There was no conditioner bottle so I turned the water valves, wrapped myself in the towel and called my dad for another bottle. He gave it to me and I returned to what I was doing.

Catherine was waiting for her parents to arrive. Whenever they did, I could leave my house and go pick her up. Her mother would just clean her bandages and she'd be ready. We were the ones supposed to get there late, but were the first ones.

Paola was the next one to arrive. We chatted through the windows of the cars. Like 20 minutes later Chevo and Jessica came to the parking lot. They had to return home because they forgot something. After meeting, they'd go to a concert of Sin Bandera.

How did I look? That was in my head. The waiter kept calling Chevo "joven". Later he would give him the check. We played and took pictures. It was fun.

After playing pool while we waited for the food, we decided to go outside and wait in the patio.

Jessica invited us for her birthday to go somewhere and do something. Both Catherine and I thought about a night outside, a couple of bars, some drinks. It sounded nice. Then she completed herself. "Maybe breakfast? something nice"

She wanted to go to this place. "It was my idea", interrupted her Chevo jokingly.

"Princess tea party restaurant" I remember that place. Next saturday. I saw pictures of people in there. Pink wallpapers, everything fancy and nice. We would go there and eat breakfast. How would they see me? How would I look there? I remember seeing the pictures and hating the place. All the gender expectations and reinforcements.

I wouldn't be there as a man. Why am I still uncomfortable?

It will be two days after my laser session. The next day, friday, I won't be able to shave. The hairs are thicker and blacker. When I shave the next day, would they still be noticeable?

I am a little nervous, a little stressed.

After we all leave the place and said our good-byes, I invited Catherine to a cup of coffee. We drank tea in the Dinastia 12. It was nice. We were welcomed in the feminine way when we entered. As we sat, the waitress looked at us and asked us if we were ready in the feminine way, too.

It was a contrast of being in Pockets with people who know me. Waiters who don't and strangers who look at me with evaluating and suspecting eyes.

"La graduacion de ellos, invitarlos a mi casa, juntos"

All the plurals were in the masculine, neutral. The singular ones were omitted or avoided. A couple of times, one by Chevo and the last one, by Jessica when she told us to go pretties to the tea place.

There is the house of tea that I haven't took Catherine there yet.

Outside Catherine's house, we kept our conversations. We finished with how we would live together in the capital. Her mother asked her about me, our relationship. The wedding, would she confess? Am I one of her sins?

Are we ready to live together?

She's a little nervous and I am very excited.

## 2016-05-08

Two days before my father's birthday and mother's day.

I have placed almost all the pills for next week. Today I woke up before my father arrived from his morning trip.

I was younger. It was before highschool. How is it that I used to write this...

I am not her, I am not 22. I haven't entered high school yet. I am 15 years old. There is this girl I like, she's my closest friend but I have mixed feelings about her. There is a connection that's not really physical. I like being with her and close with her. I don't really feel the urge to hug her or feel her or kiss her. I haven't kissed anyone ever.

She asked me to be one of her "chambelanes". I've always hated this mexican tradition of the 15th brithday party of girls. It's not envy. They make me uncomfortable, it's facing the fact that they're different. She invited to be on hers and I feel special because of it. I am important enough to share this moment. I'm here in her gym for the essays of her dance. I've met her father. "don't you think it's normal that the man of the family has some time for himself?, doesn't your dad goes sometimes somewhere himself, like fishing or something"

Even those questions, it wasn't about me and yet it was so foreign.

Why am I writing about that moment? There are a lot other things I could be thinking about. Even then, the party, wearing the suit and getting uncomfortable, leaving early, taking it off. I played a character earlier that same day and I played another one, both with Zuri's friends, with my own, in the dance floor. I was extremely tired.

I did the exercise, weighted myself, took the pills and ate.

I watched the game of thrones episode without Catherine. There was the fight outside Tower of Joy. Rickon was given to Ramsey. Jon has left his watch.

Tomorrow I'll go pay the next sessions of laser and I'll buy both the cypro and the spiro, even though I won't take them until next week. How will the effects of its absence bother me? I've been complaining and whining about the low dose. If it's so low, not taking them wouldn't have to take a huge effect on me.

Tomorrow is 9. In three weeks exactly I'll be going to Mexicali, flying.

The first time I boarded a plane was before Miguel was born. My grandmother was sick and I traveled to Mexico City. I had faint memories about walking and climbing huge heads. I'm in this kind of park like disneyland but different. I pose in this huge board with ta cowboy riding a horse painted in the front, there is this hole on the wood where my face can appear over the cowboy's body. I ride this game where I drive an excavating machine. I'm fours year old, three maybe. How can I remember this? It was almost 20 years ago. Like another different life.

I was a boy then.

"Excuse me, are you a boy or a girl?" "... a boy" "see? I told you" Were they teasing me? How could they not know?

Then, a couple years later I would travel to Jalisco for vacations. I was in second grade. Miguel was just a baby, and I was a little kid. For years I would have this urges to fly again, somewhere, anywhere. I wanted to travel, go through the airport, board the plane, fly...

I am in the university, it's a little after my birthday and I'm doing all the paperwork to fulfill my dream. In my head I am battling my own war. I travel alone. Four flights. First to Jalisco, again, and then Monterrey. The same way back. After years I board four different airplanes in a weekend's length.

I would fear it was all for naught even until the day before I actually left. It was a transatlantic flight. I took an american airplane and went through an american airport all by myself. From California to London. Then Madrid.

I flight another time before returning. From Madrid to Brussels. A lot of bus and train travels I've done, too.

Even after traveling around Spain and meeting the world, I traveled again with Catherine to Jalisco one more time. One week there. Those were some of the happiest days I've ever had. I had the opportunity to compare traveling by myself with traveling along someone I love.

While I be alone in this month's travel, too?

Will I travel again next year to Mexico city again? Will I be alone or along my loved one?

## 2016-05-09

For the first time I'll write here in my phone. There has been more than a handful of times that I published my words from here. But it's always about an emergency, maybe I'm in mexicali,or I'm in Disneyland and there is no Internet. How did I do it when we went to Universal studios?

Those times I just copy and paste. This, now that there is no Internet home and won't be until tomorrow, is the first time that I've actually tried to write them in a different keyboard.

Today I went to pay for the laser session. The lady in the spa recognized me. Maybe I'm young, maybe she doesn't get much male clientele.

First I changed 600 pesos to dollars. I paid one hundred for four sessions. I'm set until September. Four months counting this one.

I went to the pharmacy and they welcomed me with a "young man" they said nothing about the discrepancy between the names in the prescriptions. I bought both the antidepressants, spironolactone and the antibaby pills.

From there I went to Catherine's.

We talked and watched the episode of game of thrones. Her mother made chicken in Chipotle sauce. I was supposed to like it. It should had been delicious, except it wasn't. There was a heavy taste of cream in it. I just ate the chicken and the rice.

What could I wear for Saturday's. Jessica's breakfast will be in a fancy and feminine restaurant. At first, I was apathetic to the idea. But now...

I don't really want to go with pants and shirt. I don't want to be there as a man. I am not one. On the other hand I can't be as feminine as them. I'd just feel as a caricature. Somebody hidden in a disguise.

I thought about asking her to borrow her some clothes. Maybe a blouse, something simple. I don't have shoes but our sizes are similar. Her feet are a little shorter than mine.

As we talked she told me something: you need to buy a lot more things to pass as a girl.

It broke me. I just paid more than 2 thousand pesos, today in matters related to passing. These months the medication is just a formality, they're doing nothing yet. The first laser session was a beggining. I'm thousand more behind seeing real results. And the, I need to pay more.

She didn't realize then the effect those words had on me. She sent a message to the group asking for how they would dress. Was it formal? Was it like those places were they don't allow you to enter with the wrong kind of shoes?

I read their answers and felt worse. Going pretty, like princesses. Paola send pictures of women dressed in different outfits.

I read them and felt foreign. There was no envy or longing. I just, didn't sympathize. Am I different?

I'm not like them, I'm not like Chevo either. Who, what am I?

I felt this sickening feeling in my gut. I wanted to go home, hide in my sheets and just cry.

I felt sad, so sad it hurt. I wanted to swallow it and keep it then until tonight. Catherine saw me and asked me if I was fine. I tried to lie but couldn't. My eyes betrayed me. I just let it out and hugged her. I cried in her shoulder and she held me.

It came to me as a surprise. Am I this emotional now? Are this because of the hormones? How many days have I taken them?

I'm a couple of days before beginning the rest. Four days of not taking them.

Eighteen days. A little short of three weeks. Do I have changes yet? I thought about restarting the streak when I would begin. I could use this words as a daily log of changes and new feelings. It could be a place to see the discoveries of my new body, my new self.

I didn't. I just kept on.

I like it better this way. I don't want to be defined by them. I don't want to just think about them and counting one and every day. When I wanted to know how many days have passed and I couldn't I felt relieved.

What can I do? I came to the conclusion of not going. Teling Jessica that it was too much for me. Being in a place where there would be such a focus on feminity would made me feel dysphoric. Like I don't belong. I would not feel like a man nor a woman. I would be sad and distracted and as much as I want to share the moment with you, being there, besides not really being able to accompany you, I would make things worse for everybody.

But is that what I really want? Just avoiding it and not going because I'm not woman enough?

 I might have to cheat again. I'm on my mother's phone. I dont think I have the time to type the seven hundred words now, in here.

There is still no internet. Today we went to fridays to celebrate my fathers birthday and mothers day. My mom stayed home all day. I tried to do the report but I still havent started it. I finished with the family test. I just have one more day to finish it.

Tomorrow ill go to therapy. In the evening ill see catherine after my session. I still feel sad. Its not just the saturdays breakfast place. Its not just that i have nothing to wear. Its the feeling of being an impostor, being fake, a failure.

My mother went to pick my grandma from the bus central before picking Luis up from school. Will she see me tomorrow when ill leave?

Jessica sent a message saying that shell change the place for the weekend. There was a problem today with the reservation. My problem is supposed to be solved. And yet i still feel like shit. Evertything has changed and et nothing has.

I cant keep typing on this fucking phone. I really tried. Its useless.

Fuck this. Fuck this. Fuck this...
Even cheating in this ducking phone is pissing me off.
Fucking autocorrector doesnt change i, but it does change fucking.
Fuck this.


## 2016-05-11

So close, so fucking close.

Today, after three days I got the internet back. Yesterday I really tried to finish the words from my mother's phone, I kept writing even though I was irritated and sad and wanted to do nothing. It was all for naught. one hundred and more than ninety days all gone to shit. It was the longest streak I've ever had and more than I could ever imagine.

"Do you want me to help you cheat?" she asked me. If I had told her yes. If only I could had answered her yes.

It's over. It's fine. This will be a new beginning. I have 21 days of hormones, three weeks and I'll start from zer0 here again. I'll be a shitty egg until 100 days from now that I get back the phoenix medal.

Three weeks. How many weeks until I get to female range hormone levels? Will I start over again from there?

My breasts are bigger. It might be the hormones or it might be the exercise. But I can see a difference. I dreamed something about clothes. I had thunk about wearing the black skirt with the white blouse. I've never worn the red tights I bought before the night of the movies. Today we could give a round to the shoe places in the Plaza. Maybe I could find a pair of flats there. I decided not to go.

My grandmother came yesterday, my mom picked her up from the bus station. She slept here with Luis and was up in the morning talking with my mom before she left for school. I was awake listening to their voices and screams. I wanted to go back to sleep, I was tired and angry.

I slept a couple hours more. I had time enough to shave and get ready. I decided to wear the jeans Catherine gave me and the red shirt with squares, it was a neutral attire. Nothing too masculine, but not too feminine either. I applied make up and mousse on my hair. I was ready to leave and pick Catherine up. My grandmother wasn't in the lower plant. She didn't see me.

"I can't see myself opening up to her. I was her first grandson"

I put gasoline and was dispatched by a man. He said hi normally, and then referred to me as boss. He saw me as a man. I thought that was how I looked. Sure, I could be a man another day.

I picked Catherine up from her house, her lips were a pinkly dark red. She was wearing a white t-shirt of wonderwoman. "Are you ok, you look serious?"

I was sad and down and blue.

"Ironically isn't it that you are like a princess?" said Rene after session. I am bothered by the idea of jessica's choice of restaurant, the femininity taken to the extreme. "A place for girls to feel like the princesses they are and their loved ones to treat them that way". Isn't that what I secretly want? For my family to accept it and see me and treat me as a woman?

Is not that why I can't even imagine it? Because if I think about it, I'll want it. If I know it's possible, I'll be devastated when it never comes true.

The internet finally came back and I lost my streak. I had asked her how I looked. Was it before or after the session? Kind of... in the middle, neither her nor there.

She told me how she relates me wearing shirts with being a man, maybe it's that association that makes her see me this way. Although, when I exited from Rene, I did look like a girl.

"Girls, I want to give you a good service but it was full downstairs and I'm alone"

We weren't sure if we heard her correctly. Did she call us girls? Did she see me as a woman?

Later she would say it again and we confirmed it. I did look feminine. We talked a lot about different things. I smoked like I hadn't in a long time. I'm supposed not to. I made the new timer in my phone.

I cried a little when we continued the conversation about birthdays outside her house. The time after our trips. December, January. She was supposed to get her distance from me. I invited her out. She took me out for my birthday.

"I get sad... I already was Sofi but I pretended to be Ivan, and I almost lost myself and I almost lost you"

The man who sold bread called me a girl, too, when I waited to be attended in the tire shop for the tire that wasn't really a flat.

Tomorrow I'll have my second laser session, and my second picking up of Luis and my second giving of results.

I, again, haven't finished the report for tomorrow.

## 2016-05-12

I'm a little tired. My face is neither swollen nor sore. I'm fine. I gave my second patient his results. I could see his reaction of how it was on -point. Even outside school after graduation, I feel lost without a guide. I can't give therapy.

Today I ate breakfast, I finished the chicken salad from Costco, first as a sandwich and then the rest with some crackers. That was my food of the day. That's what I ate before and after picking up Luis.

I want to go to bed and lie there. It looks so cozy and comfortable.

Luis would get out 30 minutes after noon. My appointment was at noon. I left home a quarter of an hour before. Maybe 20 minutes. I got there earlier and rang the bell. She welcomed me and I came in. She gave me the pages to sign and we came in. It hurt again, it was just like last time. The number was lower than before, does it mean that the settings were lower? It did hurt the same places. My lower neck was almost painless. Every prick or burn was both painful and exquisite. I could feel the effect. She told me how I would see patches of hairs not coming back, that would be the effects coming. I already saw some of that. I don't have to worry about beard shadow anymore.

Now the only thing bringing me back is my own voice. What's the point of looking like a woman if I can't speak?

I exited like five minutes after noon. It was the perfect time, I got to Luis' school just in time. The girl who was naming them on the mic didn't know me. She came closer to the car expecting a name. I gave it to her, full name. She didn't need it. Luis from 6th grade. That was all she said.

No, that wasn't.

"Luis of 6th, Sofia"

Those were her words.

"How would I be called if I were a girl?... How would you had named me?"

Catherine is right, I asked that same question. Except it wasn't. What changed? Why did it make me so uncomfortable? I was lying on the couch listening to the television when he opened his mouth. Was it the answers? Or their non caring? Is it that I'm scared Luis is exactly like me? So what if he is? What would it change? Why am I feeling like crying just now?

I know it's not my fault and it's not my parents.

I am trans. I wore a dress yesterday and took a picture to show it to Catherine. Miguel has a pillowcase filled with panties in his sock drawer. Luis told everyone how it would be cool if he were a girl.

I remember a chat Eric had with my grandma. He had some of his first seizures in this house. Even before that, he had some episodes, too. He got lost once when we were playing monopoly. He hid under the table. We could not find him. He stayed with my grandma and they were talking in the dinner room. Why did I listen? Why do I still remember?

"Remember how you told me you wanted to die, and you thought you would have been happier were you born a girl"

Did that conversation really happen?

Today is 12th of may. A little more than two weeks and I'll be boarding a plane again. Why ain't I excited? Was it the company that thrilled me? It's not the same if nobody who really knows me goes with me.

I was supposed to take Luis and my grandma to the university. Liliana sent me a text message a little after three. She had an urgent evaluation that she could give to me, I just needed to go earlier. It was impossible.

It was totally possible. I didn't even need to drive them. My mother got here just in time.

I could offer Hiram's parents my service as an academic supporter. Give him some assistance in his classes, tutorship. They could talk about it. I have a visa. Even I could just go there a couple days a week.

It sounded so... distant and scary. I couldn't. Not because I'm not able, or even because they would take my visa from me. I can't because I'll change. He will start the next grade after summer. I'll look totally different in August. Will I? Will I really?

Today was my first day without hormones. Three more days. Just three more.

I feel so tired.

## 2016-05-13

I feel down. There is this heavy sadness that surrounds me and embraces me. I feel so little and fragile and weak. Every single blow of wind can break me. This is the second day with just three pills. Can that be a real reason for this? Maybe this is all in my head, too. I told Catherine how I woke up really late and unrested. O feel drowsy and tired. Could I send the dr a message? He told me that I could and should text him with any symptom that presented as an effect of the medication.

Does this count?

It's a real low dose. I'm barely taking something away from my body.

I did just half of the exercise of today. It was supposed to be a morning routine and yet I skipped it completely when I got up. I ate breakfast. I didn't went to the bathroom nor weighted myself.

Catherine was. She went to the doctor in the morning. She is heavier than before.

My phone just moved with the muted dance of its vibrations of a new message. I know it's Catherine. The last message was almost an hour ago. We were talking about tomorrow, clothes. That could be another reason of my depressed mood.

I took the clothes out of the drying machine and laid it in my bed in the afternoon.

When was it that I watched the Sicario movie? Yesterday? the day before? I've put the Wolf of wallstreet like three time today. It's a movie that I've actually watched before, although incompletely. I watched it with Raul in our living room, in his laptop. His little netbook. Was it in spanish?

What can I wear tomorrow? My dad was in the kitchen as I was texting Catherine. Go to him or not? Asking him? I could tell him that I'll go out tomorrow and to move the cars. He'd ask me the time of my departure. That I don't know, not yet.

I decided against it. I want to go but not at the same time. What is it that I avoid? I told Catherine that I wanted to wear leggings but I don't have something to wear on top. My white blouse don't go with them as it is too short.

"Wear jeans". That's it, I don't want to. Why don't I? Because I wear them every fucking day. Those are my everyday clothes. I am seen as a man with them. They're woman's. I am not actually seen as a man with them. The last time I wore them, when I went out with her, everyone gendered me female. Even after I returned home when I went to the tire place.

She told me about her blouse. She feels uncomfortable lending it to me. She said something outside her house, everyone has seen it in her. It would be weird. It was so uncomfortable for me to ask her it was actually a little painful to hear her words after. Today she told me something else. Her mother doesn't like it. She feels guilty doing something behind her back. What if they take a picture and post in on Facebook and she sees it?

Why did that hurt even more?

I didn't even want it anymore. She could lend me her shoes, she told me to wear leggings and a sweater. But I don't want to wear that either. They're men's. My shoulders look wide. I look broad. They're male clothes. It's the same fucking thing. And again I'm nowhere. I don't have clothes. There's no point in buying if I can't really wear them.

They answered my mail from the university. The don't have the information of the plane ticket and hotel, but they will take me to Mexicali. Anna told me that she asked if we had to go formally, too. They told her no. Just take a black pair of formal trousers and they'd give us a shirt.

I don't have to wear a suit. I can buy a pair of trouser that actually fit. Be comfortable. Tomorrow I don't want to go shopping. I can't. Sunday. What difference does it make? It's not trousers that I need.

I saw the target page looking for female pants. It was a bad idea. There I remember the words I had told Catherine. Going to pride, she imagined us walking and me wearing a white dress. We could do it this year.

I can't buy them. I don't even have the money.

My body hasn't even started changing. I still have the dark, bold hairs of yesterday's laser session.

I'm worrying about what I will wear tomorrow and deep down I well know that they'll see me the same anyway.

## 2016-05-14

Today is Xennia's birthday. She was the first girl I liked. Will I remember Monica's birthday? I will remember Catherine's. Will she be the last whom I'll love?

I did go to the breakfast. It wasn't in the princess place that it was going to be. It was fine. No, it wasn't. Catherine was going to pick me up. Yesterday's night I didn't ask my dad to move the pick up and jetta because I wouldn't need to. The phone sounded by 7:30 to signal me time to get up. I showered and cleaned and shaved. Would it be enough time? It wasn't. There were still some shadow on my upper lip and chin, but still less than before. Even less than the time I was at pride.

Catherine is right, there is an obvious change between then and the next one.

Catherine's parents were in the United States. Her father would take her mom to english classes and then return home to clean Catherine and take her to the breakfast. He didn't. She told them she had to be there by 10. She did. It didn't matter. I ended up wearing the white blouse and long black sweater. Jeans and tennis. At the last minute I swapped them for the monk strap shoes. They are longer but still a little feminine.

I exited before they told us they were on their way. In the morning my grandma was with Luis downstairs. She woke my mom up. My father was down, too, by the time I had finished putting on make up.

I would have to go through all of them. I did. I asked him to move the cars. He asked me where I would be going and when would I return. He gave me some money. 100 more than he always gives me. Was that on purpose?

Did he notice? Paola noticed. By the time she saw me she said I looked pretty. Was he feeling guilty? no. Maybe he was worried.

I parked by the end of the neighborhood and tried to put lipstick. I didn't like how it looked. Neither the pencil nor the stick. I cleaned my mouth with the second to last make up wipe. Just a couple minutes ago I used the last one. 24 times I've gone out. Maybe more, maybe a little less.

Tomorrow is the last day of resting. I want them to end. I need to feel them in my body. I'm tired, exhausted and moody. I could had sent the endo a message, I decided not to.

I had a lost call from Jessica when I was near Lili's. I went to a pharmacy and put credit. They were already there. I arrived almost at the same time that Paola. She entered with me.

We had breakfast and conversations and laughed and clapped and ate cake.

Catherine kept waiting for her father. He arrived almost by 11. It was "her fault" she didn't told them it was important for her to be by 10. He went to the swap meet and lost the lapse of time.

We all met up in the plaza. The movie was irritating. "Oh, Chevo is out with only girls" Paola said to the other one. She didn't say it for me to hear. She didn't have to.

"I wanted to tell you, but I didn't want to make you blush with all of them. You looked very pretty today. I don't know if you were wearing mascara, but your eyes were so pretty."

My legs hurt. I am tired. I want to lie in bed and just rest. Tomorrow I'll go to the United States. I told Catherine I wanted to be brave and dare ask my parents for a pair of shoes. She was excited as if she believed me. I don't dare to. I don't think I will. Even when I started this paragraph I again thought about it and consider it. Both of my parents know. It's not anything to be ashamed. Why am I embarrassed? Is it about the money? No, I would ask him anyway to give me some dollars for when I'd go with Anahi. The money comes from the same place. It's them knowing, seeing. Asking?

"Do you want them? They're woman's"

Luis was the one who said those words with the converse. My father didn't look. Would they this time?

I have to buy pants. Formal pants. Three weeks or is it two?

Catherine told me she could go with me before then. Is that really true?

Am I ready?


## 2016-05-15

I have a headache and a dull pain in my abdomen. I was going to start hte words and yet Catherine just answered my telling her about what possible thing could happen my next endo session. "What are the Tanner stages?"

5 days now. Time really does fly.

I bought the slim pants I wanted. Super slim, 34x30, formal black trousers. I looked for shoes. I asked to go to Nordstrom Racks and then wandered a couple of times in the target in Westfield plaza. I saw the ballet flats. I looked them and considered actually tried them. There were people and I didn't shave.

A little boy looked at me and babbled with a smile. I waved at him and his mother just smiled.

In target something similar happened but the mother grasped him and brought him towards her.

I don't even pretend to consider that I was seen as feminine today.

I caught a couple of glances at me. I did look.

It doesn't matter. I shaved yesterday and irritated myself. Today I didn't. I could shave tomorrow. Until next thursday will be a week since the session. Then I'll give the second report to Hiram's parents. I told my parents' Lili's proposal of being his tutor, offering his parents my assistance as an academic tutor. I could get paid in dollars for going to his house and help him with his homework.

I was nervous, still am a little. Part of me wants to be denied, "thanks but no thanks". "We'll keep the offer in mind and we'll contact you".

The lights just went out and everything shut off.

I drank the iced coffee I ordered in Starbucks late in the evening. I used to brag how it didn't affect me. Of course it does. I might not be able to sleep tonight. Yesterday I couldn't. I finished the Wolf of Wallstreet movie and stayed in bed with aching legs and a throbbing headache.

The phone welcomed me to this new day with the notification that I had broken my all time record of walking. Yesterday I walked almost five miles. That's what I used to walk every other day when I tried to do exercise. A month ago I gave another chance to start that healthy habit. I didn't do today's exercise. The day hasn't ended although I doubt if I'll do today's.

 31 days. I stopped weighting myself, too. I broke the chain of days the moment I stopped doing the routine of waking up, doing them, weighting me and eating breakfast.

We lunched today in Denny's. I ordered from the healthy selection in the menu. A steak and smashed potatoes with squash. A cup of soup and unsweetened iced tea.

What's the point?

I wanted to see the picture of me in a dress. I know I look feminine, female enough. It doesn't look weird or grotesque. There is something that I don't like, though. My body is square and broad. My stomach is a big rectangle and my legs are narrower. I look like a barrel wrapped in a thin fabric.

It's my weight, not my masculinity. I look like a fat woman.

Sure, the only thing besides a body-image complex was another. As if my sex wasn't enough I have to deal with my weight, too...
It might be about the control thing. Or the lack of hormones? I knew that the lack of testosterone will make losing weight harder.

It doesn't matter. I should just continue with the exercise. Going out to walk, try to run. Do something here inside. Keep trying, not give up.

I have the pants and they'll give me a shirt.

They congratulate me in the ceremony. I went to the Scholar Merit award thingie. The people from the University, the dean, they all shook hands with me and smiled and said how was such an honor to be there. It has happened before. It has always happened, since I was in elementary school. Teachers congratulating me, principals. In jr high they didn't know me. Not personally. Although some teachers did. They called for me for a math contest or something, being in the subprincipal's office.

Being called after high school to pick up the ENLACE's scholarship. Driving with the vice-principal, being congratulated again.

It has always happened. It means nothing now. Has it ever meant something? Was it my depression? My name?

Was it me?

Maybe Rene has a point and I am a princess with everything under my touch and yet I own nothing.

I have everything I could desire, all the things in the world but what I really want.

I am the ugly princess.

The princess who was born a prince.

## 2016-05-16

It's been more than 30 days of doing exercise and today I've recovered the routine. I weighted myself with nervousness. I didn't know what to expect. Would a bigger number come? How much? What if now I'd be worse than when I started?

173.2 pounds. 78 kilograms. 3 less than when I started a month ago. One kilo a week is the recommended amount to loose.

That and restarting the hormones was a big pushup to my mood. I miss that peculiar flavor of the red pill. In the internet they described the estradiol pill as blue. I'm not taking that precisely. I am taking half a milligram of conjugated estrogen.

A couple of weeks and I can tell him how the rest period was tiring and upsetting. My dosage is low compared to the guide I've read.

Will he dismiss me? I can't know that. It all depends on the number of the T levels I get those couple of days before. A month exactly until I see him. It's not the middle of the wait time. It's not been 4 weeks.

In two weeks I'll go to Zapopan.

I received a call from Liliana today. She wanted to ask me if she could give my number to the other helper she has. Sure, of course. And then that got me thinking. I'd be helping her, giving her advice and lending my tests. She would get paid, not me. It's not that big of a problem. Except about last week. I gave the results in Liliana's time. And then continued explaining in my hour. She was paid 40 dollars for the hour of the results and I 400 pesos for the other hour. Except she kept the whole amount of dollars and half of mine.

Do I want them to accept the proposal? Should I start researching ways of teaching studying habits? The Syllabus of High School English class?

I am nervous except I don't really know why or about what.

She asked for Ivan, and called me a beautiful boy and if I were busy (masc). I just wrote what I thought in Catherine's conversation. Was it yesterday? No, Saturday. When we were talking in her car I mentioned how I feel pressure with Chevo and the gang. With the analysis lab. I have to go as a woman. Because they know about me, they're asked to call me in a certain way and I have to look the part, for my own good.

Telling Liliana about me is doing that. Just mentioning I've started treatment will bring my name to the conversation. Do I want to keep being called Ivan? Do I want to be referred as Sofia the therapist? What would happen with the patients that already know me?

And that's the thing, I don't know. I'm not ready. Emotionally, physically... I haven't changed enough.

Yesterday I looked for online pharmacies and noticed how for the same amount of flouxetine that I pay 200 pesos I would be paying less than half. 40 pesos a bottle of pills for a week.

In the United States they sell this bottles with hundred pills. It would last me months.

That got me thinking. I want to have money to pay for clothes and shoes. I want to buy those things, but I can't buy everything by myself. I'd prefer to buy clothes than pills. I can use the excuse of asking for the price in Costco. I could tell my mom, give her my prescription or going with her the next time she goes. Passing around the pharmacy and just ask. If it's cheaper I could ask her to buy it there. She would be paying. I could give her the other prescription, talk about that medication. Yes, I'm taking estrogen and t-blockers. Yeah, the name in the prescription is Sofia. That's my name. That's the name Catherine and my friends know me by. That's the one I'll ask to be placed in my corrected birth certificate.

Does she know I'm not really her son? Does my dad?

I know saturday he saw me as I left. We moved the cars and I could see his face as he got off his pick-up. Was he disappointed or upset?
My mom asked about the restaurant. She saw the picture. My aunt liked it.

Do I look the same? Did I look feminine?

I should use the new Facebook. Ask them to use that one.

I could wait those couple of weeks until the trip. Let her pride herself with the pictures of me getting that award and the congratulations to her son. That could be the last time I'd be named Ivan in a ceremony. The last I know of.



## 2016-05-17

Do the days go faster now that they are a really lower number?


Today it's going to be a week, seven days. Tomorrow I'll go to therapy and see Catherine. Yesterday I was at her house. Last night I ended the conversation abruptly. We were talking about today's plans and tomorrow's. This is the beginning of the Psych week in the faculty. The theme was about gender. Silly me, countless times I've been fooled to believe them when they talk about gender. I keep forgetting they mean woman.

The first conference, which I didn't even plan on attending, confirmed the way I feel about the "gender theory" apathy I feel.

She, a master at law, director of the Municipal Center of Women, Lawyer and defender of Human Rights, started her conference about Violence against women. Because Gendered Violence of course is against woman. Even her statistics that showed 7% of women suffer violence and 14% of men, was overlooked.

Familiar Violence, violence against any family member was explained as that against women. Domestic violence: the one women suffer at home.

I was irritated and annoyed. The Hall was full. People were standing. As it ended all took rise and started leaving. I wanted to see the one about the integration of LGBT people and the psychologist's work with them. Just me an a couple more people were interested. If it would had started when it should. Only 5 people would be listening.

Why did I shut off Catherine last night?

She told me her mother's reaction when she told her about the trip to the university. When she asked her for permission. "Uhm, why do you need to go again?" It was better if we just went to the more interesting ones. Maybe just pick one day. If I wanted to go out It would be better Wednesday.

I was angry. I told her. "I'm sick of your mom". "It's not just her... my father also says: "Are you going out again, didn't you just went that day?"" "Well, I'm sick of them both".

It's not the permission. It wasn't just that. I do resent them.

I have to go to her house and be with her, hidden in her room. Dress as Ivan and act the character. Be her boyfriend.

We were watching Game of Thrones and she came into the room when there was a scene with sex. "Don't watch that, kids". I cringed. We're not kids. We're 23, for fuck's sake. I don't want a teenage girlfriend.

It's not her fault. Why do I resent her, too?

I can't pressure her into telling them. Into their knowing. I don't want to be the ones to tell them about me. Why do I want her to tell them?

She was going to pick me up today. She would drive. I wouldn't need to pay anything. And we had to cancel. I went all by myself.

She sent me some messages telling me how she thought about going but didn't feel too well.

I argue with myself when I drove to school. I project my own frustration towards her. I see my own indecisiveness in her. I want the changes and I want to see myself different.

In the morning I received a voice message of Liliana, telling me that she would give the next patient, n3, my number. She would contact me later and we could set up a meeting. Yesterday she asked me if she could sent the girl my number, too, so I could assess her and help her on her own evaluation with the urgent patient of last week.

I am still a little nervous about this thursday. I had forgotten about thinking about the tutorship thingie.

"Would you let me paint your toenails?" I wanted her, too. Nobody would have to see. I could hide them in my socks. Look at them by myself.

Today, the psychologist that gave the presentation of sexual diversity had his nails colored in a pinkish bright red. They were short and clean. He wore an earring, but had short hair and some beard. He was slim but not effeminate. Was he gay? does it make a difference?

"And we don't even include them in the formulary questions, where we just ask about sex and put male and female... whenever that happens, which is horribly wrong I just mark female"

I sat by myself in the corner of the hall. At first, when I got in, I sat behind Suchilt. She didn't see me nor recognized me. I moved, before the beginning, to the corner. By the second one, I move closer.

I felt invisible and hidden. And at the same time, I felt a combination. Androgynous clothes in an androgynous body.

Today I was going to go out with Catherine. We did.

What was it about yesterday? I opened up. I told her how I've been feeling at her house. Why I was upset with what happened the night before. The thing about her parents, about Liam. Being seen as a boy in her house. That's the thing, her mother doesn't even see me as a boy, she sees me as this other thing. Something in between, changing.

It doesn't matter, I told her and she understood. "You didn't say anything, it was all "it's ok, I get it"". "That's because it was the only thing to say. I had thunk about that. It wasn't that I was expecting it, but I knew it would happen sooner rather than later"

We were in Argana. She picked me up from my house. I did the exercise and showered. I shaved in the bathroom and changed downstairs. I applied my make up and combed my hair with my fingers. Catherine was updating me about her location in her drive home. I can't remember the last time she picked me up from home. I missed it.

I looked feminine, feminine enough. I was wearing leggings and the red sweater I wore on my birthday. I took the other sweater, the open necked one, with me. She would lend me a strap blouse to wear underneath.

We parked in the Sam's parking. I wanted to change but couldn't. We moved at first, and towards our second spot a mother and her child walked. They stayed taking the books out of the boy's backpack. I couldn't undress there so I waited.

"I'm hot", "you could change in Rene's bathroom", "No, it's ok", "Put it under the sweater", "I can't I'm wearing this one" "Why are you wearing that?!"

I was sad and upset. I told her to forget it, I could change later. "Can I tell you something and you don't get mad?" "No" I told her and stepped out of the car. I was scared. I knew I could get mad, I could get even sadder. I just wanted to get out. I could see the surprise and regret on her face.

We walked towards Rene's office. Nobody looked at us or saw us. We got in the Oxxo and I bought her a bottle of water. We waited outside of the office. He was with a patient. She's the friend of the girl that was before me a year ago. Does she recognize me? There is something in her face when she looks at me. Do I care? Does it matter?

I had my session and paid for it. The dollar keeps rising. I should buy the tickets for pride now that I can. I can pay them to my father in pesos and keep Cathy's 20 note.

After my therapy we returned to the parking lot and she drove us to the River Plaza. I took my sweater off and stayed in the tank I was wearing. I felt naked with my bare shoulders exposed. The bra straps were showing. My breasts are more noticeable. I thought it was my imagination but they are bigger, fuller.

I liked them and at the same time they scare me.

What if the changes surpasses me? What if I can't change as quick as my body?

I waited in the pharmacy for Catherine's card. She bought what she needed and then we went to the book fair. I felt weird. There was something there. It wasn't the people or even the sights. I was irritated and uncomfortable. I felt like that last time I had gone to an artesanal expo with Monica. I was tired and felt sick. I just wanted to leave. We had a fight because of it.

Catherine just asked me if everything was alright because she saw me uncomfortable. I told her the truth. "Do you want to leave?" "No, it's ok. Maybe, I don't know". We left.

She drove us to the beach. We were going to eat pizza. I was hungry and she ate breakfast even sooner than me.

We stayed outside the park and in the car. She offered me to walk in the harbor or going to Argana. We could eat there or the sushi place I had proposed. We decided for Argana.

We had a different waitress from the one last week. "Has someone taken your order, girls?, are you ready [feminine]?"

She brought us our food and kept referring us as woman.

I didn't change nor clean my face before entering home. My mother, father and grandma were sitting on the table as I entered.

"How good you are at telling your leaving". My grandma was looking for me at noon. She didn't know I had left.

Nobody mentioned my outfit nor face. Not even Luis when he entered my room before I even started changing.

Do they know? Are they blind? Am I invisible?

## 2016-05-19

"I miss you already. Where is it that you are going to the master?... Do you know about the one they're going to open here in Cetys?" "No, I prefer going to the capital. For me it is best going there."

I could had told her. That was the perfect opportunity.

I did today's exercise and weighted myself. Thighs, mostly. It was hard and tiring. I ate like 8 cookies. Tomorrow I'll probably weight more. I might see Catherine. She wanted to ask me something about the tests. I just want to be out. I can shave and wear something feminine. Somewhere were we will be welcomed and attended. I just want to be seen.

Yesterday I was filling the info for the new Facebook profile. I told Catherine how I started updating the video I had sent her before she had arrived for me. I stopped just before writing the description. People on Facebook follow me there. There is a lot of acquaintances who could had seen it. Is that what I want?

Once I thought and wondered and considered and even typed the draft in my phone about the text I could publish in my profile.

I asked Catherine about what she thought.

We were in her car, driving home. I remembered my fear of injections. It's so relieving to realize that I have lost that fear. I have overcome it. Will that happen when I finally get rejected and I won't die? How relieving would it finally be to get that bigger fear?

Doesn't that have something to do with this? Sure there would be people supporting me and sending me comments and whatever. But what if someone else says something different? What about the people who won't add me? Won't they be rejecting me? They sure would be ignoring me. It would be a confirmation of my feeling of being invisible and unnoticed.

Yeah, she was right when she said that.

But then again, even one people who would add me would mean a person who accepts me just as I am. No roles, no characters, no more pretending, just unconditional support.

Am I scared? Yeah.

It is what I have been thinking.

Luis doesn't know. I picked him up today. He knocked on my door after I had walked through the table full of adults. He asked me if I could pick him up and his eyes noticed my leggings and my shirt and my eyes and lips.

I left for him a quarter after noon. I read a couple of chapters as I waited. Rossy walked with a walkie talkie in his hand and looked at the cars. She recognized me and didn't have to ask about Luis. Again, as she passed my window, she called "Sofia".

I told my mom about Costco and the medicine. I could ask about the prices, about the quantities. She said tomorrow she could go. This Sunday Miguel will have the rehearsal of the elections.

I gave the last results. The whole family was sitting in the room. I was left alone. Lili had to leave. It was just me unsupervised. I was comfortable. I tumbled some times and my words came tangled up and repeating. It was fine. I was payed. Nothing was set on stone about the tutorship. His father asked me if I could give him some books or helping him being more social.

I'm relieved is over. Tomorrow Liliana will call the other patient and tell her I will call her.

Another one who will see me as Ivan.

She asked me about the phone. She called me as I was dressed as a girl, presenting as a girl, and called me a handsome boy. I should had told her. It was the perfect time. She asked me about the master, why do I want to go there. "I prefer going there, it's better for me"... because there I can change my name and papers. Because there is safer for people like me, you know, trans.

I was meaning to make a mention. Ask her for advice. I need to tell her that I've started.

"Liliana, you remember about my, you know, situation. Catherine has told you, I guess. You knew me as Ivan and Sofia. I am trans. You've seen me dressed as a boy and as a girl. With the patients I was nervous and scared. I didn't know how to act, how to present. With the first one I was Ivan.

And sure, it was my plan all along, keep being "Ivan" professionally until I can leave to the capital and fix the papers. But I'd be lying if I said it's not tiring and a little difficult to keep this persona and role.

And, besides that, there's something else. I don't know what to do. I have started treatment. Now I'm a month on hormones and had taken a couple of laser sessions. The medication is making its effect. I guess I am scared that the changes will be faster than my own preparation.

Even now, I can't even tell you this."

Just as I can't tell my brothers and I couldn't tell my parents.

## 2016-05-20

Yesterday I read a comic about a transgender woman. Today I finished it until the latest post. I finished another one of a chilean one. They keep mentioning Santiago, and how the gay marriage in that country was still illegal and how the treat of her german friend was Palta.

I liked the art. It was simple and yet stylish.

I changed the cover picture of the Facebook profile. I haven't added anyone, yet.

I was sitting in the restroom and my mind kept wandering.

Today Catherine picked me up. When did we plan the meeting? She would come after noon. My mother took my grandma to the bus station. She left me two burritos of egg and a cup of lentils. I ate breakfast an hour after waking up. I heard the conversation like most days I do. I couldn't come back to sleep.

I'm avoiding Catherine. She sent me a message to whatsapp and I saw the conversation and yet I haven't opened it. Why am I doing this? We have talked about going to the United States, she even offered going Monday. We talked about going to the swap meet. There is transportation on the weekends. There are cheap t-shirts and clothes.

In the afternoon Anahi started a conversation with me and we ended up in that theme. I could go with her. We will see each other Wednesday. Do I know what I will wear? Does she? We should go shopping. Tuesday in the afternoon.

I answered the texts.

"Can I tell Catherine? she might buy us food". Why is it awkward? When I told her, she answered back that maybe we should go just the two of us.

Why did it irritate me? I asked for a reason. She will come to my house to watch the episode of Game of Thrones. Then Tuesday going to the US and Wednesday to the movies. It's all about permissions again, her parents.

The thought of last week came back. "It's so fucking tiring to be in a relationship with a 15 year old".

Am I avoiding her because I don't want to hurt her or because I don't want to hurt myself?

I will end up going with Anahi alone. Will I buy anything? I can, want to, buy shoes. I want to buy clothes. I could look for a white dress. T-shirts or blouses. Pants I have a couple. Skirts? I would not wear them.

I should buy the least I can. My body, I hope, will be changing. I want to lose weight, lose width in some places and gain in other ones.

She put the image in Anahi's conversation. She laughed.

Today she came home and I received her with the jeggings and her black blouse she lend me. Over it I wore the long white shirt with black stripes, opened. I changed bras twice. First it was the black one. Then I put on the blue to see if it would make some cleavage. I came back to the black one.

We started kissing and laid in bed. We fucked like we hadn't in a long time. I touched her, she touched me. I narrated like she used to. "Do you like it how my fingers play with your clitoris? How yours are touching mine? I love how both our hands are in each other's vaginas."

We both nearly climaxed. She penetrated me. I returned to making her come. We stayed in bed naked under the sheet. We were laying there, in silence, when the keys open the locked door and the sound of steps moved us from bed. She covered herself in my sheets and I stood up to lock my door. It was Miguel. He opened the fridge and then went upstairs. We put on our clothes again and got ready for leaving.

She picked up some shoes for her mom. I accompanied her and watched the catalogue. We looked around Coppel and some other stores. She took me to Macroplaza to eat. Alitas. We were welcomed in the feminine way by both waiters. I couldn't hear the second time she addressed us after we ordered the drinks and she heard my voice.

I knew I looked fine. I knew I looked feminine. I had sent a snap to several people and Anahi answered back "pretty".

Why did the reflection in the windows and mirrors lied to me then?

I kept seeing the man I see yesterday in most of my pictures.

Will he ever disappear?

In the bathroom I remember the pictures, today's leggings. Did I took hormones when I went to the Universal Studios? Had I started yet?

Tomorrow it'll be exactly a month. 21st of April was the day I started. Would that be my second birthday? Am I one month old?

## 2016-05-21

I think I just said the wrong thing.

"How am I not getting exalted? I fucking hate your mom. Just now, look what happened. You were going out, you told her and she "just forgot", and you're going to work, goddamn it, something she doesn't.
"'Come pick me up and that's it', the fuck?, you don't ask her to pick you up and yet she bothers you everytime you go out. she didn't even ask 'can you come', no, 'come pick me up'.
"She's always out and you have to count the times you leave, don't be fucking kidding me."

"You are a 15 year old girl that "doesn't have to tell her, you have to ask for permission", but at the same time have the fucking responsibility of picking her up because she can't take a bloody cab

"Leave now so you're on time, she will surely reprimand you that how you dare be late and making her wait"

"The last one hurt me. Sometimes you can be very cruel".

She had a reason for not wanting to tell me about her mom. I do get mad. Why does it bother me so much? She's right now explaining herself. I might be right, but it hurts her. She doesn't express herself like I do. She doesn't know what to do, how to solve her situation.

I don't know what to do myself. I feel, too, how she's stuck. I am frustrated as well. I never told her about the thought I had when I cut the conversation. When was it and because what? Was it when I told her I was sick of her parents?

"I'm fucking tired of being in a relationship with a 15 year old."

Was that what hurt her? Was the age? I know feeling like a child is a sore spot to her right now. She feels she's in an arrested development. It hurts her not being able to grow, needing their help more than the last years. She was independent, lived by herself, needed nobody in another country. That's why it was so damaging coming back and being treated again as a child. Now, after surgery, needing care from their parents feels like confirming her helplessness. Like a kick being down.

"You didn't talk to me yesterday because of that?" "I don't remember if it was yesterday" Last night it was because of not being able to go to the United States. No, I told her I wouldn't touch the subject. It was before. It was when I told her I had enough of her parents. That thought is older than a night. Yesterday I felt bad because of the pictures, how I perceive myself.

It's almost 9 and she hasn't leaven.

Today I woke up early and we went to the United States. The business cards were already in the mail. The spit kit had arrived, too. We ate in the Jack in the box. I haven't done today's exercises. In target I looked around the shoes section. I passed by the woman's clothes. I didn't even wander through the man's area. I bought a mason jar for drinking water. Luis wanted pizza. From the Starbucks I ordered a coffee frappe. It was too sweet and a little disgusting.

The cable from my earphones keeps grazing my nipple through the t-shirt. It feels so sensitive. Today is a month since the start. May 21st. Less than four weeks I can talk to the endocrinologist. A little more than three I will get blood drawn again.

She hasn't answered. Maybe she left already. Part of me wants to be right, I want her mother to scold her for being late. "I told you to pick me up a quarter before 9". I would be correct, and she would be devastated. Being right would mean the worst for her. "I'm not telling it's not true". And then a confirmation of her being both a child and responsible for her mother.

I changed the picture from the Facebook profile. I added both her and Anahi. She was my first friend, just as in real life a couple of years ago. She was the first person to meet me. Anahi was the second.

"I love you" she sent me in a text. "I love you, too" I answered with an emoticon. "Precious". Did she see the notification? Did she see the profile?

"Adding me doesn't just mean my mother seeing. Everyone from college and high school might see it, too. Are you ok with that?"

I didn't know. I had thunk about it. I hesitated.

I guess I was alright. I hope I am.

## 2016-05-22

It hurts me to live a fragmented life.

The screen is blue with an F enclosed in the upper screen. Before, whenever I would sign out, this welcome screen would appear the next time I opened the application. It offers me to enter just selecting the picture of my face over "Ivan". The first couple of times I signed into the other application felt like the times I would go out with Catherine or wear the attire for a time in the hotel. An exit from daily life and signing into this different persona. I finished the profile yesterday and started adding people. All of my close circle of friends have me there. So it would fit this surreal excitement and feeling of accomplishment when the notification popped up offering me to get a one click sign in. The new picture and name in the welcome screen. It would be so convenient. The phone knows it's my profile. Mine. It's me.

I didn't expect the familiar pain of seeing both pictures and names. Two personas. I am two people. Different and separated. I am a broken entity. Some days I'm one and others the other. With some people I'm known as this and to others that. Even by the same person I can be called by two names in the same day.

"That you haven't done it, that you've not been able doesn't mean that you won't be able to, Sofi. See how far you've gone this year.
Every time you're closer to living a single life, yours, being whom you are"

"Did you know some people say there might had been a transexual general in the Mexican Revolution?"
Did you know I am one, too? Did you know one lives with you in this same house?
"What?"
He repeated himself.
"Where did you see that?"

I keep thinking he knows something, suspects something. What if he asks because of him?

Why does it keeps scaring me?

I won't hide my clothes nor my make up. Not anymore. "Are you wearing make up?" Yeah. "Are those woman's clothes?" Sure.

I keep practicing those words. Will I be able to pronounce them? Won't I be mute?

Tomorrow Catherine will see her patient again. She'll come after. We will see the Game of Thrones episode of today. I watched a movie. Amores perros. I posted it in my Facebook profile. Do I feel the need to use it like I felt with Twitter? I can't remember the last time I posted something there.

The day after tomorrow I will take Catherine to the United States. A couple of fights came because of that plan. She will go after all. I need her. I feel weak and needy, but I do. I could go by myself or even with Anahi. But I know it's not the same.

Will this be the first time that we'll go shopping, the three of us? The plan with Anahi was to buy something for the day after, our going to the movies with Paola. "A girls' movie time", she mentioned. It feels so gracious, like a favor done specially to me. I keep remembering how I told Rene. It's damn if they do, damn if they don't. I thought those comments would neglect me. And now that they're inclusive I don't believe me. I am the one who rejects herself.

I do get sadder. The rest period has ended so that is no longer an excused. I am on my 5th week of hormones. 32 days. by the 56th would be the 8th week and time to get reviewed. Monitored. My levels would be checked, he would ask me for effects, how I've been feeling. I keep downplaying my progression thinking of the low dose and how there has been no significative changes and my levels will be similar.

I prepared what I could show him and ask for a larger dose.

Time keep passing. In a week I'll be in another city, boarding a plane to another State. A day after I'll receive a medal and an award. A couple days after the next week I'll be again in the laser place, getting my facial hair zapped. A couple of days later, I'll be dressing femininely to get my blood drawn. A couple of days later, I'll be seeing him. He will be seeing me. Will he note changes? Will he tell me how he got me in a low dose on purpose to check for secondary effects or because he perceived that I have a natural high levels of estrogen? No.

I don't know. There is still time until then. There should be other things in my mind.

## 2016-05-23

I woke up like any other day. I don't remember dreams. Yesterday I narrated the last one just before sleeping. The lift nad running in a suit. As it climbed the floors it went narrower and narrower. Jessica was with me. I carried a luggage.

I did the exercise and weighted myself. The whole routine that I've been avoiding. I thought, was afraid of the number being so much higher. It stayed constant. Just like the one from three days ago. That number is not the lowest but is 7 pounds lower than a month ago. That's good.

I ate the tacos that my grandma made me. The biscuit is still in the fridge. She was preparing food. "Your mother said to ask you if you wanted me to cook the meat in the freezer. If you thought it was old, you could buy some and she'd paid for it when she arrives."

I didn't want to leave home. The plan was showering and putting pajamas. I would receive Catherine casually. Now I had to say no. I had to deny them going. I was in the bathroom when she came with the news. "No, cook the meat, it's alright, I don't want to leave."

I felt down. It's so much burdening to feel their needs. If I don't go, there won't be anything to eat. My grandma can't drive. Miguel is in school. Everyone is busy. I don't do nothing. A little favor is too much to ask me.

I don't know how to ask for meat. What should I ask for? "What do you want young man?" I will be told. It hurt even imagining it.

I don't want any. Cande put some soup and rice. I stayed in the couch. It might not be such a good idea for Catherine to come. Everything was ruined because some really stupid shit.

It just went off.

I entered the shower and cleaned myself. I put shampoo and conditioner. I used for the first time the cream I bought for styling my hair. I even shaved my legs in there. I opted for using the machine. Tomorrow I can go for a closer one. I drove to the meat place near home, besides the first oxxo. I entered the place where they sell tortillas and bought the chorizo. The Oxxo was closed and there were no chicken in the meat place. I drove to the other one near the Calimax. I bought the chicken there and the chipotle chilis.

It was before all of this when I was standing in my room doing something in the phone as it sounded and the logo of the UABC appeared in the screen. They had the information of the hotel and the flight. I should just take a black pair of formal trousers and they'd give me the shirt so all from the university will go matching.

That was the fist phone call. The second was the patient. At first I tried to answer the same way I did with the university except it didn't come thru. It was a missed call. I tried returning the call but it was misdial. I just decided to wait. Catherine was just leaving to meet her patient. She'd be here by 4 and a half. He was late but arrived just at the limit of time she decided to give him.

Cande kept asking me if I wasn't hungry. Was I going to wait for my mother to arrive?

By four someone called home. I picked up the phone and didn't recognized the number. I answered with an androgynous voice. Not too feminine but yet changed still. I found familiar the one from the auricular. "Who is this? " It was Miguel. He left his keys behind the television. I felt how my voice lowered as I recognized him. Did he notice?

He stayed in the table eating. My grandma made him some eggs and warmed a bowl of rice with beans.

Just minutes before Catherine's arrival they both went upstairs. We ate together in the table and shared my mason jar filled with tea. The phone rang for the third time. This time I could answer the patient. I set the meeting for 6 o'clock this thursday. It was all set. I will have another patient.

 After the meal I put on the episode. The sound of the keys in the door made me pause the show as my dad entered. I thought it was going to be Luis or my mom. They came later. A little after they entered, my grandma came down. They have met already.

Tomorrow I'll see her again. I could gather 75 dollars. That should be enough. Yeah. I could buy some things.

Why am I nervous? Nothing bad should happen. I will wear feminine clothes but not completely. They can't deny me entrance for looking "gay". It's not a disguise. I won't be having make up. Not much anyway.



## 2016-05-24

I'm home. I've taken my pills and refilled the organized with the missing ones that Catherine bought with her card.

According to the app in my phone today's walked steps are over 7 thousand. I don't know how many kilometers are that. I bought what I was supposed to buy. I wanted flat shoes and t-shirts and I even bought a blouse. I tried a dress.

It should be enough, why it doesn't feel that way? Even crossing the border as I was wearing nothing but foundation somebody offered something to us saying ladies. It wan't the only one. In Victoria's Secret the lady approached Catherine and me with the same opener. Ladies. There were one or other person who I know saw me in the same way.

I was nervous. There was almost no line. Catherine kissed me and left the mark of her kiss, like a signature on my cheek. I felt along the day this weird sensation in my anus. At first it was uncomfortableness. Now it's a really low pain. Last week was when Catherine came and we fucked in my bed. It's been days. It's not that, is it? No. It must be something else.

I sat in a bench after crossing the border. I was asked just where I was going, nothing else. Have a really great day, the officer wished me with kindness. Do people notice? He saw my picture and name. He saw me. I tied my hair and crossed the sweater over my chest. In the bench in the trolley station I opened my purse and asked Catherine if I finished my make up. One person saw me as a girl. It was confirmed, why did I still need it? I felt void and vulnerable. As if a part of my face were missing. I don't want the make up to look "pretty"
I want it, need it, to look normal.

She told me to wait until Anahi arrived. I could put it on in her car. I don't know how to do it when it's moving, I explained. We could stop and do it before stepping down to the mall. "Could you help me?" "No. Do it yourself."

She asked me if it hurt me. Why did I say no? It wasn't precisely hurt how I felt. I was upset and angry. It's not fair. I wish I could put it on in my house, too. I wish I could just wear it normally and everyday. It's not because I hide it from the people who live here. Would I had exited and let my grandmother see me?

I took a pair of jeans for when I return. They still are in the car. On the floor are the box of flats, too. Why won't I wear them tomorrow from here?

I ate two tacos and then a bowl from chipotle. That's all of the intake from today. I lost a fraction of a pound in the scale.

I went by myself to the dressing room. A blouse, a t-shirt and a dress. I tried everything on. They were L, and they fit. I looked fine. I really did. From the three items I tried, I only bought one. The other three t-shirts are of different colors. One is XL and the other two are L. The L ones don't fit me. They do, but they are too slim. I feel like a bloated piece of meat wearing them. I feel like my body is puffed up and muscular, like an adult wearing the clothes of their younger sibling.

I have shoes now.

What will I wear tomorrow? Both to therapy and to the movies. I do want to go, I do want to be seen and noticed.

Does that hurt me? That they are really no comments in this house? I am unnoticed.

I talk and am not heard. In the gas station the attendant put his ear in the window. He welcomed me in hte masculine form. And yet he didn't hear me.

When I try to change my voice it comes out as a whisper. A shy try of words.

The cashier in the payless shoes asked me if my hair was naturally curly. It looked pretty. Do I mind, even now I just recognize how they say my hair looks good. I don't look pretty with my curly hair, no, my hair on my head looks pretty. As if it were an extension separate of me.

Am I that? A separation? My hair is pretty, my chest is feminine, my crotch is masculine.

I am both Sofia and Ivan.

I am not a girl nor a boy, I'm a chimera.

I cried a little on the way home. I almost cried in the start of my session.

I'm typing these words. I haven't talked with Catherine since we said our good-byes outside La Creperia. Paola didn't show up. Her parents had problems with their car and were waiting for a mechanic.

The untranslated items of the NEO300 are on top of my laptop. I try sharing my frustration and impotence with Rene about don't knowing how and when to come out as a female psychologist. He answered back saying how it was an opportunity. I had big chances with working from within the community. Is that really what I want? Catherine remembered me the comment I said. Do I really want to spend my whole life surrounded by people like me? Will I define myself because of my "situation"? People will go with me not because of my abilities or my personality, I will literally be defined by the state of my genitals. I would be the trans psychologist.

I am doing fine. Not really, I am getting 200 pesos each week. That's not enough to make a living. Yeah, I am just starting.

"You're doing well... you are doing nothing... you're not giving your card or your CV around" I was hurt by that. It hurts me that they say I don't do nothing. I tried, again and again. It wasn't just when I felt bad or that I gave my curriculum on purpose to places where they asked for female applicants. Maybe that was the last brick of the wall.

I wore the flats that I bought yesterday. I wore one of the blouses, a purple one, the t-shirt that was L instead of XL. On top I put the black sweatshirt I took from the laundry basket. It smelled good enough. I had make up already, black eyelashes and red lips, when I decided to tell DoÃ±a Cande I would be leaving. I said aloud but she didn't hear me. I climbed the stairs and again spoke. The same silence. I had to do it, I had to come in and show myself. Except I did not, really. The third time she heard and answered back.

My feet hurt from the walk. I was early. The tears almost made an appearance as I talked about the complications I have because of whom I am. It's tiring and frustrating and I wish I didn't have to go through this.

I met Catherine in the parking lot. Everyone of the three of us was driving their car. Did somebody gendered me correctly today? Rene told me "como ibas vestido?" "el unico trans". I kind of expect it from him. Liliana called me "mi niÃ±o hermoso". Anahi told us: "Â¿dÃ³nde estÃ¡n estacionados? Los llevo". Catherine said: "nosotros". Paola told us she would not catch up with us because of her parents after saying "chicos!".

She said it herself, it would be a girls' evening. Even then, both Catherine and Anahi were upset and difficult. We ate in the DinastÃ­a 12. I ordered and iced coffee and Catherine a chai tea. After Anahi's arrival each one of us asked for a sandwich. We were leaving to GalerÃ­as, when I saw how they were stopped. I returned in reverse to where they were. Paola's last misgendering and yet they were indecisive about what to do.

Anahi didn't want to see the movie, she asked about going to argana. Catherine wanted to see the movie, she told me herself. Even then, they looked at me and didn't want to choose. I can't remember who was the one to make the call. I asked to follow her but she dismissed me. I left.

In Argana I realized they would ask our ids with Anahi. She looks youngish. What would happen? Catherine didn't want to choose a flavor. I said I wouldn't even be smoking. The were difficult again. Now there was no point in smoking just the two of them. Anahi wanted a crepe but here were expensive and the nutella was extra. What to do, stay or leave? Again nobody said anything. The waitress came and asked our order. I took the call this time. I was annoyed and angry.

In the ride home I thought about all of that, and the misgendering came up again.

And instead of anger I felt such sadness that I cried by myself.

I wore flats, woman's jeans, a blouse, everything but my sweatshirt was female. I wore make up, I looked "fine". What more do I need to do? What more do they expect? What am I lacking so I can stop being seen as a man?

I can't take this anymore. I am tired, sick of this. Can I correct them? Do I deserve it?

Have I done enough?

When will I accept myself?

## 2016-05-26

Look at me, come on. Come, enter, see me. I'm showing you, I'm exhibiting myself. I'm naked. Why don't you notice me?

I talked about yesterday with Catherine. I feel sad and down. I'm tired. Catherine and Anahi were right. I couldn't sleep in the night. "I'm sorry, your mom and I kept you up at night with our chat", yeah, they did. "At what time did you went upstairs?" "2 in the morning".

I had to get up from the bed in the late night or early morning to take a couple of pills for the pain. My feet were hurting and acting. A day in woman's shoes and I was miserable.

I sent the first message to Catherine since yesterday's good bye. "Are you angry?"

She stayed in Playas. I saw when Anahi's car left and I took a right turn in the park when she kept straight. Catherine's car didn't leave. She stayed there and started crying. She couldn't drive like that. She only remembered the phrase she told me, that I was doing nothing. That I keep doing nothing to change my job situation.

She explained how she felt upset since Paola's cancellation. I remember a week ago when they planned it. Seeing this movie. "Why this one? I really want to see this one", she told me. She wanted to see it just with me. I offered her to see it before everybody. Going just the two of us. We didn't have to tell anybody. She felt it was unfair. I spent through the same thing with the Captain America one and I didn't get to see it before.

So, yesterday, they planned it and one didn't want to go and the other one didn't even show up. She couldn't get mad with Anahi because of what was she going through so she got mad with me instead.

Until we left did she notice how she treated me the whole day.

Did I? Notice.

It wasn't that what made me cry on the way home. Nor today when we talked about.

I was telling her the impotence I get of kept being seen as a man. Sure, they can call me Sofia and say she or her. Yet I am betrayed by the plurals. "I don't know what goes through their heads that they mess up the plurals. I do. I know what to infer.

They might see me as female. Yet they don't see me as the same type of female. They accustomed themselves to call me as she. "Whenever I talk of him, remember to use she". I am the freak who changed sex. But I am not the same as Catherine. So, when they talked about the two of us. The use the neutral one. That's more unconscious. The reflex is gone. They see the multitude and if they talk about Catherine and Anahi, they are two women. If they talk about me and Catherine, we are a woman and something else. In spanish with a single element not being female, you use the neutral masculine form.

And so, they ask about us, or use we or the male adjectives.

I am betrayed by my own language. This analysis would be impossible were we speaking english. In english I wouldn't even notice until a third party was talking about me. I wouldn't have to think about myself. My language would be ungendered.

In spanish, now, here, I have to betray myself almost everytime I speak. Whenever I try to describe how I am, I ought to decide for a gender. Every time a stranger mets me, I get to see how they see me. Wether I am welcome in the feminine or they ask if Catherine and I are ready to order in the feminine way. There I could be sure they see us as equals. Listas, they said. The a assures me they see women, and since there are just two of us, the s confirms that they see me, too.

It's the people I know the ones that hurt me. It's not their fault. It's unconscious. Paola and Anahi are the two who've tried to support me the most, who would never do something to hurt me. It's me, it's how I look, how I present. How I let them know me.

It's the people closest to me the ones that make me feel worse.

I got 200 pesos from the interview today. I received 8 bills of 50, and left four in Lili's drawer. I used two of them to buy bread. I could had just bought one or two for me. And yet I bought for everyone.

I might not even eat any tonight.

## 2016-05-27

I almost forgot to take my pills. I remember how when I started with the antidepressants it was such impossible to even imagine the day I would forget to take them. Weeks later I would leave them here in a trip to Mexicali or remember to take them late at night.
This was the first time that I didn't take the hormones as soon as I finished breakfast.

Should I put an alarm in my phone? They could remember me to take them, make a habit out of it. Like the making of these words. Almost a year since I started.

I'm eating bread, the third of the kind I stopped to buy yesterday after my session. The second one today. My mason jar is filled with Colacao. I was woken up by the phone. It rang and nobody picked it up. I did. I answered with my normal voice. Edgar thought I was Miguel. He ask me to pass him "my nana". I just walked and brought her the phone. I came back to bed. It's her birthday. I was tired and stayed in bed until almost noon.

I don't have to interpret any tests yet. I haven't administered any.

I offered Catherine to go and see the movie we missed Wednesday. Just the two of us, like the original plan. I got up from bed and walked out of my room. I congratulated my grandma and went to warm the breakfast she had prepared. Today's exercise was push-ups so Idecided to skip it. Yeah, I'll gain weight. I don't care. I don't want to get my arms wider.

I ate and then stayed in the living room. I forgot.

I sent my mom a text asking her if we were going to do something for my grandma. She didn't answer until I sent her the second an hour later telling her I was going out. "Do we take her to eat?" I was angered and frustrated. What's the point in having people who loved me if I receive nothing in return? My parents don't know my name, or the process of my transition, my friends still see me as Ivan. I don't feel comfortable. And yet I am pressured. I give more than I receive.

I don't feel like that anymore. Typing it makes me look like a spoiled brat. They know, and try to understand. If they ignore something is because I don't tell them. Because I am scared.

I decided to go out with Catherine. She picked me up. I wore the jeggings and the other L blouse. Over it the denim shirt. I paintedm y face, even wore a little color on my lips. I didn't care about being seen. Both Luis and my grandma were in the livingroom. I just wanted to be seen as a woman. I'm so sick of being seen as him, as a boy.

I walked towards Catherine's car and saw her following my path with her phone. She was wearing a dress and a denim vest. Her eyes were covered in two black circles.

We tried to catch the show in the River plaza so there would be time left in the evening after the movie. We bought the tickets ten minutes after the starting hour. Even after the stairs and the walking to the theater and the masculine welcome of the guy who took our tickets, we sat in our seats before the actual movie started. I was quiet and sad. I was deflated and demotivated. I know it was probably a mistake, an automatic response. It felt awful, though. The familiar frustration and impotence of two days ago. What else do they need or want? What is it that I am lacking still?

After the movie Catherine drove us to the teriyaki place near the university. We sat inside and ate. Nobody gendered me anyway. We took pictures before our plates arrived. She told me how she liked the way I looked. I looked very feminine when she returned from ordering. My clothes, my face, my hair...

Why would people see me otherwise, then?

Even I, after returning home, after waiting in the couch and being seen by every member of my family. I entered my room and looked at me in the mirror. I was going to take the clothes off and put my pajamas on. But I caught that glimpse and I kept looking. I saw my face, my clothes, my body. I liked it. I didn't want her to go. I didn't want to take the clothes off, or clean the make up.

I don't want to see him in the mirror.

I don't care anymore. I want everybody to stop seeing me like that. I don't want myself to ever see me like that.

## 2016-05-28

I haven't filled the agenda since I can't remember when. This will be the last night until the trip. Tomorrow will be the last event I had anticipated.

I went to the United States. I woke up early. It was before 9 in the morning. My father was in the living room. Almost everyone was ready. We came back from the other side of the border before noon. Most of the times, by that time we're usually still on this side, before crossing.

I sent the saliva sample. That was the first place we went to. It wasn't the postal Annex place where Robin, the woman with yellow hair knows us. It was in that plaza, but a little beyond. The United States Postal Office. I had never entered before. It's gone, it's sent. It's just a little more wait until they receive the results and I have an answer back.

In target we were just the four of us. I didn't dare to wander off and look for clothes. I bought a pajama bottom of deadpool and three t shirts without any sleeves. Tank tops? They're man's, so they're not blouses. Will I wear them?

I haven't done the luggage. I always wait until the last moment. I remember when I was in elementary school, those later years and I used to fantasize about going on a trip. Preparing the bags and clothes, boarding the plane, visiting those new places. Would I even had imagined the trips I would make? The places I'd meet and the people I'd know.

In these last years I've traveled to Guadalajara, Monterrey, England, Spain, Belgique, Netherlands, Portugal. I traveled across Spain and then later I would travel with Catherine to Guadalajara again and within the state. Tomorrow I'll board another plane. It doesn't excite me anymore. It's a little annoying. I'll spent the morning with her. The rest of the day will be in a bus, in the airport and in a plane, surrounded by people who know me as this person I used to be. I'll be called Ivan and seen as a man.

I want to shave, I want to wear feminine clothes, I want to look as a woman, but I can't. I have to present my id and be recognized as I legally am. The day after tomorrow I will be dressed in a formal attire and be named in a ceremony along with hundreds of people to receive an award.

This is the last time, assured me Catherine yesterday. The graduation was supposed to be the last one. They keep coming and coming.

I have no way of winning. I don't want to look as a man, but I don't want to look as a woman either. I'll be with Catherine and going to eat breakfast. I'll be received in the school and escorted to the bus to be taken to the airport two hours away from here. I'll be seeing Anna and Hilda. I don't mind them knowing, seeing me.

Where will I sleep? How will the arrangements be?

Did I make a mistake accepting to go?

The screen of my phone is broken. I thought I had this song already.

"En que momento paso? Como fue? No quise alejarte.
La noche me sorprendiÃ³, te busquÃ©, ya era muy tarde."

Will I listen to music tomorrow? I don't think there is a point in taking the ipod with me. Most of the songs I listen now are in my spotify account.

Catherine posted a picture of 6 little test tubes made for drinking shots in the group of the gang. They started making plans about using them, going somewhere. The date proposed was June 11th. That would be a day after my third appointment with the laser place. I won't be able to shave the next day. I''l look like a man, again, in the beach, again.

It's so frustrating and irritating. I'm fucking tired of being in this situation. I wish, I so wish I could have the courage to tell the world, and feeling free, showing myself however I wanted to.

Now, telling people is not liberating. I don't feel free with them. I feel trapped in my own honesty. I have to look female now. I can't waste the opportunity, now. The changes keep happening and yet I am unsure if they really exist. I see the pictures and note differences.

Tomorrow I'll leave. I'll be back the day before my session with Rene.

I can talk about whatever happens with him. I hope I don't miss the words again.

## 2016-05-29

The day is here. I'm all bather and changed and ready. I hear the sounds of the fork and plate of Luis eating his breakfast. Was I rude when I denied my grandmother "even one little taco"? I feel in a bad mood.

I am wearing a combination of men's clothes and women's. My underwear and socks both are women. My t-shirt and shoes are male. My sweater is something androgynous. I couldn't not do it. I had to hid the microscopic black spots in my facial pores with make up. I even put the ring of the university. How do I look? It was too much manly. I couldn't bear it. I can't. How will I do it?

This is supposedly the real last time they will call my name and do something about school. Every one is harder than the last.

Catherine will leave home in about half an hour. She'll come pick me up and go to eat breakfast. The last two times out they called me by the male form. Today they have to. Whenever I get to school I have to introduce myself as Ivan. They have all our names counted up and organized. X number of boys and Y number of girls. What will Hilda and or Anna do when they see me? It would not be the first time somebody sees me like this.

Do I really care?

What will happen, though, when I board the airplane? They will ask an id to corroborate the boarding pass. I am Ivan, though. I should not be scared. I can use the male voice I have such distaste with, I can explain. Nothing have to happen.

A little more than 3 hours and I'll be leaving the city. 8 hours and I'll be boarding the plane.

Why am I scared and nervous? Why does everything have to be so fucking complicated?

I wish I could had just gone in male clothes and not shaved and presented as Ivan as I did those four years in school. Why am I not able anymore? Why does it have to hurt so much?

At least I won't have to worry about these words. I'll be having the tablet and my book to entertain myself. It will be a lot of waiting. Waiting for Catherine to arrive, then to the food to come, then to the bus to receive me, then to everyone else to board, then to arrive to Mexicali, then to the time of boarding the plane, then to getting to Guadalajara and then to getting into my room. The next day I'll wait to be named and for the thing to be finished.

I'll leave the agenda behind.

I've ben filling it with a couple of days of delay. Will it end up being like the black book of school? With months in blank?

Am I lazy? What is it that impedes me to transcript my life? I haven't still passed the journals from Spain. I have several unfinished notebooks started and discontinued. How do I keep writing here?

I've lost count of the days since the very beginning. Years since those days in highschool I used to write stories. Silly dream of becoming a writer. To me it was a possibility and yet today I laugh. Would I be laughing then If I knew that by my 23 years my dream would be one of becoming a woman? To me it is a possibility.

The counter keeps coming up and up and yet it doesn't reach it's goal. I feel like I'm juicing all that's left of my thoughts and nothing of value comes up. What is it that I am repressing? What dark thought keeps blocking what really bothers me?

I said that thing about foolish dreams. I talked about my fears and frustration of the difficulties I have of being one of "them trans"

It's not fair, it doesn't translate fairly to the english. He didn't mean it that way.

He's doing his best. He should be helping me, not the other way around? Why am I still so "confluente"?

Catherine hasn't answered my test. She was leaving the shower. Will she arrive before my parents leaving? Will I face them?

If I am not as afraid as I deny to be, why do I keep hiding in my room after changing?

Everybody here has seen me already in these pants. The shirt is man's. Why am I scared of being seen almost as much as staying invisible?

## 2016-05-30

I'm in the Telmex auditorium. I'm sitting here in the place where is stamped my name. I've been chatting with Catherine. Yesterday, since the University I've been talking and being with both Hilda and Anna. I was dressed pretty androgynously. I had the jeggings and a tank top with the white and gray sweater over. When Catherine picked me up and took me to breakfast, the waiter welcomed us as ladies.

Hilda was the second person to come. The coordinator that sent me the emails called me when we were parked outside the restaurant. She drove us to Mexicali with a man. I sat besides a lawyer. Hilda and Anna were seating behind me. I gave them two of my cards.

Hilda's mother reached her hand to met mine. She told her something about taking pictures. "You can take turns. You take pictures of, uh and, uh, to you..."

She hesitated with the pronouns. Will she ask her who and what I am, when we return?

I was afraid of whom would I share room with. How would they separate us? I didn't want to be with a man. I didn't want to be a nuisance to a woman. A man would feel weird with me, a woman would do so, too.

In the plane our seats were dispersed. I met my parents in the airport. I stayed with hilda and Anna. We looked for something no eat. Since breakfast we would not take a bite until reaching here. I ordered a chicken soup. They didn't wait for us. After we finally checked in our bags, we stood in line for security. They didn't say anything about the id or my appearance. As we entered the gate's waiting area, the coordinator of scholar services asked opus if we (feminine) were the last. One of them corrected her.

I'm still waiting. They told us that the breakfast would be served by 7 in the morning. The bus would leave at 8 o'clock.

They called the name of the first girl of the list, the one behind me, when they started assembling us for the rooms. They said her name and then one of another girl. I would be with a man. One of the two girls went to the desk and signed the little piece of paper. They said my name and another one with the same last name. "JosÃ© FernÃ¡ndez and Sixto FernÃ¡ndez". I went to the desk. The receptionist gave me the folio with our names written. The lady with the wood table kept repeating the name. Once, twice. I raised my hand and she called it again. "I'm here, I said".

The lunch box they gave us had a ham sandwich, a bag of chips, a can of soda and a packet of cookies. I started eating the sub, amazed that it had no cheese. By the second bite, a rancid milky taste crawled by my tongue. I opened again the bread to inspect it more meticulously. It had a certain kind of white cream with little squares solidified. I tried scraping it with my finger, or just biting it by the edge. The same distaste kept appearing between mouthfuls. I ended wrapping g the tomatoes and slices of avocado with the ham and eat it without any bread.

I changed clothes, put on my new pajama and lied in bed.it might had been a little after one. One hour or a little more passed before I could had fallen asleep.

The first alarm was set at 10 minutes to 6,it sounded just for an instant. I entered to the dark bathroom and sat on the toilet. I brushed my teeth although I hadn't eaten any food yet. I shaved with the machine with the faucet running. I had little black spots but the machine did close to nothing.

I combed my hair with my fingers and the serum my mother bought me. He was the next to use the bathroom. Was he annoyed because of me waking him up? Yesternight we stayed in the little living room of our room, sitting in the two chairs, eating, talking. He was nice enough. He heard my name. I know it because he remarked how I was a FernÃ¡ndez, too. That is actually correct. I didn't know it, none of his four ones.

Would another man had made a comment? Asked something? Why do I wear that kind of clothes, why do I look like that? He actually was the one besides me in the plane. His hair is long and his beard, too.

I feel a rumbling in my stomach. I did eat breakfast. I drank coffee, too, and I feel drowsy and tired.

This thing should had started 8 minutes ago.

I put on the slim pants I bought. They are more flexible and comfortable than other pants. I did like them. They look the same, though, the cut is similar, they're not more tapered than other ones. The shirt they gave is a boring kind of green. It's a man's one. Maybe they all were the same. I stepped down to the breakfast buffet. I took my pills with me wrapped in a little tissue. I had planned taking them in front of Hilda. Yesterday after landing and disboarding the plane, she asked me to hold her sweater. "I have to take my pill". "oh, is it for your throat?" "No, they're actually anticontraceptives."she answered back nonchalantly. I could do the same.

"Why do you take so many pills?" "Oh, they're just anticontraceptives."
It's funny trying to imagine her face, her reaction.

"These two, they make me smile, this one makes me cry more, this one makes me less manly, and this one makes me not being pregnant."

Did thus saved already? I lost an almost 200 streak because of a fucking phone.

It appears to be starting.






## 2016-05-31

Fuck me. It would had happen again had I not returned to try again.

I'm home. I've returned from my trip. Rene sent me a text message asking if he could see me at 10 or noon. It's better this way, I guess. It's fine.

On the way home, I told the woman Ruth, the coordinator of scholar services that I would be coming home with my parents. I fell asleep most of the way. I could not sleep in the plane.

The last entry, the one from the day before, is written from the auditorium. Did I write about the bathroom? Was it the first time someone gendered me female that day?

After returning to the hotel, I went straight to my room and changed into jeans and the pinkish red tank. I planned on using the long black sweater but instead I put on the white shirt. Sixto, my roommate was already sitting down waiting for the food. I sat beside him and there were other people, too. Just men. Mostly Law students from Mexicali. They were talking about what they would do, the places they would go. The coordinator, the white haired woman was sitting on the other side of the tables. There were salad plates already placed in front of each seat.

"Gentlemen, invite your lady mates. Take them with you, don't leave them alone."

It was jr high again. I was one of the men. It was the opposite of the comment I almost posted last night about a group of only females being called by the neutral male because of my presence. Now we were a group of only men even though I was present. It's not about not being noticed. It's being noticed and still not changing anything. I didn't want to spend the rest of the trip like that. A little after came Ana and told the woman how she was going to stay with her family. "Oh, it's ok, I trust your family. I know you will be ok with them. Let me just give you my phone in case you need anything." She left. I assumed Hilda would go with her. I felt betrayed, abandoned. They would spend the day with Ana's family, they might show her the city. I would be here with these men. Just like Spain when I tried to fit in with the people in the botellones.

The salad had cheese and it was hard eating enough so the plate would not seem full. The soup was garlic cream. It tasted just as it sounds. Almost as distasteful as the way I was already feeling. The main dish was served to the side of the white haired woman. It was Pasta Alfredo with salmon or something like that. I would not eat it. I felt frustrated. I remembered my family. My family was there, too. I told Sixto I would go for my phone and to tell the waiter that he could take the plate.

Up there, I sent my mother a message. Had they already eaten? No. Could I go with them? Sure. They were downtown. I would take a cab and meet them there. I came down and went directly with the woman. "I have family here, too and I wanted to go with them..." She looked at me with an annoyed and distrusting face, "oh do you, too?" She used the more formal usted. It wasn't male, but I felt like I were in school again, being addressed as a little boy. "...yeah, they were... in the... with me... I just, would you give me your phone?". She dictated me her numbers and I heard the comments from the guys. "Oh, yeah, now everybody has family" "Yeah, his family just appeared to not be with us" "Yeah, go, don't be with them", she commented me with a lighter mood.

As I walked and exit the eating place, I saw the plate still in my table and everyone's look on me. Did they hate me? Did they comment on how good it was that I left? I was so weird anyway, I looked like a girl and was so quiet. Maybe I were gay and liked somebody there. Fucking faggot.

I felt the tears in my eyes as I asked for a cab in the reception. It was called for me and drove me there. In the way he told me about this passenger he got. A beautiful young girl who tattooed a spider-web over half of her face. He criticized her and judge her. I just followed his way and felt dirty. Would he judge me, too? Would I be changing permanently my body, mutilating it, just like her? "He was such a handsome boy and destroyed it with estrogen."

I ate with my parents in the same restaurant I went with Catherine once. My mother took several pictures. In one of them, she told my father to capture it in a way that the whole kiosk appeared behind us. "Do you want the picture of that or us [nosotros]?" "Both" she answered while we smiled and looked towards the camera. "[nosotros]..." I hear this right. the rest I don't know. I have no reason to doubt it. There was a silence and then other words. There is nothing else she could had said. "[bueno, es nosotras]".

I hiperventilated and felt my heart race. No, you did not say that. I heard wrong. I felt just like I did with the words of the Karaoke. It wasn't the pressures of the other woman just like it wasn't then the sights and comments and the auditorium. It was being addressed in the feminine. Not knowing if it was real. Distrusting my perception. That was the reason I texted Catherine and felt my eyes water again.

A couple of times while we walked and shopped around, people called me in the feminine way, or used the plural female with my mom and me.

We saw some places and took some pictures. My dad ordered an uber which took me to the hotel. There were some other students in the lobby who saw me as I stepped down from the car. I heard some of their words. "Well, yeah, but they did said we could each go our own ways."

I went to my room to charge my phone. Sixto was already asleep. I came outside to the living room. I stayed there a while and though about buying something in the vending machine downstairs. A soda, something. I walked down. There was this man in a white shirt and suspenders giving a file to somebody. He asked me if I knew him. No. It was forgotten there. He would see him today that we return.

I was planning on asking if the sodas costed something or if I could just take one, when the guy turned to me and asked me if I was from UABC, too. What did I study. Mexicali or Tijuana. Did I go somewhere, had I been there before. Oh, they were just downtown, too.

"What are you gonna do now?... We are going for a little beer, do you want to come?"

Oh, no, I'm fine, thank you, you go and have fun, it was nice meeting you. "uh, yeah, sure".

I even left my phone in my room. They were the three Law majors from Tijuana. Him and his girlfriend, other lawyers, too. And me, the psychologist who looked like a girl.

Why was he so nice? We walked a couple of blocks and entered a wings place. One ordered nuggets and the girl wings. He and I each asked for french fries. We all ordered the 5 liter thing. Dark beer. Was it Indio? It was good.

I drank, faster than most. Maybe more, too. It seemed like it. I felt my tongue being loosened. I felt just like Spain, drowning my gender dysphoria in alcohol. Digging and hole and hiding it there. I talked more, opened up. It was different to the first couple of minutes that I felt invited out of pity, ignored and invisible. Like a lost dog kept under the table for giving him what is dropped.

We returned and went to one of their rooms. I wasn't really invited, but it wasn't as awkward as I thought it would be entering.

We kept talking, asking questions. Listening to music. By the end of it, it was almost one o'clock. We talked about his thesis on the gender quota. How it is still gender discrimination trying to fill a quota on gender. At first I felt passionately about the theme, I wanted to talked about it, being heard, understood. Then I realized it was still a delicate subject and what was in the alcohol grave resurfaced. It didn't hurt but it wasn't repressed anymore.

"I don't care if you are a man, or a woman, or a chimera" almost everyone laughed, "or an alien. It's about what you can do."

I am trans. I am one of those chimeras. They don't know. Would they had invited me anyway? Would I be standing here drinking with them? Am I really this different?

He talked about going to Tijuana in September and visiting some friends. "Add him so he knows and goes, too". He invited me. I was taken in count. I fitted in.

But at what price? How would I look in september? Would they really add me on Facebook? Would they note the post I was supposed to write?

Today in the breakfast Hilda touched my shoulder and said "today you didn't sent us a message". They didn't spend the day together as I had assumed. Ana went to her family and Hilda to her friends.

In lunch, everything from the salad to the dessert was not served to me. Ranch and cheese in the salad. Mushroom cream for the soup. Pasta carbonara as the main plate (pasta with eggs, bacon, cream and cheese). And for dessert, a creamy mousse.

I was anxious about leaving. My parents were already in the airport. The white haired woman was still unseen. It was 2 o'clock and we hadn't even left the room. The check out time was noon with an hour of consideration.

Hilda and Ana were the last one to come to the bus. I sent her a message but it was unseen.

In the airport, it felt a little different than when we first went. The tickets were not printed.

I bought a ham sub to fill my stomach. I bought a bracelet to Anahi and a little bottle of coffee liquor to Catherine and me. When we landed, the little kid in front of me that didn't stayed calm the whole flight wanted to exit first. Her mother tried to keep him quiet. In a possible outburst he threw the water bottle and tried to step on it. It was taken from under his foot. He threw another step almost upon my own shoe.

The mother told him "If you step on her, she will scold you". I smiled to him. I smiled for myself.

My parents were asked if they were just the two of them. They were offered moving to one of the emergency exits. My parent answered "yes, no, we're three, we're with Him" and pointed at me. The stewardess looked at me. They were not moved.

I forgot the black sweater in my uncles' house. I decided not to return. It's the most feminine male piece of clothing I own. I will miss it.

I don't know what I'll do tomorrow. Or wear.

## 2016-06-01

I've been sitting here for several minutes and I haven't started the words until just now.

The app of the Michigan's DNA study showed me that they have received the spit kit already. In two or three months I'll now if my sample contained enough DNA data to be analyzed.

I slept this morning like I did not in Guadalajara. I dreamed a lot. Three alarms I postponed before the phone rang I heard my mom's voice from the speaker telling me how she had forgotten her phone with all her alarms. At what time would I leave from home? Could I take it to her?

Sure.

Yesterday Rene sent me a text message asking me if he could see me earlier. I accepted. Yesterday, also, I set up plans with Catherine about going out. Would I wear a dress? I could wear the hoses we bought. I planned wearing something less feminine and then changing into it. My mother's call changed all my plans. I could not anymore. I would have to enter into her school and being seen by her work mates, people who know me. I would be Laurita's son.

I went to shower and shave my chest and pits, and my legs. I put on my underwear and over it the clothes in which I slept. I shaved my face and covered the little cuts with stinging alum. I came down shirtless and put on the red long-sleeved t-shirt. I put both the cream and mousse on my hair. I put on the tights, too, and the black jeans over them.

I applied some make up to hide the beard shadow. Until then I left for therapy. It was 11:20. I was late. I got into the car and remembered how I had forgotten my mother's phone. I returned for it and drove out again. I forgot the control of the fence, so I came once again.

I drove to the kinder. I got in there and received smiles from the people who recognized me. I knocked into the door of my mom's classroom. Some of her kids noticed me and called her: "teacher, your son".

I looked "fine". I was seen as a boy. I handed her the phone and went out on my way. I crossed the street and drove to therapy. I parked in the close parking lot. It's more expensive. I got one or two minutes before the session time. I was welcomed by the feminine. I walked and used the stairs.

I didn't stop talking in the whole session. Does it work if I don't get any interpretations?

 When I exited I sent Catherine a text and returned to my car. I finished my make up and put on the dress I had in the bag with the laptop. She got into the car and put hers. She lend me the lipstick Vania gave her. She noted how my tire was low. We stopped in the gas station and asked for it to be filled with air.

I drove her to argana. Or was she the one who drove? No, I drove us to playas. We got to Argana and entered. There was only the oldest waitress. She recognized us. I realized when we sat and she asked us if we were "listos" to order. It hurt even more than ever. I was wearing a dress and had make up.

I took the laptop but Catherine didn't save the episode in her usb. It didn't pass correctly. I downloaded another one. We ate and saw it. She repeated the male adjective when Catherine paid. She didn't give us our teas and yet was going to charge us. She offered to drive me. We went to La creperia like the week before. We ordered a latte and a chai. The chai one was so sweet and creamy I didn't like it. Everything was going awfully. We exchanged the beverages and left.

We stopped in the sex shop to buy lubrication. There was a cop with another person and a dog. "A little killer" she called it. When we walked to the store, he let loose little by little the dog. He came to me and I stopped. The dog sniffed me and climbed to my leg. He tried hiding its nose under my skirt.

We enter and bought what we were looking for and some water in the oxxo nearby. Three hotels we entered and exited because of the price. The first one was out of cheap rooms. The second one was way more expensive than we imagined. We finally went to the usual one.

In the room we got frisky and started kissing and touching each other. "Do I take my shoes off?" I was playful and I asked to separate her legs. I tried kicking it off and sending it to the other side of the room. I kicked it and my flat flew out of the window. We both heard the sound of leaves.

I stepped down looking for it. I mistook the bushes. A cab stopped thinking about picking me up. I finally found it and got it back.

We had sex. We talked.

"Are you ashamed of me?"

I hurt her. She had thunk about it, too, last week with Anahi's comment. She can't say she supports me if she's not able to tell her parents.

## 2016-06-02

I had a patient again. I didn't shave. I showered and combed my hair. I didn't use mousse.

I woke up later than usual. Again I almost forgot to take the pills. My grandma made me two burritos of egg and chorizo. They were warmly wrapped in the table when I exited my room. She was making Miguel something different. After I walked into the kitchen she offered me some of it or to make me some, too. I accepted.

I ate the breakfast with an english muffin. She offered me tortillas and I declined. I ate them anyway.

Today I finally finished the Snow Crash book. I didn't really like it. I'm glad it's finish. I asked Catherine which of the two books I had waiting to start. She said "American Gods".

I was still in my pajamas when Miguel showered and asked me to give him a ride to the gym. I did. I am a good sibling. Could I had use the opportunity to tell him about me? How do you even start that conversation? Is that why I thought about asking Hilda? "Hey, uh, did I look like a girl in Jalisco?".

There are just three boxes filled with pills in my organizer. I have to buy hormones. Literally hormones. I have still some antiandrogens for the time until my next prescription. I am lacking estrogen and antibaby pills. Will I dare to show my mother the prescription?

She doesn't know I am taking hormones. She knows about the testosterone blockers. She knows I want to stop looking like a man. Does she gets that I want to look like a woman? That I am experimenting changes now.

Do people notice?

I picked him up again in the afternoon. Three trips I made to the River zone. After bringing him back, I saw the episode of Steven Universe. In it, Garnet, the fusion of the lesbian couple gets separated because of plot reasons. Ruby, tries to infiltrate the Ruby squad that comes to earth. They find the rest of the gang and get into a play of baseball. The plot of a kids show does looks silly and nonsensical.

They say the names of the members of the team. Little changes go into each one. Steven stays the same. Pearl becomes Earl; Amethyst, Amy; Lapis gets the illogical Bob. Sapphire becomes Sophie.

I felt this weird feeling inside of me. I don't get why. I picked the name. I chose it. It wasn't given to me, it hasn't accompanied me my whole life. I didn't start understanding the idea of the self when my mother kept calling me by that word.

I was Ivan. They called me Ivan. I have the memories of hearing that name by my mother's voice even before I could speak.

Catherine sent me some of her pictures of her in kindergarten and grade school. I saw her growing each year, changing, becoming a teenager. The similarities between the little child and the woman I love. I will never get that. I will never have been a girl. It doesn't matter how much I change, mentally, physically, my past will always stay the same. I will always had suffered and cried and felt ashamed. I will always had been that quiet shy little boy.

Little sad Ivan, why don't you like to sing like the rest of the children? Little sad Ivan, why do you feel empty inside?
Every day you await for the days like your birthday or Christmas when you know it's time to smile. You get all you wished for and you do smile and in an instant it dissipates like the light of the candles in your cake, like the lights in the Christmas tree. And in smoke you stop smiling again, and you feel the same. Year by year, even though there are more candles, the light is dimmer.

Until there is none. There is no more waiting. There are no more smiles.

Little sad Ivan, I want to hug you. I want to be in front of you and dry your tears. I want to embrace you and tell you everything will be alright.

I know you won't believe me. You won't recognize me. You won't trust me. You'll come anyway, and you will hug me and you will cry even though you don't like people seeing you hurt.

And I'll look into your eyes and in the softest and most caring voice I will tell you it's not your fault. You've done nothing wrong. I don't blame you at all. You've done everything you could. This pain will fade.

Time will pass and you'll stop being little. Then you will stop being sad. Finally, you will be Ivan no more, and the light will bright again.

## 2016-06-03

I paid in Gusher a little less than 200 pesos for 28 pills of antidepressants. A supply that lasts me 2 weeks. I told my mother a couple weeks ago about looking at the prices of the medication in the pharmacy of Costco. Those weeks I would be going out in the evenings so there was no point in asking of going. I wanted to make use of the opportunity. I could ask them, show them the prescriptions, telling them that I'm taking those medications, letting them pay for them.

I was scared. Even now that it already passed I am a little nervous.

My grandma asked me to go to the oxxo to buy eggs, milk and tortillas. I would go out this afternoon so I'd be going before leaving. Miguel got up and they asked me. I had already gotten out of the shower. Did I have make up already? I wore the third new shirt and a bra underneath.

Nobody asked me or told me anything in the feminine form. I do notice more smiles, certain kind of looks. I know most of them are in my mind.

I went to put gasoline. The dispatcher welcomed me in the masculine form. After putting one hundred pesos worth of it, he told me how my tire was low, I should put some air in it. I gave a U-turn and stopped in the tire shop. I waited outside the car after a man in a black t-shirt approached me in my window and asked me what would I be needing. I waited a quarter of an hour. There were just two technicians and both were busy. Three times someone approached and asked me in a masculine way if I had been attended. I was wearing shades. Almost all of my clothes were man's. I was supposed to go to Catherine's house and look like a man. "Boy-mode" how they use to call it in reddit.

They use to say how when they started failing it is a signal of going full time. That use to happen months after starting hormones. I am just a little over a month in a minimal dosage. My breasts have grown. They are noticeable now. Catherine told me how in some of the pictures of Guadalajara my chest looked like that of a teenage girl.

I drove towards Catherine house. I had this blue feeling. I felt invisible and hideous. Like a tiny stinking black dot.

In her house we climbed the stairs to her old room. I was supposed to help her clean it. There were piles of stuff and clothes around it. She sat to put some shoe boxes inside the cabinet of her room. I tried some of hers. I looked into the pile of clothes she had thought about throwing away. I had this painful feeling of envy. She has clothes to throw and sell and give away. I have just a handful. I can't buy more. I don't dare to ask my parents for help.

I ate one of the breads I bought after coming home from my patients. I didn't eat again until returning from the Costco.

We went down to Catherine's living room. I interpreted the questionnaires I applied to my patient yesterday. We chatted and I helped her some with hers of the MMPI.

Her parents left to eat. They offered us to go or bring something. We stayed. We hugged and took some pictures. I kissed her. And we kept kissing until we were lying in the couch. Moments later we were in her bed, almost naked, wearing nothing but our bras. We lied besides each other with a hand between the other's legs. She came first. She hugged me and whispered my name in my ear until I came, too.

When I got home, my mother was already here. She was chatting with my grandma. Luis was asleep. He seems tired and depressed. He cried when they took him to cut his hair.

My mother told me what happened after I left from her classroom. I stayed with the idea of them seeing me, and knowing me as "the teacher's son". I didn't speak, that's how they looked me, that's how they told her. Did they know I would be coming? Were they expecting me? She explained how "that young man who just came is my son...".

Some things happen after that I just now know. One of them whispered to the boy besides him: "the teacher's son looks like a girl". He ratted him to my mom. She asked the first kid why he said something like that, expecting to hear something about the hair. "It's because his lips are red, like he just painted his mouth".

They weren't. I did put make up on. I was wearing foundation, but nothin else. I had a bra under my shirt. But my lips were normal. They kept discussing about my hair, why would my mother let me wear it long, why doesn't she force me to cut it.

She supported me. I am an adult. I make my own choices. I guess that's not as much support as I had thunk.

I went to Costco and asked about the prices of the antidepressants. They're a little more than a tenth of the price I pay in the pharmacy. When I gave him the second prescription my mother asked me what were those. I answered vaguely how it was the medication from the endocrinologist. He came back with the Diane and told me that they don't dispense Estrogens.

Tomorrow we'll go to the United States.



## 2016-06-04

I started reading again. I am almost by the fifth chapter in a novel of 20. This book is lots better than the last two I've read. This is less science-fiction-y. I'm glad I didn't start reading the back cover with the synopsis. I knew nothing about it besides that the protagonist was called Shadow. He was in prison for 3 years, he described his wife and anxiety about leaving. That known feeling I've experienced of knowing something wrong is going to happen. I read how he was called to the main office three days before his leaving. I read when they gave him the news about his wife's death.

I felt sad, I was shocked. I gasped and took my hand to my mouth.

We went to the United States. My grandma decided to go, too. She put her knee-thingy. We crossed in the normal lane. Instead of the 15 minutos to half hour we usually make, we did a little more than half hour. I wore a red t-shirt and jeans. I took a gray light jacket with me, but took it off before crossing. I think it's still in the car.

My parents left in the morning to go to the bank. I told Catherine last night how we were going to be leaving in the early morning. She was there even before I got up from bed. She was already back when we left home. She brought me a Mickey blouse. Some friend of her mother gave her a bag full of clothes for her to sell whenever she goes to the swap meet. She sent me three pictures of her in different dresses.

Until now I hadn't remembered that other time when Monica sent me three similar pictures. How many years have passed since then? I did think about Monica today. No, it was first about Johanna. Catherine understood how would be feeling sad. Do I remember her because of the times she tells me about Carlos?

Anahi started a conversation with me today. She asked me how it went my trip. Haven't I seen her since my departure?

I'm tired. Yesterday I tried doing the exercises again. I didn't finish them all. They were push ups. I couldn't I get tired. I am losing my strength.

I am glad of noting those effects, even if their mostly because of a placebo effect. Yesterday I bought the pills in Costco. Today I didn't stop in the pharmacy. Tomorrow will be elections day, so I guess I'll shower anyway. I can go after or before. Will they tell me something because of my id? No, they shouldn't. I hope they do.

We stopped in the Denny's. I ordered the fish fillet. Back home, before leaving, I took my pills in front of Luis. I want him to tell me something, I want him to start the conversation. My mother asked me yesterday and I deviated. "It's what the endocrinologist gave me". The pharmacist answered her for me. "We don't have estrogens".

She didn't see the prescription nor my name on it. Why does it make me uncomfortable? So what, yes, I chose a feminine name. I picked it myself. Where from? I don't know. It just came to me. It was the first one in which I felt comfortable. That's not really true, though. The first times that everyone used it, were awkward as hell. I don't believe them. How will I feel when I hear it through their voice?

Why can't I imagine being addressed as their daughter, their sister.

Why is it so much easier imagining going somewhere far away.

Luis confessed to my grandma how he felt sad when I was in Spain. I was so far away, all alone. How did I do that? Would I be able to do it again? I guess I will. I will in less than a year if everything goes according to plan. Sure it will be closer, but it will be harder, too. I went as a male. I will go as a trans woman.

The point is that Luis cares about me, he loves me and admires me. He was irritated and upset with everyone. Later that day, when I approached him and talked to him, he was calmer and easier going. What will happen when he knows I am trans? When he knows what happens with me and why I go to this doctor and take this medication.

He worries about me.

Will he worry, will he love me as much still?

## 2016-06-05

Why is it harder now to keep with my streaks? It's twice as hard to do the exercises. I'm tired of typing and thinking about what to write.
Today were elections. Miguel woke up early in the morning and I heard his steps and the words he exchanged with my grandmother. Yesterday, before I went to sleep, I saw the clothes I had put in the washing machine moved to the drying machine. Somebody moved them. Who was it, Miguel or my grandma? I thought about one of them taking them out now in the morning. Early today I remembered but was so tired that I stayed in bed. Later in the morning, when I checked, the clothes stayed there.

Was it then really? Or did I move them last night and put them in this very chair I am sitting right now?

I'm wearing the deadpool pajamas I bought before going to Guadalajara. Almost the 8 weeks since I went to the endocrinologist have passed, why does the anxiety of the doses have come back?

Miguel was in the same high school I was a year ago. My father brought us breakfast to Luis and me.

I was chatting with Catherine and asked her to wait for me a little. I am getting the blues.

She came. We talked yesterday about doing something. I wanted to go out. I needed to go to the pharmacy today. I took the last of the 42 pills of estrogen. 42 days and 4 of rest. 46 days taking hormones. Almost half of a hundred.

I showered and shaved. I was supposed to go to vote anyway. After that I could drive myself to the pharmacy and buy the last box of pills. My dad's pick up was parked behind the cars. I should wait for him or ask him. "Why are you going?" He would ask.

I was nervous. I should be able to talk freely to them about the medications and its effects. Sure, I told them months ago, but what's the point if I'm still hiding? I am everything but free.

We went to vote. I did, I checked the little ballot they gave me with the information I heard from the lawyers in Guadalajara. I have no opinion. I don't plan on staying here. I know who will win anyway. Everything will stay the same.

Before leaving home I said if we could make a stop in the pharmacy. "What do you need?" my father asked as I had imagined, looking straight at me from the rearview mirror. "I have to buy the medication they didn't have in Costco" My mother did a gesture of "oh, yeah, right". He kept asking, what medication? I freaked. I had thunk about this. I had cold feet and said the truth covered and disguised in technicalities. Hormones, estrogen. I could had said. He would had understood. Maybe it would had ended right there. Maybe it would be the start of a much needed conversation. "Gonadotropins" I answered lying with the truth. "What are those for?", he continued. "They're for my endocrine system." That one was true, also.

Had my mother heard about the estrogen in Costco? Did she say something to him? Did she understand the relationship about my words and the technical terms they teach you in high school biology?

I thought about their reactions in the pharmacy. It is different the faces they make when I buy the antidepressants and the ones they give me when I show them the other prescription. Do they know it;s me? Do they realize what is my treatment? Are they uncomfortable?

Catherine came home and we watched the episode of game of thrones. I offered her one of the birria tacos that were left. She accepted and we ate them with Luis sharing the table with us.

Why did I think about Monica today? "My ex", I remember using those words. What was it? Yeah. Catherine told me how she's a little unnerved by the lot of stuff I have over my bookshelf. She wants to clean it. I haven't touched there since Ieft to Spain. The things there, there is something right there that scares me. I have the ikea boxes I bought still wrapped. I don't want to go near there and move. I told her about how I still had the picture frame with "my ex". There is the tube of gifts she gave me, too. Somewhere is the box of stuff I should had thrown out long ago.

I asked her, when I was mad as hell, suspecting she had regifted the last present I gave her. I asked her about it the first time I relapsed from our long silences. She told me she had it with all of the rest of the stuff I had given her. Of course she opened it and read it.

I wasn't relieved. I wasn't angry either. It was something else entirely. I remembered one of the other times we broke up and she told me she had seen that same bunch of stuff and remembered how we were. She missed it and had realized the huge mistake it was to had broken up.

Is that what scares me? That I'll move there and stuff will come, her presents and notes and letters. Will I miss her? I know I didn't make a mistake.

I didn't talk about that with Catherine. No. It was something else. I want to leave her. I want to move out somewhere else where there won't be no more things from my past but the ones I brought there. No memories to hunt me. No buried things from past lives.

I am resigned of never being truly free here. They know, both of my parents know about me. Luis and Miguel might know, too, soon enough. But will that change anything? Will they accept it and change their idea of me as I do? Or will they also be like the memories from the distant past that will haunt me forever?

## 2016-06-06

I came to start the words. There was a 1 in parenthesis next to the Facebook tap in the browser. I clicked it thinking it was my male profile. I was wrong. The notification wasn't a text message or an advice of something new in the wall. It was a new friend request. Orozko Consultoria, the Human Resources professor. He added me. Was it a notification of "you might know this person"? Maybe he didn't recognize me and just added me because I was maybe another of his students. Maybe he did know. The picture is there and clear as day. Am I nervous? I added him, accepted him.

I woke up with a void in my stomach. Like a black hole, there was something inside of my that sucked every little bit of energy and motivation. I stayed in bed watching Freaks and Geeks in the tablet. I did the exercise until just a couple of hours ago. Time keeps passing by. Today is 6th of June. In ten days I'll be seeing the endocrinlogist. In a week I'll be getting up early in the morning, fasting and wearing girl's clothes to the lab to get my blood drawn. I did shower today. I shaved my legs. They're sore and burning.

Tomorrow I'll see both Catherine and Anahi. The day after tomorrow I'll see Rene, and the day after that, my patient. Saturday my parents will go to Mexicali and I'll ask to stay here. What will they say? I was invited to see my friends from the university. It'll be Paola's birthday.

I have a reason, several of them. They're valid.

Tomorrow I will wear jeggings. I will wear one of the tank tops and a hoodie. Why am I feeling like this? It's like a half-try.

Like if I'll fail. We will go to the beach. Why do I keep thinking I will be seen as a feminine man? I am a woman, in pajama, in a suit, in a dress or naked, I'm the same person.

Why do I feel like I have to dress the part? I can wear whatever the fuck I want.

I saw the parts of my room Catherine talked about yesterday. I actually considered doing something, grabbing a bag, throwing things, getting everything from there to the floor. Starting. Making a change.

I moved the paracords I bought months or maybe even years ago. I did a monkey fist bookmark. I used the remaining yellow cord to make a bracelet.

Catherine saw a blouse/dress in Plaza Rio and sent me a picture saying she thought of me.

She saw her patient today. I stayed in bed and ate and lied again, and went back to eat and shat and finally found the energy to do the exercises.

What is it that brings me down? 8 weeks have passes and I worry about the fucking doses again. I'll see him in a little more than a week. I can tell him then, ask him. I don't even have the lab results. The first weeks every start in a low dosage.

I answered a survey about LGBT people and relationships and mental health.

When I was looking for marbles to do the cord thingy, I found four of my old spintops. Before my dad and my mom came home, I looked for the keys of the backyard and play with two of them. I remember how to make them dance. I never actually really know how. It was a try and sometimes success kind of thing. I hadn't played with something like that in more than ten years. I was in elementary school. How easier where times then?

I remember being in kindergarten. Just learning how to write. I was given homework about copying a story to my notebook. It was late at night and it was several pages long. I remember feeling beaten, how would I finish such a thing? It was way too much.

15 years later I would spent full nights working in projects to give the next morning.

I cried and felt sad because of what Xennia did or didn't do. I liked her. I had a childish crush on her.

10 years later would I really know how love can hurt you. The ways it can make you feel alive and actually wish you were dead.

10 years ago I was taught the changes my body would go through, and told how it might be shocking and hard.
Now I am going through puberty again.

I am mending a mistake.

But whose?

## 2016-06-07

I'll start the words early today. It's a little after noon. I was supposed to go out today. I am changed and showered but still home. I know Miguel showered, too, and he might be in the living room waiting for me to go out and ask me if I can give him a ride to the gym. Why am I irritated? It wouldn't change a thing. I am going downtown anyway, the gym is on my way there. I would not deviate at all. It's not like last time that I went and picked him up, doing four trips that I hadn't needed to do.

I woke up early in the morning by several different dreams. The first one of them, the one I remember most and actually recalled in the subsequent dreams had Monica in it. Not her, technically, but her text. It was like when I was just beginning to know her. I knew more about her than most people and I hadn't even heard her voice. She did not appear in my dream. I did not see her, I did not hear her. I received a text message from her. The content is now fussy. I know she was asking me about something, how have I been holding up, she is sorry that we haven't talked and the way things were left. It was nice hearing about her, knowing something. Certain kind of closure.

I woke up to another dream and realized my phone was empty. No notifications, nothing. Everything was still the same.

In this dream I told Catherine I was sick. I might had been. But there was something else. I had shat. Not myself, I'm not sure. I went to the bathroom but there were no lights or water. The toilet was out of service. I was staying in my parents bedroom. I used the toilet but could not clean myself. I needed help. My mother came and helped me, except not in that way. She "cleaned me" but it was different. I had this sensation of being soiled, unclean. Maybe that's were the idea of being sick comes. I was handicapped and polluted. She made me kneel and with a bucket of water under me put something in my hair. Was it shampoo or soap? It was blue and thick. It came to my face and nostrils. It didn't rinse. I was drowning. I couldn't breathe and felt dirty still.

That dream changed and I was in a kind of theater. It was a show, like a play. Everyone was dressed fancy. I remember the seats were normal chairs. There were lots of them facing a big scenery. I recall seeing Jessica and Eusebio. He was wearing a suit or a tuxedo. I was walking and saw one waiter filling glasses with ginger ale. I asked for one and showed him. What was I wearing? Was I dressed in a masculine or feminine way? I don't remember feeling nervous or uncomfortable. I know I looked. I didn't avoid it. Chevo saw me and asked for one but was told there were no more. I gave him mine.

We sat and chatted. There was a news, was it a newspaper? My father was reading it. It might had been his phone. He showed me, or was it to us? A high number of car accidents in the city.

The dream changed. It might had been the stories everybody was sharing but I was in them. I walked through the city. It might had been the highway. I remember walking through a park, something like that. There were wrecked cars in the middle of the street. Stopped, without figure, painted with blood. The cars keep driving, crashing with them. Lots of heavy machinery slipping, flying, coming down with full force.

 I was scared. A semi was rolling my way and I kept walking. I thought I could go the other way in time. I didn't. It came and almost crushed me.

I woke up a little later.

My grandma said she made me some "burritos". I am still irritated. I told her I didn't want them. I spoke my mind to Catherine. I hate how she offers us food. I hate being here, living here.

I fried myself an egg and heated some of the food of yesterday. I took the pills but feel no effect whatsoever. Even from the usual dose of antidepressants. I haven't taken the new medication.

"How are you?" Catherine just asked.

I'm sad and disappointed. I'm tired and sick. I'm dirty. I'm walking through a wreck. I'm crushed.

## 2016-06-08

"It's Ivan, did he change sex? And all those times I was passive?" He joked. I told Catherine about the phone and my voice. "I don't know what to do or say" and then she sent me the screencap of the incoming messages she was receiving.

I knew since the beginning something like this could happen. I get the profile picture several times in the "you might now this person" section.

I woke up from dreams. I can't remember them. I know it was hard to sleep. Oh yeah. Last night a little before midnight my was in the dinning room with her laptop or ipad doing some work. She had her headphones on while she was busy. I wouldn't had mind except for the fact she was singing. It was a weird guttural whispering that was like a drowned scream. I was in my bed covered in the sheet. I used the other pillow to muffle the sounds that passed even through the door.

I thought about going outside and asking her to be quiet. I was trying to sleep. Why didn't I do it?

I instead grabbed the earphones from my bag and plugged them to my phone. I heard the music while I tried to sleep again.

Garab answered. After talking a little about what could she say or what would happen later, she sent him the message. I didn't change sex but I indeed was trans. He could talk to me directly.

He was playing around. He saw the picture and thought it was the profile of a girl that just looked incredibly like me. He wanted to cause her a funny moment.

I was nervous and scared. I was fucking terrified. He didn't know. He saw the picture, he noticed the similarities. He didn't know anyway.
He thought I was a girl who looked just like Ivan.

Sure, Catherine disclosed to him my situation for nothing and the only thing I could think about was how I passed.

Both Yarely and Miguel accepted my friends' request. Yarely liked my other picture.

Did I fall asleep? It was one or two in the morning when my mother came down. The door was open. I left it that way after returning from the restroom. She stepped down with the phone. She was talking with somebody. Was it the psychologist from her school? I heard half of the conversation and was irritated. I tried covering my ears. I can't remember what happened.

I just know I woke up in the morning and made myself a sandwich of chicken salad and took my pills.

I can't get over Garab's situation. He was the first person I met in the university. He was the first friend I made. I considered posting the "coming out" post to the university people just because of what happened. There is no point now, for now. There is a point still, there is no rush, though.

He reacted fine. He is happy for me. "While he (or is it she?) is happy."

Why do I have this sour taste in my mouth?

I ... I don't know.

Yesterday I wrote the words before leaving. Miguel was waiting for me. He told my grandma how he was waiting for me to leave the room so he could ask me for a ride.

I took him to the gym. I drove to the plaza of the restaurant. I wandered through the supermarket until their arrival. I bought a packet of cookies. In the restaurant we were welcome in the masculine form. The waitress who took us to our table welcomed us first neutrally, then femininely and later neutrally again, correcting herself. It was like a sucker punch in my by then sensible state of mind.

The thought of adding Monica on Facebook crossed my mind. I was the one who deleted her. She is the only contact I would add in the new profile that has both my mother and brothers.

So what? What would be the expecting outcome? Would it be better for her to ignore me or actually accepting me? Is the silence mine? Am I again the one avoiding her? I was the last one to contact her. She was the one to send me away.

The wrap I ordered came with cheese in it. I took it off with the fork but by the time I wanted to roll it up again it was a mess.

I cried there in the table.

The rest of the evening was alright. In the cafe de la flor where we went for a crepe, the waiter received us as ladies. And he even called me directly when took my plate.

I talked about that in session. Rene asked me about the medication, the doses, do I notice a change? He might be thinking about lowering the dosage. I don't mind. Now they're cheap as hell.



## 2016-06-09

I saw the patient again. I have hiccups. Twice since I started typing. The third time hasn't come. I returned from the restroom. My phimosis is still there. Is there a point in going and getting it fixed? I hadn't really given it any thought. Once I saw it mentioned in reddit. Trans women who preferred it so they would not see their glans exposed. Would it be different for me to see it that different way? Rene was the one who mentioned it months ago. It was kind of a big clitoris always covered. I remember the shock and surprise when one of those first times using the condom and penetrating and I took it off and saw the glans exposed. Yeah I attributed the discomfort to the extra sensitivity, but I was scared even before it touched my thigh.

I don't really understand how I went from starting about my session with the patient and finishing talking about my penis.

I won't see her again until after I see the gang in the park and go to the lab and see the endocrinologist. I have a whole week until giving her the last two or three tests.

I haven't started interpreting the other ones. I have three projective tests and two excel spreadsheets answered but a whole un-captured mmpi booklet filled with half a thousand items.

The exercise program of the app is finished. 8 weeks have passed, 56 days. A week before I started hormones, a week before meeting him again.

When I was looking for the tests and the manuals, I accommodated the booklet of items from the mmpi in a folder. After moving the pages I saw the green sheet of the order of the blood test. I grabbed a pen and checked the estradiol box. It does looks a little different from the other ones. Should I fill the other data? They will have my card and information from the profile. Am I nervous? I will go Monday. Will my grandma be here then still? They will go to Mexicali in the weekend. They have to give my uncle the last furniture they bought for the kitchen, I guess?

Will I go like a girl even if she's here? Yeah.

Why am I scared and nervous? What is it that I fear?

I'm wearing shorts and my bare legs are exposed. Shaven since the firsts of the week. I remember years ago how I hesitated even to tie my shoelaces. Now I am wearing shorts and nobody bates an eye. Is it better or worse?

I again considered shaving my arms. Catherine told me to wait. It will be more noticeable. I thought about getting my brows trimmed.

Rene repeated about my fractured identity. I talk about clothes, separating them in "full male, ambiguous, feminine". I am still the same person underneath.

I should start the new program. Do some exercise, move, force my body, use it. Tire it.

Catherine is on her new diet. Will she lose weight? Will she look thinner and prettier? Will I change, too? Will I look prettier, too, some day?

I had the thought crossed my mind yesterday in session but I blocked it. I kept my mouth shut and saw it fly by.

He said how it's like after an earthquake the books from the bookcase get knocked off. One by one you can start putting them on again. "A month each, maybe, after time they will be all on their place, just like you like them. And even if you don't you can take them all down and start again..."

Yeah, I know there will be waiting and time and all that. The fear I sometimes get is that I won't be here by then. I might look fine in a year or two, feel whole and complete and fulfilled. But what if I die halfway there? What if my time ends in two weeks? Everything would be over. It's possible, the possibility will always be there, and telling me the wait will be long just highs the probabilities of me not reaching it.

Tomorrow will be friday. I will start with the tests. I have to grade the projective ones, after that I can capture the mmpi answers and play with the tables and manual in excel. Look at the scales and see what they show.

Saturday I'll see Catherine. My parents will leave. What if they leave after Catherine gets here? What if they see me?

I can worry about that then, or even tomorrow.

## 2016-06-10

I was already in bed with the turns turned off and the sheets covering me almost to my face. I've read and tried watching netflix. I took Miguel to his school and showered and made exercise and walked to threw the bag of clothes I had in the feet of my bed for months and half of my closet.

Yesterday I wrote about the feelings of dying and I feel death's cold fingers deep well inside of me.

I took the pills after eating the bowl I served myself of cereal. I was fine. I did the exercise and weighted myself. 79 kilos a little more. At first I thought I be getting higher and higher. When I turned them to pounds I realized how that's not really true. I'm just where I was, not higher or lower. 174 pounds more or less.

I drove Miguel to school. I was lying on the couch watching the last episode of Orphan black when he came from upstairs all changed up and ready and sat in the living room. Or was it the dinning table? Almost when the episode was over did he ask me if I could take him there. I was in pajamas, my hair a mess. Today I did not buy a beverage.

It was there when I started feeling bad. In the morning Chevo answered my messages. We exchanged some images, memes. We have this routine were we send each other the more saddest and miserable jokes about depression and killing ourselves. Between that, we rest with some immature and stupid humour. This time I talked a little more and I showed him the screenshot of Catherine's phones with Garab's messages about my doppelgÃ¤nger and change of sex. He received them and saw it but he did not answer.

I was talking with Catherine, I asked her about what could I wear tomorrow. She did not answer. She got the messages, she saw them. It was not my internet nor hers, it said she was online. I was waiting all by myself in the car parked near my old house where I grew up for the first part of my life. That zone filled with memories. And I was all alone, ignored, left.

Yesterday there was an earthquake. It was a mild one, it was short, not more than five seconds. I was still awake. My mother was working in the living room again with her headphones on and her music knocking my door in whispers. I wanted her to shut up, to let me sleep. Be quiet. I could not open my mouth and talk. Why am I like this?

Everything shook and all quieted down.

Then my grandma came down and they talked louder than ever and I did not fall asleep again.

I finally went down a little past two, I guess. I woke up an hour before noon and was in bed ready to sleep before eight in the afternoon.

I feel like crying, this sadness and frustration all bottled up inside of me. I want to talk, to scream it to somebody, anyone. But why can't I? Why can't I let it out?

What am I so afraid of?

Before sleeping I wrote a new draft of what I could post on Facebook. I changed most of the words, there were no thank yous nor apologizing nor explaining.

It was a tad bit shorter. It felt more to the point. I guess I wanted to tell anybody so I screamed it to a pillow, where nobody could hear me. Everything's still the same.

I've thunk about sending Monica a friend request. It's not really about her accepting me. I don't imagine being her friends or even starting to talk again. It's the gesture of sending it. Knowing she will see the profile. I guess I want to be sure and confirm this feeling of rejection.

I wrote a short text of three words and I deleted it before sending it.

"Luis, I'm trans."

I read a stupid news article about a trans activist talking about this law in England that would permit people to sue trans people for rape if they don't disclose their gender history.

I read the comments and they usually didn't bother me anymore. There were not any direct offenses or attacks. It was the subtle messages. What's wrong in not wanting a partner that had a history with a crisis identity. They are straight man who want a straight woman that were born a woman.

How idiotic to think that a man who got surgery to be a woman is a biological woman deserving of privacy. We're less than half a percent of the population, why would we need rights?

It's normal not being wanted. It should be illegal not saying I am trans, damaged, broken.

Who am I to deny them the information that I am less than a person?


I keep having this idea of Catherine being ashamed of me. I thought about telling them and imagine the classic response of them being bigots and they're not the whole world. I should not worry about them.

"And your parents? and you? How won't I feel like trash if you're even scared of telling people about me"

Why do I want to bring her down, too?

There is a myth that misery is less painful when it's shared.

## 2016-06-11

There are lots of pictures in my phone. Some of me alone, other of me besides Catherine, there are a couple of my friends and even others with all of us.

Today I climbed a tree for the first time in my life. I had never done it before. Never knew how.

It was the same park of that day. I narrated it almost a year ago, I guess. It was three years ago. Our last date. Just now I put the song again. Why do I want to remember it? I won't talk about it. I'll talk about today. This new memory.

Yesterday my mother said we would not go to Mexicali after all. They went to the United States. My grandmother would stay here. I wold not be alone in the house when Catherine come to pick me up.

I cried last night. What was it? I was sad and angry and upset and I screamed in a pillow and the tears wet the other one that I did not embrace.

Catherine asked me if I'd be upset if she asked to leave early. I told her I could take my own car. We could drive by ourselves. She could return and I would not depend on her.

It all started because of that. She felt sad and frustrated. There was something wrong inside of her. She hurt me and she regret it. I told her getting a ride was the least of my worries. From there we kept talking.

"I feel sad and angry. I feel frustrated and alone and weak and worthless. I think of when my father told me I was not alone and he got mad and told me to not say it.

"And I get full of rage.

"I'm imprisoned in a cage and I feel hate. How can I say there is nothing wrong if I feel shame? How can I believe I have nothing wrong if I am an embarrasment.

"I read what people think about people like me. They are not just strangers or internet voices. It's reality. It's your family and mine. It's the whole fucking world."

She shared with me how she feels similarly. Not having the courage of telling her parents. Talking about her. Time is running out and my patience is running out, too. She wants to show me that she's not ashamed of me, she's not ashamed of herself.

I confessed how I think I will not be able to go to her wedding.

She asked me about my confinement.

"In the house, my home. In my room. I can't get out of it because I'll be seen. I have to watch out how I show myself, what I wear and when, what I say and what I don't. In Facebook, who sees what and who can notices.
In this body that doesn't change.
To the wedding I can't go in a suit and I can't go in a dress. Everyone will ask you about your boyfriend Ivan, because I'm confined to that fucking role, and months pass and it doesn't end.
I want to get out of here, somewhere nobody knows me and there won't be any memory that ties me to my past.
Somewhere I can feel free.

"You're right. It's not just the hormones. It's been almost half of the year and I look the same and everybody looks at me the same way and everything is exactly the same and I can't anymore.

"I want to run and I want to scream"

"I will break up with Ivan"

"Ivan should had died in Spain"

"You were not ready, Sofi". And I broke down and I did scream. The tears flowed and the pan did, too. And I scream at the pillow but the night heard. And it cried with me.

Luis and my grandma saw me today. I was wearing the flats and had make up and the blouse.

Everyone messed up again, at least once. Jessica and Paola called me Ivan accidentally. Jessica did not notice, Paola did correct herself.

"Sofi, would you let me put make up on you someday?"

I nodded. Of course. There is no shame anymore.

Paola brought her son, Diego. At first he stayed in her arms, with a pacifier in his mouth. In the park we walked, he laughed. Paola made faces to him and he was laughing full of life. Both of them were. I remembered my dream and felt envy.

They talked about their parties of 15 years old. Party or trip, they said.

This time I didn't think about myself. If I would had wanted one even now that I accept myself. No, this time I saw the girl in her white dress taking her pictures and I thought of whispering to Catherine "When we have a daughter, we won't give her a party."

I felt a nod in my throat and a surge of sadness and emptiness that filled me instead.

I'll never have a daugher nor a son. I've never wanted to be a father. I would never be able to.

I'll never be able to be a mother either. I'll never be able to be a parent.

I got my wish, I guess.

## 2016-06-12

Two months ago I was nervous thinking about waking up early and going by myself to the lab to get my blood drawn. Tomorrow I'll wake up again, fasting, to go and get my blood drawn. Tomorrow I'll get the results in the evening, telling me how I am regarding my health. What are the levels of my hormones. Is the estradiol high? low? Where is it located in relation to other people my age, both male and female. Will my Testosterone have lowered? Will it be low enough? Have the antiandrogens made an effect this time?

Will I be seen as Sofia? Will they remember me? Will I be welcomed differently? Better, worse?

Two months ago I made a mistake. I overestimated the way I would be seen. They saw my stubble and saw me through the woman's jeans and t-shirt.

"Patient Fernandez?" "What is your name?"

I changed my voice and they saw me through it. They tried being nice. They were afraid of being rude.

The second time I knew better. I had gone feminine to the endocrinologist. Would he had talked to me differently had I gone manly? He didn't ask me about any real life experience. He saw me, he asked me about my chest. He read the evaluation.

He named the lab orders by Sofia.

I won't put any marks in the sheet this time either. The second I went straight from his consultory. No, that is not true. That's what he asked me to do, but I came home for the card. Had I been wearing man clothes I would had changed them. I would had applied make up again. This time I was recognized but the treatment was a little different. I was referred in the feminine by the phlebotomist. She made some small talk. Again they filled the sheet with the male gender. Was it because of seeing me or because of what said the computer?

Is it easier treating me when I am not ambiguous?

It hurts more being mistaken when I go all the way.

Why did I cry yesterday? I did not. I tried to sleep but I was tired. My body ached and there were music outside. I don't remember the time surrounding when I finally fell. I just opened my eyes from a dream and there were silence. The pain was still there? Is it here now?

I didn't do the exercise today. I skipped yesterday, too, although I went to the park.

"Hi... hers... I don't want to do that to her"

They try. They worry. Why can't I appreciate? Do I have a right still to feeling broken and hurt?

I posted a picture from then in the profile. I hesitated before tagging Catherine. I don't want to pressure her more after the talk of lasts nights. I doubt there will be a change soon.

Luis will wear make up tomorrow. He asked my mom what can take it away. There will be an activity in his school. He wanted to take it off as soon as it's over. Should I feel relieved?

I would had felt uncomfortable, too, but in an extreme way. I would not do the activity. I wouldn't had to fake, I would really felt sick. What would it had been what troubled me? Would it be liking it? Confronting my own feelings? Letting it show?

I would had thought about my mother's jokes. The comments and teasing. I may had liked it, but their teasing would had broken me. I'd feel ashamed.

Is that the same reason I have both the dress and the pair of jeans for putting on tomorrow?

Luis will leave with my father. Miguel, him and my father will leave a little after 7 in the morning. I don't know the time my mother will be departing. Will she see me? Would I let myself be seen by her?

I could explain it. I will go to the lab and I have both the orders and the patient card by this different name. It's uncomfortable looking like a boy when they ask for Sofia, even though the file says I'm male. Whatever I do, however I look, I'm trapped in a contradiction. At least this way is a secret that just me and they know.

There was a shooting yesterday, this morning. Orlando. A gay bar. 50 people are dead by it and more than 50 were injured.

John Oliver talked a little before his show about it. He didn't name the shooter. He showed the line outside a blood bank of all the people going to donate. I would had gone. I who is terrified of needles and blood. I would had given mine.

I almost cried. Even writing now my eyes are watering again. People care. People support.

I am one of the even fewer, the more alienated. Would people make lines for me, too?



## 2016-06-13

I saw you today. I realize now I'm still scared of you. I see your ghost several times each month. Sometimes when I'm driving, I turn towards the empty seat and you're there, like you used to; others I imagine you signing in and a little pop up with a notification of a new message next to the picture of you. In the morning, driving from the lab to pick Catherine, my girlfriend, I passed next to your house. For a moment I thought what would be like seeing you in your patio doing something, being seen by you. Knowing you recognized my car and saw me in a dress. I picked Cath up and went on with my day. Several things happened that you would not care. You don't care about my life, my worries and fears. It's ok. You're no longer my girlfriend. You are not even my friend anymore.

After everything I was going to end the day leaving her home. I didn't want to. I like being with her, I enjoy her company. I feel loved and cared for. I thought about going for ice cream. For a minute I forgot the surroundings. I forgot about high school, I forgot about the closeness of your home, I thought about finding someone but I honestly forgot about you. In that moment, neither you nor your phantom existed. I was free.

And then I saw him. Someone from my past. The short hair and stature, unkept beard. Why would Moncayo be there, would he recognize me? I remembered the the short movies, the recording sessions. Valeria, Roger. You. "We have to go" a screamed came to my head when I saw your hair. I did not see you still. I don't remember your face. I hadn't seen his either. He wasn't from my past, he was from your future. The scream found its way through my mouth. I had a kind of fight with Catherine because of you. She has this idea that I haven't gotten over you. I'm almost half of my words of the day writing something you will never read, so maybe she's onto something.

She's wrong, though. I am not scared of you because I still love you. I can't understand how I miss you if I feel this much hate. You represent what I fear. Every time I remember something about you, a good memory, a gesture, a gift, it all comes back. Loved ones will leave me. Loved ones will judge me. Nobody is exempt from hate.

You made me face something I hate about me, too. Why am I so ashamed? I fear the conversations you might have with your boyfriend about me, the questions, the mocking, the laughing. Would it hurt me more to know you don't even think of me? Had you turned would you had recognized me? Would it be because of my changes or because of you forgetting me?

I should not care. I should not run away. I should just leave it behind.



I wore a dress to the lab. I didn't wore it from home. I changed in my car parked in front of the house. I was seen as a girl. The sheet that was printed when they drew my blood said masculine still. I wasn't expecting anything else.

I picked up Catherine and drove her to the gyn. Why hadn't she take a pregnancy test? It should had been the first thing. I am her boyfriend. Sex with me, a male, will turn up in a baby.

We ate breakfast in a familiar but new place. I ate the usual and drank coffee. We drove to make an appointment for an ultrasound. We stopped in the beach. We watched game of thrones in that coffee place from our past.

Before all that we were in Cecut. We bought balloons for Miguel, today's his birthday. Walking there she thought she saw Laura a friend of Hilda's. Then Garab was across the street. I felt a rush of coldness stiffen my back. I wanted to turn and turn invisible just like when the nana from my mother's kinder appeared in the lab. Just like later would I run from a place of my past after seeing someone from it.

A man in a bike harassed us. I looked feminine enough to be catcalled.

After crying from the realization that I am not over my feel of shame we stopped in a park from Catherine's past. We talked and played. We laughed. We found a little dog and gave him shadow to rest.

She's not pregnant. She has tumors. Just like her mom. There is no reason for her mom being and having it worse than her.

All today was about the past and health. Medical tests, consultations, waiting and results. When I got home I saw mine. I have high glucose again, my cholesterol is still high. There is something of my liver that is high as well. I read first the first tests for an idea. When I got to the hormone part I saw first the estrogen one. "less than 10" it said. Almost nothing. Maybe that was the reason he didn't order them. Men have nothing, there was no point still.

I looked the testosterone and saw no asterisk of anormality anywhere near. I saw the four and thought I did halved it. With a low dose. Wow.

Then I saw the range. 0.1 to 0.5? No. That's not right. I didn't have .8, I had 8. Why are there female range? I looked up and saw the gender changed. Female. Sex: female.

They corrected it. Someone changed it. Saw the masculine in there and considered it wrong. A medical document, a health test. I am in feminine range.

I felt happy. And again, for a moment, I forgot about everything else.

## 2016-06-14

"I forgot what I came to ask you. Oh, yeah, if I'm chosen to give the speech in my graduation would you help me?"

I made a joke if it involved make up. I know I would feel anxious and devastated if I was in his place. I keep bringing it up because I want to tell him that I've worn, too. Yesterday I wore a dress.

"Yeah, of course". I'd feel honored to help him. He is asking because he knows I gave the one in the Scholar Merit Ceremony of my school. He heard it and liked it.

I can't find the words to tell him who I really am.

I told Hilda, though.

I asked her about our trip. "No, she sees me just as always" After I told her she was accepting and thanked me for trusting in her. People don't expect it. I don't talk at all and I'm saying this huge dark secret.

I was coming from picking Miguel up.

In the morning I received a text from Rene. He was asking if we could have our session tomorrow in the morning. I saw the message instantly and tried to answer him. I was out of service. He called me shortly after.

I picked Miguel up in my shorts and t-shirt and flip flops. I had to take the right one off to push the pedals. There I was sending the messages to Hilda and waiting for the answer. I stopped in an Oxxo to put credit in my phone. We continued the conversation home. I can't open up to Miguel and Luis and I look for semi-friends. People who don't know me, who have not shared that much time with me. Those who I might cut loose and never see them again.

Catherine was coming and going the whole day. We have not had a full conversation. The longest one was when she talked with her mom about tomorrow's plans. I asked her if I could see her. I want to apply her some tests as practice before my patient. She remembered and agreed although she had plans with Miguel.

I keep looking at the pictures I sent Jessica. The results from the testosterone. The female range, it being there, controlled, in place. "How awesome that you're getting closer to what you want, not just on the outside but on the inside, too."

I thought it was going to be two months for nothing and I was proved wrong. Half of the work is done. There are some concerns still relating to the blood glucose levels and the cholesterol. I've changed my diet and am doing more exercise, still there might be some caution.

The other one was the elevated levels of the liver substance. Is it getting strained? Would I mind getting injections? Could I apply them myself or would I need my mother's help?

After seeing the female range I look up to the data and see my name and the sex. It's marked female. I'm female. Recognized by a health institution. They corrected the mistaken male mark. It was mistaken. Was it my appearance? The levels? The more fitting female range?

Maybe it was my being in a hormone treatment. Both tests before this one I was not yet on hormones nor blockers. Maybe just admitting I was taking both of them was enough for them to change their records.

Were my testosterone to shoot up would I be sent back to that male marker?

Tomorrow I'll talk with Rene and I can tell him about it. About telling Hilda. Me wearing a dress and going to the park in Saturday, the same one I went with Monica. Seeing her yesterday and having an argument with Catherine because of them. Admitting to feel shame. Projected shame.

The worry about Catherine being pregnant. The nervous of seeing the endo the next day.

Will I talk to my parents after seeing him? Will I dare to tell my grandma?

Half of the people in this house don't know about me. Both Luis and Miguel suspect things. They've seen stuff, heard. My grandma...

When Catherine was telling me about her mom, irritating me with her baseless authority and hypocrisy about Catherine's being out of the house. I was hoping she would be disrespectful to me, that she would be disapproving of me and our relationship, having an excuse of hating her.

She might had seen me yesterday in a dress and make up. I left Catherine home and both her and her sister in law were at the door.

I want them to know, all of them.

Maybe that's why I keep practicing. The moment is getting closer.



## 2016-06-16

I forgot. Again.

Just now I'm looking at both the two blank squares. I didn't come and talk about the day with Catherine. How I went with my family to the United States in the same clothes I went to session.

I'm filled with this sudden rage.

He wished me luck with today's appointment. He had seen my results from the lab. He made no comment until the end of the consult when he specified to do just the two tests he had ordered. There was a reason after all that he didn't ordered the estradiol one. I'm not on estradiol. I am on conjugated estrogen. It's equine estrogen. A bunch of equine estrogens coming from a pregnant mare's urine. My liver is metabolizing them twice.

I am having changes but they will be slow and fewer. I missed my chance again. I learned it just after coming from his office. In two months I can start by asking him to put me under a bio identical estrogen. Would he know about them? He's supposed to be this eminence of his field. Why am I coming to so many frustrations?

I was wrong the first time. The dosage is fine. .625 is a normal dosage, just of an outdated medication. My testosterone is controlled. Does he have other trans patients?

I had today the last session of tests applications. I'm done. Now it's just interpreting them and doing the report.

I feel tired, void of all energy. I missed a second effect of the medication. "Mood swings". I'm on one right now.

I haven't talked with Catherine since the end of my session and my coming home. She noticed my cutting answers.

Yesterday we saw each other. We went to the ice cream place where we did not enter that day at the beginning of the week. I applied her the tests I gave today. That was the principal reason that she accepted to see me that day. She was going to see Miguel. She saw him.

I went to Rene, and talked with him and asked him. "Have I mentioned Monica lately?" Why just now am I sensing tears in my eyes? Was I feeling sad? Why, then, am I feeling this splurge of anger boiling inside of me? Like a sudden flash of hate and a wish of screaming at the top of my lungs.

"No", he answered me. I hadn't. It was like an unintentional show of support.

I told him some things I had not said, like my wish of getting over all of this. Letting it get behind me. Not wanting to carry the trans identity with myself my whole life.

After the ice cream and the tests and going to the chicken place we stopped in the movie theater. We could not decide what to do. We ended up going home. There were some grade school girls who talked to us and waved. "What would had they said were we holding hands?" There was a deep wish inside of me of returning to her car and kissing her in the lips in front of them.

I don't mind people seeing us and judging us and calling us names. I love her. I might be a freak, a queer, something different. And it hurts of course being attacked because of who I am. But called names because of whom I love? That's nonsense. I want to hold her hand in front of the world and share our kisses internationally.

Besides her, I'm invencible.

She does not share those feelings.

It's supposed to be ok.

I have said thousands of times that I get it. That I understand and I can wait. Why am I irritated now?

Trans people from years before had been on CEE years before. One of the girls in the forum said how they were better for her than the estrogen pills.

Two months will be not a long wait. It's the same time I've been on hormones. A little less than 60 days. August. Weeks before jhonny's graduation and Catherine's parents' wedding.

I've been invited to both. I can go to both in a dress. In one I'll be with Catherine and to the other with my parents. Is that the real difference that gives me the reason to doubt?

Again, starting from 0. It was my fault. I missed the day.

Tomorrow I'll go to the laser session.

Now I'll do the exercises and go to bed.

Will I talk to Catherine?

Am I really angry at her?

I remember the reason she gave me when we parted our ways. She was tired, she had to see Miguel later. She saw her but didn't dare to ask him. She apologized, she felt like a coward. I told jhonny. I told him and she could not ask Miguel a question.

Her parents doesn't know. She hasn't broken up with Ivan. I went with Luis and my parents to the United States with a bra and a blouse and make up.

She could not come with me, again, to the endo. I needed her. I need her.

I don't feel the right to ask those things from her. Am I entitled then to feel bad because of them?

## 2016-06-17

My estrogen comes from horse piss. Pregnant marine urine: premarin.

I did laundry today. All of them is ready and folded and put in their place. Luis was lying in my bed chatting when the last batch was crumbled besides him. The gray dress the last one I wore this week was an undistinguishable ball next of the rest of inconspicuous garments. Did he notice it? Of course not. I hesitated in grabbing it and extend it in front of him so I could fold it. I told him how I could not carry the boxes anymore. I lost my strength. That's true.

I had to shower but avoid shaving. Yesterday I shaved before leaving for Rene, some hours before noon. The lady from the spa probably didn't believed me. The last two sessions I went with 12 hours fresh shaved face. This time it would be just as I was advised, 24 hours.

I took the two pills 40 minutes before the session.

In the shower I thought about the day counter app. It's more than a month since I masturbated, the last time we had sex was at the beginnings of the month. Approximately two weeks.

I realized that the dosage of estrogen I'm on, it's not that low. There won't be much changes and there's not lots of evidence to monitor because the levels can't be tracked.

Just yesterday I realized and thought about that. In the shower I felt this flashing sting under my left nipple. I had told Catherine about the sudden aches in my breast I supposedly had experienced, but this was different. I didn't even relate it to that aspect of my life. At first I thought about a slash with the razor, a shaving burn, a spot of irritation. I did not shave, though. Did I yesterday? I didn't feel anything like that. I looked for something but there was nothing there. Then I remembered the hormones.

I decided to touch myself to have an explicit starting day that I remember. A last one, a marking point. And so I tried. I got into that familiar position of reclining to the shower wall with my face buried in my upper left arm and my right hand stroking that unwanted and almost dying member.

I could not. It had been hard lately, but there was nothing compared to this. Not even the erection was full. I resigned myself and shut the shower.

I sat in the toilet and started again. This time I could culminate the self loving session but nothing came out of it, nothing material anyway. There was a climax but not physical manifestation of the pleasure felt. Like a blowed kiss or a muted scream. This was new, too.

I went to the laser place but the parking was full. Twice I entered and exit. I found some spots in the third floor, the guard instructed me how to enter.

I was welcomed by the technician. The session was delayed by a short wait so the machine could be hot enough and ready. Today it hurt more than the two first times. Even the cheeks were the familiar hot flick of a rubber band. When the laser shots went down to my neck and chin, it was a more intense pain, a more scorching and deeper penetration of hot pain. Finally, the upper lips had me in tears. I had closed my eyes, so I didn't realize I had fogged the protection glasses until I took them off. In there the sensation was exactly as a burning red little needle sliding itself into my skin.

She asked me if I use solar protection and I lied. Before the session she asked, too if I had shaved. That was the truth. She probably disbelieved me both times. The next appointment was going to be in two weeks, she didn't ask the time, just offered the two dates.

I corrected her, but instead of giving her the fourth week, I proposed the third. In four weeks it's going to be the pride. I won't be going in a sore and dark shadow of a day after laser.

I did laundry today. I reclined myself in the washing machine to grab one of the last socks in there. My weight pushed my right breast into the edge of the machine and a blinding pain made me get up. Just at the height of the nipple. I was surprised and perplexed and took my finger to that same place to try to replicate the experience. Is that really happening?

I'm on two months now, and there are some effects. They are starting.

Liliana answered my message in the morning and I didn't dare to mention my situation. Maybe in the weekend.

Vania answered Catherine back about her situation and messages. She didn't know me that well, but she didn't expect it. About her, on the other hand, she already had some suspicions.

Catherine filled her journal and mine stays now right besides the tests I should had interpreted by now.

## 2016-06-18

Have I written the words in my tablet before? Will this be the first time? Should I write with just one finger? Or maybe use both hands.

I'm in Mexicali, sitting in the couch of my uncle in the living room. My mother, and uncles and cousins and probably my grandma, even, are in the pool. Even before coming u had decided I would not get in the water.

What was my reason?

The changes are coming fast. Yesterday I had chest pains. Even sleeping I would wake up in the night with a soreness inside of my breast under my nipple. I know I had different dreams. Now it's harder to remember how I looked and felt in those. Was I a man? Was I a woman? It's not just looks, sometimes I know I look as always, others I'm a completely different person and yet, in both of those situations I would have this familiar feeling of uncertainty of how people look at me. How am I perceived?

But that was not important in these dreams. I now there were strange unknown people with me in those different and unfamiliar persons accompanying me. None of them was Catherine. One was Monica.

There is kind of a theme in the latest dreams where she makes appearance. In most of them I have new and recent information about her. Somewhere inside our conversation is some kind of apology or gesture of making ammends. The initial kindle of a reconciliation, a new foundation of a new fraternal relation.

There is no romance. I guess. Not that I remember explicitly. Although I can recall the feeling of guilt and secrecy. Why is never Catherine in those dreams?

I decided not to mention it, just as I didn't mention either how I ask RenÃ© if I've been mentioning Monica in my sessions.

She started today's conversation with her own dream.

"we didn't know each other. We met in a hotel. There was like some kind of congress and we met there. We skipped the conference and I asked you to follow me. We got into an elevator and I took you to the seventeenth floor, the second to last. It was like a parking lot. It was like the hotel down too. Like that, but the 17th floor. And there we talked and it was cheesy...

We stayed until dawn and said our good byes. Then I don't know what happened. I kept coming back to that floor looking for you but you weren't there.

The congress was over. I sneaked into the elevator and went to the 17th floor, but nothing.

It was as if I were from the city, but you were not.

Until I stopped going.

One day I went to this party in the hotel with some friends and we were already leaving for the parking lot in the first floor and I saw the elevator's doors open and I ran. I wanted to press the button for that floor but it only reached the seventh. The doors closed and it started going up. It went up to the 18th floor but as it passed the seventeenth I saw you sitting.

So I got out in the last floor and ran down the stairs. We saw each other and I hugged you. You had two closed bottles of penafiel lemonade. You were also waiting for me.

You were dressed with the leggings and the striped blouse. Your curl was a little longer.

I was wearing a pink long dress."

Mine was some kind of trip and a house somewhere far away. It wasn't important or worth remembering. I've forgotten most of it already.

We came to mexicali to celebrate father's day. I'm alone in the living room, though.

Catherine video chatted with Carlos from Chile. Today was the match of our countries in the American tournament of soccer. They won.

My mother gave me a thousand pesos for the analysis I paid. It's just 3 weeks until pride. I'm almost out of money. I haven't interpreted the tests nor started the report. I haven't mention the wish of meeting with Liliana for asking her advice about my situation.

The changes are coming faster than ever. I'm starting the third month. Two full months have passed since I started. I'm wearing only male clothes and still I sent the picture to Catherine and she told me how I looked feminine.

I mentioned something about my shoulder hairs to my mom when my father and brother were taking the boxes to my grandma's house.

"Well, they're supposed to fade away, aren't they? That's what you said, what is expected." She was talking about the hormones. There was something in her voice, this kind of subtle thrill and excitement, as if talking about a secret in the open, just hidden enough to obscure the true essence of the unknown information.

Well, I have some hairs. All of us women have somewhere.

Was she talking about them women, or us women.

Which one do I really prefer coming from her?

Is this saved?

Yup.

## 2016-06-19

Three day streak. Yesterday I did not make any exercise. We went to Mexicali. I could had not gone and it would not had made any difference. The people, the chatting and their voices, all the noise and tumult irritated me. I sat in a chair next to the dinning table between the living room and the tv room where everybody was. Karla was with her boyfriend sitting in one of the sofas. She did't introduced him to me. Maybe she didn't realize. I was just in the middle, I was the break of the two segments in which she separated the turns of meeting.

I felt awkward when my uncle, Beto, asked everyone to mock him. Tease him. Would they treat Catherine that way? Would it be awkward? It's expected of me to taking a girlfriend to a family reunion. To them I'm the oldest son of Laura.

But I am not. I am not her son. I am not a man with a girlfriend. She is my girlfriend. But I am not whom they think I am.

I should not be thinking about that. Yesterday I had the nervousness and premeditated anxiety of them knowing. I don't fear much about Edgar or my uncles, not even my grandma now. But what about the people who don't really know much. How about Irving and my uncle and aunt? What about Ivana, the niece of my aunt Luisa?

I am that nephew of Luisa who has this pretty long curly hair.

"Oh, he was queer, alright" "He ended up being a faggot" "Yeah, he's not Ivan anymore. Now he's Sofia".

I can hear the laughs, or the awkward silences. It annoys me and scares me.

Again I took and wore only man clothes there. I looked feminine. I had a beard and yet it was out of place.

The sun was scorching and the heat unbearable. Today I had my tank dripping in sweat. There was a huge wet spot in my whole back and several dark ones in my chest. It was more than 115 F.

We stopped in the Ikea where my father and Miguel returned the furniture my uncle didn't really need. After there we stopped to eat in the Jack. I accompanied Luis to the subway where he ordered a sandwich. He actually ordered it in english. I felt surprised and a little proud.

Yesterday in the pool he asked for a shirt. He was covering his pecs. My mother was annoyed when she told me. It was like if it were something weird and annoying, upsetting. Does she notices the signs, too? There are too many already.

He cried when they cut his hair, and now he covered his chest in the pool? It's not just paranoia anymore.

After crossing the border I asked them to stop at the pharmacy. My father came with me. He bought a packet of pads for my mom. I asked for estrogen and anticonceptive pills and he bought pads. He was there when the pharmacist returned with the purple and pink box and told me how they were out of aldactone. I asked for the generic and he gave me a different one from another lab. My father paid for everything.

My mother, yesterday when we stopped after the first booth, gave me a thousand pesos for the amount I paid in the blood work. Now I have a little more than two thousand. The pills are stocked for a month. The happy pills I have two weeks, but in Costco they are dirt cheap. Less than two dollars for two weeks.

I have a throbbing headache and Catherine asked me to not interpret any tests while she did the dishes.

It's sunday, I have three days without today to finish the report. I have to finish tomorrow, at least all the tests but the MMPI. I have the Rey complex figure, the rey learning test, Bender, Machover, HTP and MMPI. 6 tests. The most complex is the Inventary, although that's the kind of work I enjoy the most.

I got distracted. I thought I had finished already. I was reading the manual of the Rey complex figure. I opened up Facebook and considered sending a message to Melissa telling her about me.

My head still hurts. I ate three tacos of lamb in the morning and in the evening 10 nuggets with fries. I sweated all day and had to endure the sun. I don't think I'll do the exercise nor the tests today.

It's sunday, it's father's day.

Today I'll rest.

## 2016-06-20

Today I'm again a penguin.

I remember the day I lost my more than 190 days of continued writing. It was all for naught, like an immense tower clashing down. Now it's funny starting again. Small numbers change quicker. The four will turn into a five, when the week before it was a 0. The other bigger number will turn into a 60. 90 will be the third month, a little after pride. 120 will be a little after the next appointment to the doctor. The fourth month checked when I'll attend jhonny's graduation and the Catherine's parent's wedding will be done.

What will happen then?

Catherine came and we lied in my couch to watch television. The second to last episode of Game of thrones we saw here. The Battle of the Bastards. Jon Snow fighting for his brother Rickon, against Ramsey Bolton. After that, we saw the first episode of Orange is the New Black. Miguel got home a little after Catherine arrived. I was offering her an apple when the sound of the keys made us turn.

I did the exercise. I weighted myself before Catherine came. I had put on my shorts and tank. I stepped in the scale and expected a bigger number than before. I've eaten without care and skipped various days of activity. I was surprised when the number was lower than the one that gave me the endocrinologist last thursday. 79.1 kilograms. It's higher than in high school, higher still than my return from Spain.

I'm comfortable anyway. I'll keep losing it. Today was my first day of rest from the Elrredin, or premarin, or horse piss.

My mother arrived after Catherine took me home, yet she entered first as I was sitting in Cath's car chatting about the procedure of SRS in Thailand. Will I do the procedure? Do I want it?

We went to the Kasas Cafe outside the high school, in the plaza where I will park my car the day after tomorrow before walking to Rene's session.

My mother said something that made me cry. I had forgotten about the app. Will the number of days since crying will ever reach a number higher than 7?

She asked me directly had I congratulated my dad yesterday for his day. "You didn't either, did you? None of you did. He told me."

She's right. I did not. I did not hugged him or congratulated him, I didn't thank him for all he's done. I didn't smile at him or even see him to his eyes. I can't even type a sentence without closing my eyes to clear them from tears.

Why is it that I'm crying? What is it that makes me sad? He's the one who should be disappointed, not me.

I told Catherine how I was ashamed of it. I can't even imagine going and doing it. I am not his son. I am not his daughter, either. How can I congratulate him?

It's not that he's not my dad, he is, he is my father and he's always been. It's not what he is or isn't. It's what I am not. It's his day, not mine. But how can I note him when I don't fulfill my role?

Sometimes I do wish I had no parents. Not because I am ungrateful, not because I would want better ones, but because I don't know what to do with what I have.

I'd give up their support and caring in hearbeat. I love it and appreciate, but I can't reciprocate. I can't see them to their eyes and show myself. I can't let them know me. They would be better with just two normal sons. Not the first one, the broken one.

Yeah, I was his pride, I was supposed to be successful and this example of man. But I am not. I am something else. I am something you get ashamed of. I am the name you avoid saying in a conversation and hope nobody asks you about. You don't want to mention me or be seen with me.

I don't want to be seen.

I do want to be seen.

I want to be able to show myself. Why am I ashamed? Why do I hate me so much?

Will the hormones change this about me? They'll with modify my body and state of mind. Will they let me love me and accept me and be pride of whom I am?

Will I ever let anybody see the real me without fear?


## 2016-06-21

I spent the whole day messing with Excel. The projective test of the human figure was interpreted in less than an hour, the four drawings and the two stories, even the symbolism. Everything was done. What was supposed to be the easy and enjoyable part ended up swallowing my whole afternoon.

Yesterday came a couple of hours ago while I was in deep trance trying to understand and come up with the complicated formulas that would give me the result I wanted. He asked me if I would like to go to a camp out day of his school. It was because of father's day. There would be games and activities and stuff. It was going to be this saturday.

I'm scared of it. I told Catherine it was because of the sports. Playing, matches. I'd end up losing. I would embarras him as a big brother and my father as a son. I am neither. How can I go when I'm stop being that person?

Will anyone notice? My body is changing. I am changing, the changes are obvious. What if Luis classmates notice and tease him?

What if they don't notice? What if everybody sees me as his big brother and we end up winning and everything is alright? Would I be happy? Would I end up wishing everything was different?

No matter what I do I end up losing.

I can't not go. I can't stay away. Go further.

I am away. I don't reach for them or look for them or approach them. None of them know my name. I haven't told anyone in this house. I wish I could skip the intermediary. Go from Ivan, the big son that is a man, to Sofia, the oldest daughter who is and looks like a woman.

I try to imagine it. Me looking the part, having the voice, the presence, everything. But it's like if there was still an essence that would never go away. A phantom of who I used to be.

Miguel called home for me if I could pick him up. He was in the Taxi stop near home, the one behind the neighborhood. I actually never took that ride back. It was always the opposite way, in the whole semester I used the taxi I never used it to return, never knew where to take it.

I planned and tried a couple of times. It was easy, take it home and just climb that hill and walk home. A couple of minutes. He called me to pick him up. I used the opportunity to put gas. Tomorrow I'll go with Rene and return home. I won't apply make up, I won't dress femininely. After my session I'll came back and finish the report. Now it's just interpreting the results and writing the conclusion.

I washed the sheets of my bed, both the ones that were in it and the other ones behind the basket of laundry.

What could I write?

Nothing interesting happened today. I made breakfast after I woke up near noon. I stayed in bed, tired. I took the second resting dose. Just two more days and I'll be back on that piss. When I grabbed the sheets and put them against my chest I felt the soreness on the right one. It's still there.

My face seems rounder. It's almost noticeable, but the change is there.

I thought about sending the picture to Chevo, the one where a father is grabbing a bottle of pills and asking "Son, what are these blue pills for?", the next vignette is a trans girl obviously feminine shrugging her shoulders.

Would he understand?

We send each other almost only sad and depressing memes. They're cynic and ironic. A dark humor. We both know the sweet pain of melancholy. It's as if we share this secret joke. We laugh of that shared pain we both remember.

We use those jokes as a way of reaching out to each other. "It's your fault that my phone is full of memes, (more, please, don't stop)".

Is that his way of being here for me? Would he get uncomfortable at that intimate joke? That's something we don't share. That's intimate. That's me telling him I'm alone at home. I'm mute and this secret is eating me from the inside. I want to tell them but my mouth is closed. I want to talk, to scream. I want to be seen, but I am terrified that after showing myself, they'll turn their backs to me.



## 2016-06-22

I went to therapy. Again I dreamed. Something like an episode of How I met your mother. Except I don't remember any episode that had a similar narrative. It was surreal by nature. I was in the place of Barney. There were different places of a house. Certain symbolic clues. I realized they had to do with my real self and not the persona I was in there. Subtext of feminization, closets, clothes hidden.

I woke up with the urge to pee. I woke by it.

I have my wallet right next to me. I payed 250 pesos to Rene today. I did not pay for the hormones, my father did. I payed for the gas when I picked Miguel up yesterday. I feel this strange desire to open it up and check its insides, count it up. I know I have the mason jar with more than 20 coins of 10 pesos.

There are, easy, more than a thousand. This week I won't earn a salary. I had to cancel the session with the patient for tomorrow.

Yesterday I spent the whole day messing with the spreadsheet of the scales of the MMPI. Today I finished another table with the punctuations interpreted. It was my surprised when I realized that she had the clinical signs of schizophrenia. Should I mention it in the report, I should had showed it to Liliana before. I don't do more tests that deal with psicosis. I don't know the Rorschach. I decided to send her a message and she read it immediately. She told me to postpone the meeting. This project would be cancelled, suspended, until we checked it thoroughly.

So it is done. We didn't agree to a day or time. I hope she doesn't call me tomorrow to appoint it for Friday. This Friday I had plans with Catherine. I want to go to the United States. I want to buy something for the pride. I want to wear something new. I want to look pretty and feminine. I want people to see us and see a lesbian couple, not a woman with her transgender partner.

Today I wore casual clothes. I had to return after the session and continue with the report. Which I haven't actually started. I've finished with MMPI, all the tests are graded and interpreted, now it's just matter of integrating them together.

Rene asked me about my meeting with the endo. I talked about the hormones and my expectations. How I am taking conjugated estrogen. Why am I not taking a bioidentical one? I'll wait two more months until I can ask him myself.

I talked a little about my dad, father's day. We didn't congratulate him and it pained me. I found it hard, impossible to do, to reach out.
I cried while I was speaking. I grabbed a tissue and continued.

My mother explained me now what was exactly what Luis asked me. It's something outside in a ranch. My father would not go. I could take him instead. Of course not.

Why am I scared of being alone with them? She came down and thanked me for doing the pasta. It's nothing. She asked me but it really was nothing. I don't mind. Was she going to ask me something else? I am scared of the silences again, but it's not the same reason.

My chest is growing. This was my second to last day of rest and the ache is still there. Fading and barely noticeable but it's there. Even with a male t-shirt, I look ambiguos. I like this ambiguity. I am comfortable in it, for now. It's intentional, I can abandon it and leave it behind. I can't embrace it and look masculine. For now. I talked how in Mexicali I looked feminine. Even with male clothes, there was something in the outfit and my face that betrayed me.

Now I have no excuse. I have to see Liliana and show her the tests. I can use that moment to tell her.

"Yeah, so I will do this with the report and the results. By the way, there is something else I was meaning to tell you. It has to do with the patients but not really with her. I don't know what to do.

See, I know you know about me, Catherine has told you, and you had me in your phone as Sofia. I am not Ivan anymore. I thought it was going to be easier staying with that persona profesionally, with patients, while I leave for the master, until I transitioned.

But that's the thing, I have started transitioning. I started laser and I started hormones. I have been taking them for 2 months now. There are some changes, subtle, not very obvious, but there are. And there will be more, and I honestly don't know what to do."



## 2016-06-23

I did the dishes. I actually surprised myself with that one. What was it? I didn't want to do the report. What about it scares me? There is not my fault, the test throw those results. They're not from the projective tests, they're textual questions she answer and admitted herself. I ran the program with the different possible erroneous answers. They are invalid. The results are valid. They all are interpreted, what scares me is making the integration, putting my own words and signing them.

The most I could do is write in the report a recommendation to follow up with the evaluation with a more experienced psychologist or psychiatrist.

I'm scared of asking of Liliana the follow up meeting. What is it, the confirmation of my work or the chat that I've been delaying?

I have to tell her. I should. She ought to know. I am in transition. I've started. I'm changing.

Right now I've just come out of the shower. I'm wearing gray shorts and a blue tank top. My face is red. Was it the hotness and humidity of the bathroom? That has never happened before. My skin would be softer and clearer. Is this it? I look different in the mirror, my face has had tiny subtle changes. They're more than welcome.

My father asked me today to carry the gallon of water. I could not tell her I can't anymore. I tried. It was the one with the handle so I grabbed it from it with one hand and supported with the other. I could, I carried it to the kitchen. I put it against my chest and a soft pain in the right breast caught me off guard. Today was the last day of rest. Tomorrow I can start again with the blessed piss.

I told my parents that I'll go to the United States tomorrow. I have the money. A little less than a thousand and a half pesos. Less than 80 dollars. A little more than half.

I drank the mason jar of lemonade soda. It tasted like glory. I'm supposed to hate the sugary drinks and yet this one was amazing. Was my sugar low? I did the exercise and ate a bowl of cereal for breakfast. I ate after Luis and my mother arrived home. One torta and a plate of pasta. I don't think I'll eat anything more.

Today I weighted myself. 78. something kilograms. Was it half? More or less? Anyway, the number keeps coming down. It's a week after being weighted in the doctor's office. Almost a kilogram. That's great. It could be the losing of fat or the shedding of muscle. I hope it's the latter.

I think I'll refill the glass with water.

I can check if the redness has receded.

It's less red.

Who knows.

What is it that I want to buy tomorrow? Catherine will pick me up. The plans changed. She'll pick me up and I'll pay for the parking. Had I a coin in the car? Maybe from there I could pay it. How much dollars would I get? Will they be enough? Which would it be a better outcome, returning home with all my money or not having enough money to buy what I liked?

I decided to wear the leggings and a blouse, the one with the duck tail behind. Will they be feminine enough? Will I look too feminine?

Being trans is not illegal. It's not reason enough for keeping me from crossing the border. I should not be nervous.

The report is still unfinished. I'm halfway through the results. I don't think I want to write the conclusions until talking with Liliana.

Luis asked me today about pseudohermaphroditism. He didn't use the term, but yeah. It was something I said. I said I had no penis, not anymore. I sold it.

He's 12 but not stupid. Does he get me?

Tomorrow he won't go to school. He'll be home when Catherine comes pick me up. Will he see me? I honestly don't care. I thought about saying something about my legs. Showing them to him, telling him to see them, feel how soft they are.

I dreamed something about him. No, not him. It was Miguel, he had a seizure and I tried to see if it was an embolism. He was faking and continued saying how I was not able of taking care of nobody. My mom agreed with him. I cried and tell them to fuck themselves thinking how I will never have children. The other dream I took something from Luis, a little chain. I stole it. Why?

In another one, I was in a bar. Was I in hiding? I was doing something or waiting for someone. The girl was next to me in the border of the second floor. She was talking to nobody and annoying me. I told her she lost her watch. When she reclined to see I threw her off.

The third one was different. It wasn't me. I wasn't me. I was a young boy with a group of friends. We were in this kind of party or reunion inside a house. They called me Ivan, but I didn't look like him. I don't think I was wearing any costume. In the couch I was seating in, I found a red female necklace. It was ugly. I wore it to be funny or something. The people who were with me saw me no differently. Zayra came out of nowhere wearing this flowery dress. She came to say hi and approach us. She didn't recognize me. "I thought it was Ivan, because he's always with you, but no... you're dress as a lioness, how cute". She touched my hair. I didn't understand. I was seen female.

After it some things happened. I realized people who saw me put on the necklace didn't see me different, but those who saw me with it, kept seeing me as a girl even taking it off.

When I talked with Hilda and she didn't recognize me proving my theory right, I told her my name was Sofia.

It's easy trying to analyze the meaning of the necklace and the relationship with kept being seen as what I was before.

## 2016-06-24

Luis is right beside me. We're joking about Magikarp. He tried throwing me my own pillow while I'm typing. "Magikarp, I choose you".
He continued with the joke about Professor Oak, "are you a boy or a girl?".

Is he joking because of something.

He asked me what did I buy. I told Catherine I would tell him, jokingly, that I'd bought dresses. I did not tell him that. "Clothes", I said. I did buy dresses. I could not tell him and yet I grabbed the keys and went for the bag in the car. "Can I see what you bought?" I told him no.

"I'm talking with my mom. Finish your words."

I started them. Something happened. "Tell me when you're finished." "Is everything alright?" "We talk soon."

Is it about me? Maybe she saw the Facebook, maybe it's because it's late. Did she tell her she helped me buy clothes?

I was supposed to leave before Luis got up. I woke up early in the morning. It was even before 7 when I had my eyes open and had left the dream. It was again with Monica. We were in a hotel in Spain, not the two of us. We were four. Was the beds shared or the rooms? I remember that I share something with Homero, from grade school. The other ones were she and Mariana. There was something weird in Mariana. It was as if she were one of Monica's friends from college. As if she liked her more than me.

I remember getting in to the bathroom to get dressed and ready. The two girls would leave and I wanted to be with them, close, near. I had to hurry. Why did I want that? I remember seeing the black bra in the bed and Homer noticing it. He grabbed it and played with it. It was mine, I was nervous.

The whole dream was weird and uncomfortable. I don't want to share those times even with her memory. I try to get away, but I can't. Why can't she stop appearing in my life?

I waited until 10:30 un the morning to leave the house. Luis got down from his room. I was wearing the leggings and the striped blouse. I had just make up. In the border crossing several people approached us as ladies or called us girls. Luis saw me that way but said nothing. Since then almost everything was hard.

There was traffic leaving my house. The road that usually takes me 3 minutes, lasted me 20.

After picking her from her house, we took the highway. There was a strike of the transportists. We got to the zone of the border by near noon. There was no free parking. The parking lots were all full. Everywhere, everyone. I actually thought the trip would be cancelled. I would end up dressed and with the wallet full of money.

We got in a parking lot from downtown. After two cabs we were in line waiting. An hour and a half approximately after, we bought the tickets of the trolley. The first place was In n Out. We bought burgers and fries. None of us dared to ask for the spread.

She finally did. It was delicious. We took the trolley back to the Plaza las Americas. The first store was Old navy. In everyone I used the dressing rooms. In there I tried two dresses. One white and the other denim. The denim we both liked, but it was too tight. The button in the middle kept popping itself out. The white one was too loose down in the torso but the shoulders were tight.

The second store was one we both never had gone. Two dresses as well. The first one white and the second coral blue. Both were A-cuts.

"I want a dress" I felt an uncontrollable sensation in my insides. It was a combination between a tingle and a nervous shock. The anxiety of an unexpected fear and the excitement of a new discovery.
"What kind?" She took a normal amount of time to answer. I will never know what went through her head or what was her reaction. I could not see her. Those were the first statements I dared to declare, both to anyone and myself. I didn't expect that. A continuation, "keep going". I did not know.
"For you, an A-cut"

The white one fit better than the last. It was L. The coral blue was Medium. After seeing the white one I didn't expect it to fit. Catherine offered to look for a medium one. I said yes, but wore it anyway.

It fit amazing. I liked how I looked, my body, my face, my hair. I could not believe how It fitted. I did not buy it. The color was not of my liking.

I spent most of my money in Ross. In that dressing room, I took the limit of garments permitted, 8. The lady in there liked my hair and complimented me on it. After that she sent both of us to the left, the ladies section. Do people notice I'm trans and treat me nice because of it, with their smiles and compliments. Or are the amenities precisely because they don't know?

In there 4 things were discarded and the other four put to consideration. I bought three of them and paradoxically left behind the dress I liked the most. It was a dark brown or gray dress with black in the end of the skirt. The skirt was long and formal. It looked classy. Catherine described me as a girl going to church. "You could use it to the ceremony of the wedding of my parents."

If I liked the way I looked in the dressing room of the New York store because of how the dress fit me. I liked the way I looked in that dressing room of Ross because when I saw me wearing it in the mirrors of it, I was not embarrassed, I was not uncomfortable nor vulnerable. I looked like how I felt in the inside, like a woman.

I would wear it in front of Catherine's parents and the world.

I am indeed changing.

## 2016-06-25

I don't know why, but right now I feel like lying in bed and closing my eyes and let myself drift into slumber. Why am I so tired?

I told my parents about my patient. I said no names and no way if identification. Was it a breach of confidence? There is no connection from me to them. I shouldn't had said it.

My father yesterday asked me if I wanted to go to the United States today. I could had bought the shoes. I wouldn't had to wait that much. I fell asleep with the thought of having all those new clothes that I could not really wear. I tried them, I tried most of them and saw how they fit. Why had I still the idea of them not fitting, of having made a huge mistake?

Yesterday I took the pill, too. This is not the first day of restarting. Am I feeling their effects again? This fatigue and loss of energy, the changes of mood, the hopelessness. Are these because of the pills?

I bought a lot of things in the stores, both yesterday and today. Yesterday it was clothes and dresses and stuff. Today I bought razors and shaving cream and sun blocker and a nick stick and a filer for the papers and tests and reports. After returning home, I ordered the printer from amazon and a stick of alum and a pack of soaps. There was something else in there. Oh, right, a daily cream with sunscreen.

Sunscreen, that's the real translation.

Why am I feeling lighthearted? Is it the lack of testosterone? Maybe the estrogen pills aren't doing its effects. I'm blocking this hormone and the supply of the other one is not effective. I'm low on fuel.

I ate more than other days, and drank tea. It's not a matter of energy. I woke up early. I know I dreamed something again but I can't recall it.

In target I wandered through the girls section. I looked at the clothes, mostly the jeans. The sizes, the prices. Why did I feel so, uh, ...

I'm having a hard time even writing these words. Should it be a matter of concern?

My mother went out today with Norma and Jessica. She went to this show of opera of her ex-student, the friend of Diana. In target, when I checked Facebook, both Diana and Jessica appeared me on the list of people I might know. Diana had Yarely and Catherine as common friends. Jessica had none. Was it yesterday when my aunt Paty appeared me as well? Miguel, Caio, the italian girl, Gabriel. Lots of people appeared in that thing, and if they appear in my page, it's fair to think I might appear in theirs.

How many times have I seen somebody and not being noticed. Did Monica see me that day I was wearing a dress?

How many times have I been seen and not realized it? Maybe right now Jessica is asking my mom about the pictures where it looks like I'm wearing make up, or the facebook page with the Sofia Fernandez name.

I should be doing the exercise. Yesterday I skipped becuase I walked. Today I did not. I have no excuse today.

I took the clothes and put them in the closet. I locked the door and spread the dresses over my bed. First I wore the white blouse I bought for under the dress. I wore it and took a picture of Catherine. I saw myself in it, my body looked boxy. I did not look like a girl, well, yeah, but not really. I have not shaved and am not wearing any make up, my hair is a little messy and I feel bloated. I took the picture anyway and saved it.

In the tv, before we left in the morning, was the show of stephen colbert. The guest was the drag queen Ru Paul. I didn't know and asked who it was. My father rewinded it so we could see his welcome. I regretted it as soon as it happened. They talked about drag and coming out and he was talking about this thing that might appear have a relationship with me but they're totally different.

I felt, I don't know...

I wore the blouse and the shorts I bought. The thing that supposedly tie around my waist made me feel as a crossdressing man. I have no waist. I have no curves. There was un-stretched excess of material in the "curvy" shorts were my hips should be.

I feel dysphoric. I don't like the term but that's what I feel and tried to describe when I talked with Catherine about how I felt as if I didn't belong when I saw the clothes. How the image of them never fitting my body crossed my mind and brought me pain.

Lastly I worn the blue dress. I saw myself in it and was a little unnerved when I could not accommodate the plights of the skirt. I could not find a pose for my body to rest as the picture was taken.

There was difficulty in every attire of clothes when I tried to take them off. It exacerbates the sensation that they don't fit, that my body is huge.

Ru Paul kept referring in the feminine. Why would he go to the gynecologist? He's a drag queen, he's a gay male who dresses "in drag", as he himself describes it, to perform a show. He's not a woman. He doesn't feel or sees himself as one. He just dresses as one, disguises himself as one. He uses his femininity and wears it as a costume.

I felt similar with the snaps of jhonny. He said "cansada time", he was tired of looking "bonita". Why kept he using feminine words? He's a man. Does he sees me like that? Like a man playing a woman? Like a man playing?

I told Catherine I disliked the idea of them using the look of a woman as a disguise. But isn't that what I'm doing as well?

"Drag queens perform their shows and they took their dresses off and lived their lives again as men. Transgender women, never stop being women."

I do, I, as well, perform my show and took the clothes and make up off and live my life again as a man. I wear the clothes as a disguise, I hide. I am ashamed.

I am not a drag queen. It's not that I am not trans either.

I'm just a coward.

## 2016-06-26

Why am I feeling like crap? I did it, I went to the United States and bought all those clothes. I tried them on yesterday and I didn't look awful. They fit, I guess.

Why am I this tired? I continued the hormones again. They are supposed to lift my mood and give me energy. Today I woke up near 6 in the morning. I fell asleep hours after Catherine. I'm exhausted. I got up to eat breakfast and returned to bed. I slept all the way until the first hour of the afternoon.

I haven't finished the damn report. I didn't send the text message to Liliana to schedule the meeting. I haven't done nothing at all. Yesterday I saw myself in the mirror and saw my face changed. It has been changing, the cheeks are fuller and the lower side is narrower. The skin is thinner, too.

Even after two days of no shaving, there are traces of femininity in it.

Why do I feel like an abomination, then? Days keep passing by, counting on. Changes will keep coming.

Anahi told us about going out. It was yesterday, I think. I told her I did want to go. I do. I've been telling Catherine I feel like going out for a drink and having a good time. She doesn't ignore me, but I don't get an answer either.

She had said a date but I missed it. I thought it was about making plans on thin air. The second of July, this saturday. Fine, I have nothing. The days start coming until after the first week. The seventh is Luis graduation, and the next day the next appointment of laser and then the next week, pride.

Until the next month I'll see the endocrinologist.

There is no urgency. Actually, this going out will be sooner than I'd like. "What can I wear?", I asked Catherine. I expected, and actually explained myself later, just an idea of an outfit. A draft, something to later make my mind upon. She answered me almost instantly: the blue dress.

The new blue dress. I don't have shoes to wear with it. I could use the black flats. Whatever. But, really? Could I wear it?

Would she come pick me up? Would I drive? How would I left home? Would I dare to leave home with make up and a dress? I'd be seen. I haven't said anything to my brothers and told almost nothing new to my parents. Just typing this now makes my eyes tear up. As if I'd committed a huge betrayal.

So I'll have to hide again, then... Change in the car before leaving and change before entering home. Catherine asked me if I didn't want to drive. I told her I didn't mind. I actually forgot my huge discourses of how I've been hating driving lately. I know my father could offer me to drive me and pick me up. Would I let him?

What is it that I fear? Them seeing me? A comment? No, I feel my dad's reaction and worry.

"Will you go out dressed like this?" And those judgmental eyes filled with worry and shame. If he, that he's my father, sees me that way, how would other people, strangers, act around me? What will I do if I get into trouble? Maybe policemen will come and harras me because I'll look like a prostitute, I'll be seen as cross-dressing whore. Maybe the bouncers in the bars won't let me enter because of the difference in the picture of my id and name and how I'll look. Maybe people in side the bars will call me names and laugh at me, maybe drunk people will approach me and rape me or worse.

"What will I do? What am I doing? Am I really going out like that?"

"Aren't I scared or worried?" "Are you out of your mind?"

Yes. I am, I am sick and broken and damaged goods.

Why am I bawling my eyes like a little child? It hasn't even happened. I can avoid all that. He doesn't have to know.

Not yet, not now.

Nobody has to know still


Yesterday I was in Target when I saw the pages of those people. I told Catherine I would be posting the post in the next few weeks. But if I can't even start a conversation with Melissa how am I going to tell everybody?

Before that I have to tell Luis.

We both know he knows already. Why are those words stuck in my throat?

## 2016-06-27

After finishing yesterday's words I could not stop crying. The text Catherine received from me said that I had finished and was already lying in bed. I can't remember the theme of conversation. She said something, talked about something. Was it a question? I stated how I was crying. Tears kept coming and coming, sorrows getting stuck in my throat, the pain flowering from my stomach all the way to my mouth and nose and eyes. I closed my eyes, but it kept leaking, flowing out like a river falling in a waterfall.

What was it that put me in that state? Were they thoughts or feelings? Did I imagine something? I might had feared some approaching threat.

The last things I wrote about were the possible comments and warnings my dad would give me after seeing me in a dress, ready to go out saturday night.

I feel caged in my own secret. It's not home, it's not silence, it't not intolerance. What is it that keeps me trapped? Is it fear, shame?

I cried and cried. I kept crying while I copied yesterday's words to Catherine's conversation. I was turned to the wall with my eyes puffed and my cheeks red. The pillow was soaked and room darkened. The only light was from the phone turned down to the mattress and the tablet streaming music from spotify.

Did we talked about it? How I feel. I confessed how she made me feel worse when she asked me to change the subject. She apologized. It didn't matter, I said. It doesn't.

"It does matter. You matter, Sofia"

I don't feel it that way. I stated it. She answered back an hour later but I was already asleep. I saw the message at dawn, when I woke up from one of the different dreams I can't remember. In one of them I threw a kick to the wall and the pain in my toes brought me to full consciousness.

I should be finishing the report of the patients. Everything is done, I've applied the tests and interpreted them. All of them are ready. Now, it's just a matter of transcribing what is it that I found. I wanted, I've been meaning to send Liliana a text asking for a free time so we can chat. Today after returning from the dinner of Miguel I sent her the message. She saw it almost instantly but there was no answer.

I could had called her.

The report isn't done. I purposely waited until the afternoon so she would not ask me to come in an hour or two.

I'm scared of what she could tell me. I am scared of what I have to tell her besides the results of this patient. I have not seen her in weeks. Will she notice the changes?

She has to know. I will tell her, I can't wait any longer.

Catherine came today. She left home a little later than she had planned. Her grandpa has not returned since yesterday. He's lost. He did not come back from work. Even now, they still have no news of him.

He passed to the wings place and ordered some. I made french fries and boneless and even made some of my own spread similar to the one in In N Out.

We watched the final episode of Game of Thrones while we ate the food. I knew we would do something to celebrate Miguel's birthday. I did not congratulate him. I did not buy him a gift or made anything to him.

Not even a happy birthday.

He got home while I was doing my hair. I decided to wear something feminine. Woman's jeans and a blouse. On top I wore a shirt to cover the outline of the bra. When I exit to receive her she saw me. I asked her, but she told me I looked like a girl. I did not mind. I wanted to, I wanted to seem feminine when my parents come home, I wanted to be seen, noted. I wanted to say about this saturday. I'll be out. I don't know what I will wear. I want to wear a dress.

I want to. Why does it feel even weird to type it? It's nothing to be ashamed of. I am a woman. I am trans. I look like a woman. Women wear dresses. I bought it, it's mine. I should be able to wear it and be outside in it.

Why do I still have the need to hide it.

Catherine helped me to select even more clothes to get rid of. I filled a black bag. Some of them I gave to Luis. I could tell my mother about it tomorrow. Get the subject out.

"I took a lot of clothes out of my closet. Some they don't fit anymore, and some I don't like. They're too manly." Maybe she can ask about the clothes, the changes, the hormones.

Yeah, I've been changing. I've been going outside in female attires and being seen as a girl. And I like it, I feel at home.

Not like here, where I have to hide in my own secret.

## 2016-06-28

Little things do I hate more than having the hiccups.

I did today's and yesterday's exercise. I finished the report. I did the first half of the results lying one the couch watching the movie of Big Hero 6. The second I finished it here in my desk. Miguel arrived after noon. It was maybe 2 or 3. I disconnected the printer to connect my laptop. He was lying in the whole couch asleep.

I had to stop writing because of those damn hiccups. The jumping make my hands miss the keys.

I did the exercise early today, the amount of two days. I sweated and went to shower. In the morning after eating breakfast and taking the pills I went to my mother's restroom. I looked at my reflection and saw my face. The skin is noticeably clearer. There are changes from before. Even in the pictures of yesterday, where I don't I even like how I looked, my face looks different. The chin is less pronounced and my cheeks are fuller.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. What happened this week? I went to the united states and bought clothes. I used the dressing rooms and bought dresses. I wore the gray and black one. I tried several in different stores. I spent most of my money. I have the attire I can wear in the pride Parade.

Anahi invited us to the party, this saturday. I talked with Catherine about going or not. I can see myself wearing something different. Now it's not so far away the idea of really going to the graduation dresses as a girl. It's two whole months and spare days until the day come. By then Luis and Miguel have to know about me. After them knowing, after everyone in this house seeing me I will post the Update.

What is it that keeps me from talking with Luis? We don't talk seriously. We joke and share insults and memes. With Miguel is even less than that. Could I tell Miguel first? Just even thinking about it makes me nervous. It's not him knowing or his reaction or what he would think or feel. It's opening up, saying it. Talking.

I'm sure Luis has noticed more, maybe suspects or knows more.

It doesn't matter. This week I don't think they'll know.

I had thought about telling my mom about the clothes I took out. Did I saw her? She arrived with Luis. She asked me why Luis thought my grandma had come. That was the conversation we had.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. I sent him the text message asking him for the time. I referred myself as Sofi. A little later I sent another to Liliana asking her if I could see he tomorrow. Her son answered me telling me she would call me when she gets up.

I haven't received anything new.

Tomorrow I'll dress even more feminine. I'll wear the shorts I bought and a t-shirt with a long neck.

I almost weighted myself today. I had made the exercise. No, I've done just half of it. I stepped with one foot on the scale and saw the numbers fluctuate. Yesterday I did nothing. I went to bed without finishing the report nor doing the exercise. Catherine felt bad, tired, nauseous. Today when she was showering she felt lightheaded and had to get out of the shower.

Her grandfather came up today. They did took them after going out to party. Everything is fine.

What am I nervous about? Seeing Liliana, telling her about me. She knows, probably more than Luis but possibly not much. Even then opening up and telling about the name and saying it and asking for her help makes me feel uneasy. Besides it, facing the client doesn't make me feel as stressed. That was it. The test, the results. I graded it after seeing him. I could had used his counsel.

This thursday probably I won't see her. The next one will be Luis' graduation, and Friday will be the laser session. This saturday will be the meeting, going out. Will I dare going out and be seen by my parents? Why am I scared and nervous? Is it the comments, their eyes, their faces? Do I mind the thinks they will say, to my face or my back? Or are more the things I will see? Maybe is their thoughts and feelings. Those I can't change nor control. They feel it anyway sooner or later. There is no difference if they see me this saturday or next week or next month.

It doesn't matter if the've known for a week or a year. The impact of seeing me different, changed, will be the same.

I avoided the mirror for months. What did I think and feel when I finally dared to see?

## 2016-06-29

I know I dreamed something today. I had to wake up so I could go to the bathroom. I was in a movie theater. The halls were full, and showing different movies. Was I with my family or alone? No, I was with some people. The whole day I hadn't thought about it. I was running down the flights of stairs. I got into a bathroom. I stood in front of the urinal, the flyer of my pants open. Did I think about which one to use? Did I consider the clothes I was wearing or how I was presenting?

I woke up and went straight for the bathroom. People stop wetting the bed in their early years. I've never told Rene how I never really stopped. There were always single moments after they had ended. Almost routinely every two or three years. I remember being in jr high, being in highschool. Was I once even in college?

It never occurred to me to think about the context of those situations. They were always accidents. One dream, I try holding it in but woke up with the pajamas wet and warm. It was shameful and embarrassing. It was not a call for attention or help, it was not regression.

For a time I actually thought there was something wrong with me. I developed the habit of trying to go to the restroom just moments before falling asleep.

I was woken up today by my mother but not in the usual way. My cellphone started ringing and I picked it up. I didn't think it would be Liliana, I didn't think it would be anyone specifically. It was her, she asked if I would go out today. I answered yes but didn't say where. When? I answered. She forgot her purse. She told me why it was important of her to have it as if she needed to give me a reason to ask for a favor.

I could take it to her. Just before therapy. I did.

I showered and shaved and shaved and combed my hair with my fingers and put sunscreen and make up and tied my shoes. I looked very feminine. I liked it. I didn't care.

I drove to her school. I parked in a second lane and got of the car with two purses. Her and mine. I wore sunglasses but my lips were red. The shorts covered most of my thighs but my calves were bare and smooth. Did anyone see me enter? I walked towards her classroom. She was outside surrounded by her class moms. She approached me and her eyes were open. For a second they were wide. As if she was surprised. Was it because she recognized me out of the blue? Wasn't she expecting me? Was she expecting me looking different?

There were no comments or exchanged words. Neither of us said anything. "I have to go" I really had. I drove towards therapy.

I sent snapshots to Eusebio and Jhonny. I saved two of them. Jhonny asked me if I had nothing to do while I waited. I could try painting my nails.

There was a message in my phone that caught me by surprise. It was Johanna. Two of them. She apologized for not answering before. That was the only thing I saw before the next one came in a second notification. How am I doing, how's life lately?. I swiped the notification to get it out view. It scared me. I thought and made peace with her rejecting me, forgetting me.

I mentioned it to Rene after talking about my patient and Catherine's parents' wedding and jhonny's graduation and this saturday's dressing situation. Catherine told me to see it, read it before I entered with Rene. I did. The message was longer than I had thought. In it she mentioned what I said before. She's happy for me, if it makes me happy, she's impressed with what I've accomplished.

Why do those words mean nothing for me no more?

It's supposed to be better to have less rejecting people. It's absurd to be disappointed that the number in the people who gave up on me shrank.

My eyes teared up in this subject. I related Johanna with Monica. Both of them were my friends, closer than most people in times I was alone. Both of them ended up in silence. And then she came back out of it, she's happy for me, she continued the conversation, she cares.

And the other one...

The other one will always be gone.

She's the only one who have rejected me. Why does that hurt more than having several people denying me?

I'm not out of home. I didn't get out of the city or went to an amusement park. I'm here, I'm in my room. I'll type them here in the phone. The lights are out, but the sun still illuminates the room besides mine. The tablet is playing a son of the son of John Lennon.

I am sad, I am tired. The whole day I spent it crying. Last night the conversation with the three of us in whatsapp dealt with this Saturday. I have less money than I thought. I ought to put gas. I won't be able to leave the house wearing the dress. I'll hide again and change outside home because I'm so coward I don't dare to show my parents what they already know. I won't be able to drink. There was no point in me even going. Yesterday the conversation with Catherine ended when she asked me how I was and if I wanted to talk. It wasn't that I didn't. So I stayed awake a couple of hours still.

This morning I put the clothes out which I was going to wear. I tried the blouse after showering. I didn't like it. I didn't like how I looked. I hate how I look.

I changed a couple of times and ended ironing one of the new ones. I wore that one. It wasn't that I liked it more. I just hated it less. I hadn't worn it before.

Catherine, before me getting out of bed sent me a text telling me that jhonny had just said that he had a meeting, so we could see us an hour later. She'd pick me up a third after two.

She was late. She told me how she was leaving home. She got stuck in traffic, and missed the exit and then a red light. The last message said that she was already late so she'd buy gas.

"it doesn't matter, you're almost always late"

A little after she sent me a text message saying that she was here, and an audio asking me to be walking outside. She was angry, no, she was upset. She asked me why the text. Why did I say that? To tell her something, say something. I stayed quiet, silent. My mouth was shut. I apologized but she insisted, she asked again and her eyes got misty, her lips started trembling. I put my head on her arm. I wasn't consolling her. I wanted to hide. I was ashamed.

Shame. Will I ever stop being ashamed?

That was how we met today. She stopped for gas and the whole trip there was silent. I kept crying a little, trying to hold the tears. In the parking of the cafÃ©, I couldn't kept them in. The whole ball of emotions escaped my hands,and rolled and rolled and became this huge thing that was unstoppable and uncontrollable.

We stayed there until jhonny arrived. I kept letting it out. Talking about what I can't remember. No. I was silent. I said nothing and cried all.

We got out and she ordered. I asked for nothing. She offered me some of her chips but I declined. I don't deserve food. I want to starve until I shrink and become invisible.

He talked with us about Miguel, what happened, his job, stuff.

I tried to smile. I could for a while. Did he see the tearmarks on my cheeks or the redness of my eyes? No, of course not. Nobody notices anything.

We talked about where could we go next. A park, maybe. The beach still? She decided to go to the one in front of the Mexico Institute. I said nothing about it, and even I offered the Hacienda one.

We ended up on Playas. She parked near the park in front of the beach. We got out of the car and started walking towards the beach. I saw a black pick up getting out. I was going to joke it was my dad just before I started considering. I saw the model, the color, the shade of the man driving it.

I turned so he would not be able to see me. And it hurt me, the action, the shame. We were just talking about him.

I talked about something before jhonny. She told me about Anahi and how she reacted after my message.

"Don't get angry at me", she told me after I answered. Near the beach we sat and I continued crying and talking. The conversation was the same, this Saturday the options we had, what we could do.

Uber, Anahi's brother, my changing at her place. Those do nothing with my problem. I'll still be hiding, I'll still be a coward.

I'll never stop being Ivan the cowardly boy.

Las time I wrote here it didn't saved. I hope this won't be like that.


## 2016-07-01

I didn't realize a new month had just begun.

In the morning I woke up after last night filled with sorrow and tiredness. I slept an hour after finishing the words and woke up an hour shy of midnight. There was a message in the screen of my phone. "Aay, you really are such a woman n.n", said jhonny. Did I open it or was it just the notification?

I know there was no obvious emotion that surfaced. A smile appeared on my face and the huge and dark cloud of sadness became lighter.

A woman. such a woman. He was surprised, like, amazed. I felt validated. He saw me with eyes teary and puffy and my the tears barely dry on my cheeks.

So I fell asleep. Today I would have to say to my parents about tomorrow's plans. I'm still stressed about that. How will I leave home? It's all set with Anahi and his brother. He can take us to our homes for 100 pesos. My trip home is done. But how will I get there? Today was it, I think, when Catherine told me she could order a uber for getting to the plaza and picking me up here. Sure, that's another solution. And yet, the main problems stays unsolved. I will have to change here, I will have to get dressed and made up and stand in the living room and call my leaving and seeing them to their faces.

Am I scared of their eyes? Am I scared of their emotions and thoughts or am I scared of their words?

For months I've been scared of Luis reaction, his answer.

He came just a little after I woke up to tell my, ask me if I could pick him up from school at 1 o'clock. The whole morning I stayed doing nothing. I took up and went to the living room. I guess I watched some tv. I haven't picked up the book. I actually liked it, why haven't I returned?

I made breakfast for myself. The english muffins I bought were supposed to be eaten before Miguel's birthday. The house was alone. I found a thin black belt that I could wear with the dress instead of the black one.

Now in the afternoon, after my parents came from taking Miguel to the billiards and bringing food. My mother asked something about the dishes. Why haven't anyone done them. I said that I did them the last time. She took it as if I said it was her turn. "What is it that you've done all week?... You are not doing anything. I am working the whole day, it's so tiring because these days" bla bla bla. I was hurt. I wanted to say something about tomorrow and after that I kept my mouth shut. She hit Luis in the back and he said it hurt. She kept at it and joked that she was giving him a massage, like denying guilt, acting playfully. Luis kept on explaining something about a bone or something, and she started saying how delicate he was, in this loud voice as if the joke was shared. I, annoyed by the early comments, killed her playfulness:

"Don't scream, I can't hear the tv". She did shut. He face dimmed subtly into seriousness while she grab her things. She walked upstairs, and both of us, I imagine, felt shitty.

I was going to pick him up. If I leave the house tomorrow dressed, I will have to face most of them. So, everyone had to know by tomorrow. I could tell Luis in the way back after picking him up. I imagined it. Rehearsed it in my head. Played with the words and arranged them.

Later, whe sent me a text message asking if I could pick him up an hour later. Later, my dad would sent me another one telling me that Luis would ask me to drive him to a friend's house, to confirm him after I took him there and he would pick him up in the evening.

Everything was ruined. I could not say anything if I was just a ride. How would he deal with everything just before going to this other house?

I parked and entered the school asking for him. I entered and there were two men sitting in a couch just ahead of the hall. The principal faced and asked Rossy if they said that someone would pick Luis up. I had my eyes hidden in the shades. Rossy recognized my voice and told him yes.

"Yeah, his mother said his, uh... " he looked at me for a moment and then said doubtfully, "brother... would be here"

After he got into the car, I waited for him to tell me about this other house. He didn't so I asked. No, it was cancelled.

I felt this nervousness. The words getting stuck in my throat. I made the first attempt asking if he have seen me any different. It was before entering the fast lane. I didn't say anything again until we were exiting it.

"Remember how you've been asking me about trans people? I am trans myself."

"Really?"

"Yeah" "But... how?"

"I was a girl before and turned into a boy before you were born". I looked at him, but not enough to see if he believed me or not. "No, I'm joking... the other way around. I'm turning into a girl."

I explained, how I've been going to the doctor and taking blood tests and the pills I take are hormones. "But isn't the testosterone stronger?" "Yeah, but the other pills I take block it".

"Oh, it's fine." "It's ok" "I've always wanted a sister".

He took it as if I had just told him I decided to change majors.

Am I relieved? Nothing of which I feared happen. The only one in this house that doesn't know yet is Miguel.

Luis was clueless. Or at least that was he said. I asked him about the make up or the clothes. He denied noticing. The questions? It's just because they don't appear in the books. The make up? Just lipstick once...

And that was it.

He knows even more than my parents. He knows the name, he has seen pictures. He knows me now, more than my whole family. He kept being close, with me, in my room, playing and joking as if nothing had happened.

There is still tomorrow to deal with.

## 2016-07-02

The tickers for Pride in two weeks are now printed. They were the first impressions of the new printer that just came up in the mail. Finally Miguel accused me of being the one who disconnected the other printer and making it break again. He said in the Denny's dinner when they were talking about Luis. "Who are you saying disconnected it? It wasn't him. It was Ivan."

Nobody said anything else.

We were to the United States. We've return. Now Catherine might be getting ready. I should be doing the same. In two hours she will be on the way to pick me up. I was supposed to tell my parents, tell them ahead, give them notice, that I would be leaving the house in a dress, I'd be going outside in femme mode, I would be out at night as a woman.

I'm scared, I'm nervous, I feel guilty and ashamed. I didn't tell them. I don't know if I will.

Fortunately the living room is empty. There is just Luis in there with his ipad. My dad is shoeless lying n bed watching his shows. My mother will stay in her desk working on the countless things she has to do. Miguel might come down or stay in his room.

If everything keeps itself the way it is, I might be ok.

If not, the most probable thing is I'll be seen. I might be questioned, they might be stunned or surprised. Is that the way it should be done? It's nothing wrong. I'm not doing something forbidden. I'm in all my rights of leaving the house how I please. I should not be worrying about telling them, asking for their permission. Even in Denny's in a silly attempt of getting the conversation flowing I told them Catherine would be picking me up by 8. My mother asked if today and kept her sight on me. My dad asked her why, what was she going to say? Nothing, it was the way I said it, as if I were asking for her permission or acceptance.

Then they're not expecting me of saying anything.

We picked the printer and ate breakfast. We went to a store for my mother to find clothes for her ceremony of closure. I tried, I actually tried going around looking at the clothes, just wandering. It was uncomfortable, I had this idea in my head of what I should be telling them, and I was afraid of them noticing my anxiety, what was I hiding? Why was I shaking and distant and quiet?

I couldn't. My mother looked for shoes. And I wandered, too. I looked at the flats and the boots. They were expensive, more than I'd be even capable of asking for. I found it hard for asking my dad for the 3o dollars of the payless shoes' flats.

After leaving the mall, we stopped in Best Buy. The were going to look for the printer cartridges and Luis wanted a cable.

Luis. He's the only one who knows I'll be leaving in a dress today. He saw the picture. "Will you be wearing the black?"

I'm not scared of standing in front of me and asking him to tell my parents I left.

I would even do it in front of Miguel. Miguel, who does not know.

Why did I leave him for last?

Was it in the dinner? Yeah, it was. It was before of the printer thing. I told them nonchalantly how I have lost the strength of my upper body. "I've no longer strength in my arms" "which one?", asked my mom. I replied that both of them and told her how I could not carry the printer in the mail and was tired of just lifting it from the carton box.

My father looked straight at me and intervened: "Why?"

I saw directly to his eyes when I answered: "it's because of the pills"

Just that sentence, that was enough for everyone to understand. He closed his mouth and his eyes and shook his head slowly, dripping disappointment. I felt like crying. No, I was upset. I felt a little anger. I'm opening up. I'm telling you, sharing. You're dismissive. How do you want me to come to you? How do you forbid me to claim I'm alone?

Before entering the best buy I went my own way to the payless shoes. I entered and went directly to that part. I tried a couple of them. The clerk passed besides me and said hi.

I left without buying anything, he said good bye.

When we were to target, I asked my dad for 30 dollars to go to the store while they were in Target. He acceded and gave me two 20 bills.

I went and tried them again, although I've done it countless times.

I bought them. The lady asked nothing and said nothing. She smiled and was kind. I did it. I did not tell anyone.

And here I am, typing although I've gotten to the goal. I'm scared of getting ready, I'm scared of going upstairs, and leaving.

I am afraid and scared.



## 2016-07-03

Yesterday I could leave the room. I heard steps and the sound of the microwave. My father was downstairs. Someone was playing Xbox, I thought it was Miguel, but later heard their voices. Catherine had left her home, she was on her way. I waited for my father to go upstairs, to leave. I could just tell Luis that I'd be leaving and to tell my parents I was gone.

It never happened. She was closer and closer. She got to the 5&10, she was in the bridge. I had to leave it. I was wearing the dress with the black long sweater over it, the brown shoes barely covered my feet, the rest of my legs were bare to the end of the skirt. My face was pale and my lips were red. The purse was hanging from my shoulder and the keys jingled in my hand with every step.

It was time. My heart was racing. I had to do it, so I did it. I opened the door and saw him sitting in the table. Luis was in the couch with the controller in his hands. I didn't stop from my door to the front one. His eyes met mine on the way but his expression stayed the same. "Have they come to pick you up?" "Yeah, they're here", I mumbled with the words as nervously as I kept walking.

"Bye, Ivan", said Luis even though he knows now my name. I didn't mind. My father doesn't. I don't think he does.

After exiting the door, I was relieved. It was no more than 3 minutes what I waited before I saw the lights from the Jetta that picked me up. I sat in the back seat with Catherine and explained what had happened with my father and Luis, and how I had told him and bought my shoes. She started telling me about the conversation with Andie. She knows now. I added her on Facebook and started a conversation.

We talked in the morning and later now in the afternoon. I spent most of the evening talking with Melissa. She knows, too.

We started talking about her job and service, her work with her patients and all that. After that, she asked me about my life, outside of the work things. And I took the opportunity. I am trans, and kept explaining. She had seen the profile. She remembered I had no sisters. I never spoke about one. She put two and two together. It made sense. She took my offer of asking any questions and we talked about lots of things. She disclosed me some intimate things, too. She's never had a relationship, she's never had sex either. She doubted of her sexuality for a while.

"The curious thing is that you look good as a woman and as a man. I commented it to Anna, and she knew it, too. (It was the same way.)

So now two more people, know. Three if I count Anna. I sent a friend request to Johanna, another to Anna. I considered sending them to all the people who know about me. It was the starting idea. I could add Garab, too. I stopped it there. I thought about the other people that were missing. Luis, my parents, Monica.

Do I want to add her? Do I want her to accept me or not?

I stopped.

In the other profile, I added Zayra and Maru. One of them accepted me already. I want them to know my change. I want them to hear my news. Every person I've told has received the news cordially and amicable. Everyone has been nice and supportive. All but one. She was the first to know, it wasn't immediately. It took time. She loved me, more than anyone but Catherine. Maybe that's another factor.

All but Miguel knows in my house. Just Luis knows my name. If they know will I ask them to change the way the call me? Do I want them to?

My father said nothing, is he denying it? He's not making any comments, it was as if nothing had happened. Did he see me? Did he tell my mother?

I have the message ready to send to Miguel. It's fine that I send one. I don't dare to do it in person. Lots of people have seen the profile. The list of suggested people has grown. Now there's Monica and him. There is Medrano and Consuela. There are a lot of new faces.

When I was a child I discovered something that seems simple and obvious enough but to my it was a profound and significative learning. If I'm seeing somebody, it's almost sure that they can see me back, too.

I'll send it to him.

## 2016-07-04

My head hurts. Luis is right besides me talking. He is talking with me. Miguel is in the dinning room watching the Captain America movie that I was watching. Why do I feel weird?

Yesterday I sent him the message. I was here in this room typing the words, he was outside doing his homework or something. Did I send them before or after going to bed?

Luis doesn't know. Or maybe he does.

I didn't wait to read his answer. I closed the messenger and chatted with Catherine.

Right now I can't stop, uh... what's the word for when you open your mouth and inhale profusely because of tiredness? I can't remember it. The pulsing ache in my heads is just between my eyes.

I kept looking for the little ball with his face to appear under the message signaling he had read it. I didn't stay. After a while I entered and exited. I saw it finally and closed it faster than other times. Catherine was as nervous as I, or even a little more. Was it today or yesterday when she cried because of the frustration of not being able to tell her father?

He asked her today: "Why doesn't that Ivan come anymore?" Her heart raced. She stayed silent.

Miguel did answer. It took him a couple of minutes but he answered back. I was not ready to read him. I had to wait. I fell asleep and dreamed about a school or something. There were deaths in the dream. I woke up in the early morning and read it. It was way longer than the one I sent him. He admitted to having noted it, way long before I told my parents or even started opening up. He heard about the pills, the first ones. Maybe he heard me crying or something. He mentioned the conversation I had with my mom on the table, he just overheard but caught the idea. He knew about the subject because of reddit, tumblr and the internet. My mom did talk with him. He would wait until I were ready to open up. He used a female noun to describe me in there.

He was understanding and caring and supporting. He noticed me before anyone. He said how he stills admires me and wants to be like me. I felt like crying, but I didn't.

Today I sent him a friend request. He accepted in the evening. I sent one to Luis, too, but he hasn't. I was worrying about hte reason. He mentioned it first when I talked about his ipad and why he took it from my hands. "Are you sure you want me to add you?" "Why do you ask?" "Because of what you said, that it would appear to other people"

Was he worrying about me or him?

Could I blame him?

Garab accepted the request, too. I even sent one to Enrique, Anahi's brother. I don't really expect him to accept me. I just wanted to send one to everyone who knows about me. I almost have. My mom and father are still left. And there will always be Monica. Her profile appears now in that place. She might see me, too.

"I look good as a man and a woman" "You do are such a woman"

Why can't I believe it?

When I talked with Melissa yesterday, she confessed how she still saw me as a man, as the man she knew.

It hurt. Of course it did. I am not one. That I have never had difficulty accepting. But I told her something I never claimed before. I am a woman. I feel like one. I don't identify as one, I am one.

Inside, outside?

I was not once misgendered leaving home saturday night. Everyone treated me as a girl. I looked like one. Even Anahi's mother in the way Anahi told us, asked her if we hug... as girlfriends.

We are girlfriends. We are a lesbian couple. We're two women who love each other.

How can I convince every one if I don't really believe it myself. If I'm not really a woman, then what am I?

I thought about posting the status, the information, saying out loud to anyone who might hear. My grandmother came today. She rang the doorbell and hugged me.

Will I tell her? Am I scared of her reaction? She might be understanding, she might not.

I won't hide from her. I won't hide anymore. Not in this house, not this wednesday.


## 2016-07-05

"Can I call you Luis-broad?"
"No, can I call you Ivan-belly?" "No" "...Sofia-belly?"

It wasn't uncomfortable or awkward. It was unexpected. His words had meaning and I comprehended them, and yet my mind stayed blank for a second. The silence came and he talked again.

My grandmother gave the rings to show Catherine. One is black with silver and the other has the colors swapped. They are not ugly. I showed them to her. I put on the crimson pants and went to her. I asked her if she could slim them a little. She did, they're fine. They're not as tapered as I asked her, but it's better this way. They're ready. Just before my mother arrived and took her to the bus central. She will return to Mexicali and attend the graduation of my cousins. After that, this Thursday, I guess, will return to go to Luis' thing.

I've already told my mother about taking Catherine. The pants are ready and I can wear them.

This friday I'll go to the laser session. Three weeks after the last one. I believe I have two paid ones left. This one and the one in august. She didn't ask me last time about doing it when. This week I'll be very clear about being four weeks apart.

Next week will be Pride parade. A year from the first time I wore the clothes outside.

Luis knows, Miguel knows. My father has seen me in the dress and my mother asked me again about the effects I've experienced.

Now that my grandma is gone, everyone in this house knows about me. Two of them know my name. Maybe my parents have seen the Facebook profile, too. Maybe.

I feel the urge to post it. Post the thing and go public. See the number of friends grow. Accepting people, people who know, who've seen me.

I remember when I could count the contacts with the numbers on my hands. Now it's 20. 20 people.

I had to cancel the request to Luis and Anahi's brother. I couldn't deal with the waiting. Even the Zayra one in the other profile makes me uncomfortable. I wanted her to know. I wanted her to see the changes I've gone through. Did I wrote it in the mails I sent her? The biographies of both Psychotherapy and Tanathology.

There is another urge that I don't dare to mention with Catherine. I added Luis and Enrique because both of them knew about me. There was that other person. Why do I feel the need to send the request? It's not that I really want her friendship. I want her to see me. I want her to see the name and recognize the history. I met her and told her she looked like her. At the beginning she feared that she would never be able to live to Sofia's standards, to fulfill her role, fill her shoes.

How ironic and tragic that she was right.

I want her to see the picture and see the other ones and notice how I've changed. I want her to think that I am almost unrecognizable, that I am nothing like the man everyone thought I was.

I don't have to add every person who knows about me. Vania, the friend of Catherine's she met today, knows me, too. I didn't think about adding her. My parents stay unconnected from this new profile. They haven't even heard the name.

Vania asked about me, why Sofia?

"Oh yeah, it's that she knew, even though she heard a thousand names, she was and is Sofia"

New people referring to me in the feminine. Her, Andrea, Melissa. Even Melissa who admitted she keeps seeing me as the man she met and knew. It's the complete opposite of what I believed. I didn't want their tries, I wanted the real and honest thoughts. Why do they make me smile?

Luis used my name and Miguel referred to me in the feminine in his answer.

He hesitated when saying my name when he rattled about me disconnecting the printer. He didn't say "he", he stopped and then pronounced Ivan.

No, I'm looking way too much into it.

I don't think I'll add Monica.

But probably I will post the message in Facebook tomorrow. I'll wait until after the session and talking with Rene about it.

Yeah, there was no point in making it public what was the necessity of screaming it to the world?

The three or four people that now know me since last week besides my brother had already seen the profile and recognize me through it. Lots of people must have seen it, too.

I can just admit it and prove to myself I am not ashamed anymore.

## 2016-07-06

I spent the night with her, like before. The guilt of a forbidden relationship was with me when we drove the school. We met Catherine. The class started and shit happened. We met outside and drove again, this time the three of us in the same car. We stopped outside my old house in Otay. She had vomit on her mouth and was unconscious. I wanted to wake her up so I called her name. "Mona" I said, "Mona"... But she wasn't Monica, she was Xennia.

In the house my father received us Luis and Miguel way younger than they are before. I knew I was in a dream and realized the unfamiliarity and nostalgia that seeing that place again woke up in me. When I saw the differences in everywhere and the animals I decided to wake up.

I got up from bed early in the morning. I heard my mother leave the house. I ate breakfast. Did I cook something or was it a bowl of cereal? None. I made myself a sandwich. It was more than I wanted and yet I finished. I didn't eat again until late in the afternoon when my mom came back with Chinese food from the River Plaza.

I showered and changed for therapy. I had no reason to hide anymore. I put on woman's jeans and a girl's blouse. I applied make up and thought I looked fine. The sunscreen burned the skin around my nose. Is it the changes in my skin, is it burn because of the sun or a reaction from the make up? I know there are changes, but why can't I see them?

I keep looking at the pictures of this saturday. There is a video where I am making faces at the camera besides Catherine. My face looks fine, my shoulders seem pale in the contrast with the fabric of the dress, the width of it makes them seem not as broad. We smile while this song plays in the background. The video lasts less than 5 seconds.

There are not many photos of me and I don't like most of them.

I left home an hour early because of the traffic. I was wearing a brown and loose shirt of Miguel. I parked where I usually do, in front of the elementary school where some girls saw me and Catherine walking from the Alitas restaurant and called us to say to the camera. It was empty again. I walked confidently. I don't feel nervous anymore. I was wearing the brown flats I bought last week.

When I passed the little cart that sells fruit and beverages he called to me "What can I offer you, [male] friend?". It was like a stab in the gut. I kept walking ignoring him. The reflection from the mirror in the building caught my attention and tried to console me as if it were saying: "look at me, look, you look fine".

I kept walking but my confidence stayed with the dirty fruits and melted ice.

In therapy I talked about last week. It started with the traffic and the closure of roads. Then I started with the lack of comments from my mother seeing me in her school. Luis and Miguel know about me and I narrated how I told them. Saturday I tried to tell both of my parents I intended to wear a dress. I wore it and my father saw me. I talked about Monica and why I feel the obsession of sending the friend request as if I want her to see me and notice how I have changed.

I talked about Catherine and how it hurts she hasn't changed. Ivan is still her boyfriend and her father waits for him. I want to publish the notice of my changes. I want to tell all my contacts that Ivan is gone, that I'm not him, I'm me. I want them to know I'm not the same, I'm not who they think. I want them to forget I ever was like that. I want them to come and accept me, to see their support and stop feeling alone.

Rene didn't say anything but I could sense he's not a fan of the idea. Earlier sessions he has made the comment about the difficulties I'll face and I should not rush into things. But it hurst being hidden. It's excruciating knowing I'm in the mouths of others, they see me in a dress but they see him and talk of him and miss him.

Who cares about me?

## 2016-07-07

I feel full, my stomach is filled with food. I ate the sandwich in the friday's, the restaurant that my family always chooses. Outside my room is my mother making a preachment about why she wants Luis to read his speech for her so she can record him and post it on Facebook. I, in his place, would hate that. I would hate my grandmother making the same questions over and over: "did you threw the paper of the speech? Did you? Uh? Did you threw it, son? Huh?"

Anyway, I am not in his place. I passed all that. My childhood is over. I'm no longer a child, a boy. Am I a woman, now? Was I ever a man?

The music is playing from the speakers. After finishing the words I'll change clothes and try doing the exercise. Today the cycles are shorter, but they're three now.

It was Luis graduation. Since long before today I knew I'd wear man's clothes. The plan was that I'd pick Catherine a little before 3 and we would meet them later in the school. It was all set. I was upset about the clothes I would wear. I hate them. I hate the idea of being seen as a man. I feel them like a disguise. I look disguised wearing something else.

Before showering and dressing myself, I asked my mother about what would happen today. She was getting ready for going to school. "At what time will you leave?" "After four" "How will you do it with Luis and everyone?" "I guess they will go with you"

Nobody said anything to me. I would have to accommodate myself to their plans. I was angry. I let it go.

In the restaurant she was saying something to my grandmother. Something about someone being un a bad mood. I asked about who. They didn't answer and made me realize I was the subject of their conversation. She started talking about today how I answered angrily to her when she asked me to take them. I couldn't take it. I opened up and told her my mind. I explained she didn't ask me but told me. It was because I asked her directly, had I not come to her, I would never knew.

I feel the waist of the pants constricting my stomach. I can hear my mother words to Luis behind the camera.

He won first prize from his group in both his normal classes and english class. He is the smartest one in there. He's like me, I'm proud.

"Tell me what are you expressing".


What is it that makes me mad about my mother's pictures? I know it's seeing myself in there, I know it's my grandmothers annoying insistence. But the artificiality of it. Repeating something for a fake memory. Seeing the set up for a void picture or video. I don't mind anybody taking pictures spontaneously about the things I do or happen. Is the asking me to repeat them, to fake them. The music the white paper behind, they insisting so they can share it to people who don't care.

I told Catherine I had the idea of changing therapists. No, it wasn't changing what I thought. It was leaving him. The reason I told her was that his doubts are worse than mine. "It will be hard, it will be complicated. I've told you. Don't rush things"

I had the initiative, the idea. I wanted to open up and tell everybody. He looked at me with a face of doubt and uncertainty. The worse could happen out of it. I need help and support. His doubts are not even free. Why should I pay somebody for having worse expectations than me? He gives me the idea of reluctancy out of my transition. Am I projecting my own uncertainty and doubts into him?

I don't want to go back to how I looked. The changes are minimal and barely noticeable to others beside me, and yet thinking about suspending the hormones and going back makes me afraid.

Everybody but my grandma knows. Everybody keeps calling me and referring me in the same way. I want to change this situation and then I think about telling everybody else.

I asked Catherine about what would she do in my place. She told me the same thing. She'd do it. Maybe she would say something before to her family.

After two or three takes, my mother is still angry. She tells him to go. I want to stand up and tell them to shut up. It's his right. I would not want it anyway.

Go fuck yourselves.



## 2016-07-08

A white sheet was floating in front of the open window. An illusion made by the current of wind, I thought. Its moves were elegant and rhythmic. It floated there, dancing in the empty air. A musical ghost. It died and fell to the floor as if someone had flicked the switch cutting its life support. The air must had stopped. Suddenly it revived and kept dancing a little far from its starting position. It moved faster and more energetic. The distance between us was getting shorter. It wasn't the air.

In another scene I remembered reading my mother's notes about the incident. As if I were her subject of study she narrated my reaction and behavior upon the sheets dancing, death and resurrection. She narrated in the feminine, though.

Another different scene after that one we were in the same room, sharing the same bed. I was lying with my head upon her lap. Her fingers caressed softly the insides of my curls. A soft voice sang to me in a musicality completely unfamiliar to my past. Her words were those of a lullaby sang filled with love from a mother's care to her daughter.

When I woke up I wasn't happy nor satisfied nor content. It wasn't love I felt nor care. Not even unreal or fantastic. I felt sorrow. Misery brought to me from my own unconscious desires and lacks.

I drove Luis to his school, his last party or reunion or whatever it was. He knows about me and that just makes it worse. Every Ivan burns as those scorching pinpricks of laser that make me flinch when the laser hits my face.

Today was the fourth session. After leaving him in school I drove myself to the place. In there, an unknown girl welcomed me. She didn't say nothing about the sunscreen nor my time from shaving. She told me I had finished with my paid sessions but I stayed quiet. This time was even shorter. I had forgotten to take the ibuprofen to mute the penetrating pulses of pain. It's supposed to be lower every session. The one before it's the one that has hurt the most. She warned me with an explanation that if I felt hotter or a little more painful it was because she upped the intensity so it would be quicker and more effective.

This time the machine don't stop a single time. It was a continue set of flashes and light and pain. It was over before I realized. The redness and swelling was more noticeable than other times, although it faded mostly by the time I got home. Miguel was already there. When we were eating he made some comments and jokes. It was like a try of getting closer, reaching for me.

Why do I feel the most distant I've ever felt to everybody?

I have this dark somberness inside of me. An ill mood that makes me just wish to crawl to bed and turn off al lights. I have things to wait for. Next week will be the pride parade. After that, 2 weeks later I'll be in another session of laser and then two after that I'll see the endocrinologist.

And then, just more waiting. Waiting to talk with my family, waiting to dare to send the message to Liliana, waiting for the medicines to bring me more obvious changes, waiting to reconcile with the reflection of the mirror, waiting for time to pass by and let me escape and be free.

I've run out of words and things to say and the counter is still low. I'm tired. I weighted more than the initial weight I had in the first session with the endocrinologist. I did the exercises of today. I did yesterday's after Luis' dinner in the Friday's.

My grandma called me daughter when she asked about my mom. She corrected herself almost instantly. She messes our names all the time, that she was thinking about my mother must not mean anything.

She hasn't returned from her school. After her turns she went to a meeting or reunion or party of hers. This one is in the house of her old principal.

50 more words and I can finish. I have no plans for the weekend. I should not waste money. I should keep it safe and unspent. I'll need it this weekend. Will my grandmother stay here? Has she noticed me?

Catherine told me today my ill sentiments towards her are obvious. Has she noted them?

Do I push her away from the fear of telling her and being rejected?

Is that what I do with everyone?

## 2016-07-09

I just ate and have no energy for doing the exercises. It's a quarter before 8 and I'm tired. I've spent most of t the day either in bed or in the couch. I slept with both my eyes open and shut. My brain has stayed both quiet and numb.

I read another chapter of the book. It's interesting, I like it. It's not enough to caught my attention. I watched a couple of episodes of the police show in Netflix but it's just white noise that helps me pass the time.

I think about tomorrow and next week. Another week that passed without news of Liliana. A therapy session that made me feel worse than when it started. A fourth laser session. The black spots are minimal. Three weeks after the last one. I hope it's effective.

Just after finishing this words I might try to do the exercise, from there I'll go to bed again, try to sleep.

Why do I want to sleep? Is it tiredness? Maybe it's just a wish for time to pass. I can't wait until I have something to do. I can't look for a job. I can, I don't want to. It's not that I don't want to work. I want to, I want to do something with my time. I don't want to send resumes with a picture of me and the name I don't want anyone to remember. How can I go to a interview dressed in a disguise hoping to be hired and asked to cut my hair, to wear the male uniform and meet several new people under an expedited name.

Next year I can start applying to the master. Yeah, I'll have interviews and the same resume. They'll meet me with that same old name, they'll review my application, my history. I'll have to travel again and show my id various times.

I feel hopeless and scared. I want time to pass. I wish I could change my name and papers and look normal. I wish I could be normal.

An afternoon in an androgynous attire was enough to shit on my mood.

My heart desires to escape, fly and run far away from here. Being somewhere else, someone else.

Will life be different? After I have the new name and identification and a birth certificate that corroborates my story, will things get better? Will I get a job and be able to sustain myself? When I was kid I found the idea impossible. As I've been growing it gets more and more difficult to see it as something achievable.

"Mom, don't even dig any more. The only thing that's left is that Jose Luis is my relative"

That would explain how I'm broken.

I hear them talking about stuff. How did people got to be? My father is now talking about the theory of evolution and he's being mocked. He is actually correct. Are they morons?

I feel like a teenager. This familiar feeling of being buried in my own room and self-pity, hating the world and myself, and feeling as the last sensible and perceptive person of the world. I was pathetic. I am ashamed of those days.

Why am I behaving in that same way?

Then I couldn't imagine a future in which I could ever be happy. I created a plausible outcome of a successful future based on everybody's expectations. A wife and a house and a career and maybe kids. Being a successful man would make me eventually a happy man.

I was wrong. I guess, I never got to be neither successful nor a man.

I'll never be a man, and I'm fine with that. Will I get to be successful? Is it possible?

I thought about adding Yadira in Facebook. Rene's comments made me think about being "active" and me sending the requests, waiting to be accepted or rejected.

No, actually he said to wait. Eventually people would notice me and add me, know me and look for me.

He, or his silence, has a point. Telling my contacts and waiting for them to add me is telling the world. Telling my close friends and far away relatives and barely acquaintances. They'll know and have a direct knowledge of where to find me and know about me.

But is waiting more direct and active? If I add Yadira she might never accept me, or even if she does, will we talk? Will I tell her? Will she know who am I?

I want people to see me. I can wait for them to recognize me or look for me or I can shout in their faces.

How can I shout if I don't even dare to whisper to the people who share a roof with me?

## 2016-07-10

Liliana called me first thing in the morning. My pits smell. I did the exercise and showered at noon. I guess the hormones have not changes my body odor yet. I went to the bathroom and put deodorant. As I took my shirt I glimpsed at my body. It's flabby and chubby. I was supposed to be losing weight.

So Liliana called me. It was a normal call, a phone call. I answered and she told me how Karla's mother had talked to her and told her that she's been having a kind of crisis, maybe a psychotic one.

I could had let it pass had I not applied the MMPI. Wow. Anyway, tomorrow is her session, so I could give her the results with her. She knows I wanted the both of us to review them, and she got sick and all that.

And then, unexpectedly I had something to do. I sent her the results. I reviewed them myself and the whole day spent redacting the conclusions. Just now I've finished and sent the report to the printer. Tomorrow I'll buy a folder on the way to the office.

Why did it lift my mood? I was like an old piece of shit, lying motionless in my bed stinking the whole bedroom. These past few days not even a conversation with Catherine could make me feel better.

I woke up early, a little past the call. I went to the living room and lied on the couch. The edge of the phone was on my lips and my sight was resting in the ceiling. I was disappointed, Lili had called and set up the meeting and I did not tell her. Tomorrow might be an opportunity. Catherine advised me how I could just wait until she mention a new patient and then I can tell her.

But is really that the best option? If she sends me a new patient she'll tell them my contact information, they look for me as Ivan the psychologist. I don't like introducing me that way.

Last thursday was excruciating wearing an androgynous attire, how am I going to go tomorrow?

The patient has not seen me in half a month. Lili a little more than that. She keeps calling me handsome boy. Do I want her to be incorrect? I wish she would see me and the compliment just doesn't fit.

I haven't shaved since Thursday. It's been three days. I should let my stubble. Shave it Wednesday. Feel the little black hairs shedding and falling out, seeing them dead in the palms of my hands and the tips of my fingers.

Four sessions.

What was it that made me see the chart of hormonal changes. The only one that start before the three months are erections and libido. Both of them are totally gone. The rest start by the 6th month. I'm not even half. Why am I so desperate?

Does Rene have a point?

Am I rushing into things?

Catherine said something about arranging her pictures from last year, from this one. I opened the application and reviewed some. The one where I go to Pockets and play with pool with them. I look hideous. How could I step outside looking like that? She told me how she found me really feminine in one picture. I look bloated and masculine broad face feminized in a mediocre attempt at make up.

I see some pictures of those times and I feel nauseous and disgusted. And yet I don't dare to delete them. I like seeing them and then browsing the next ones. I see them, the one when I went to the first appointment to the endocrinologist. Even before then. I dressed in a sweater and leggings and went to a restaurant in my birthday. I was seen and referred as a woman months before even starting hormones, hours before making the appointment. Then I have the other ones closer to the date. I'm in Catherine's bed, and the pills are over her sheets and I'm smiling and excited, minutes before being freaked out and scared about the dosages.

A couple of days later I go to the ceremony where I receive the first Scholar mention, or was it the Egel? The first month, then the second in Guadalajara, dressed as a boy and later that day, still with male clothes look androgynous enough to be seen as a woman.

Today Johanna liked three of my pictures in Facebook. She got into my profile.

I had given up on her.

I gave up on her and she came back.

She came back.

## 2016-07-11

I had the session, the last one with the last patient. We sat in a room the four of us, Liliana by my side and the patient and her mother in front of us. I was nervous. I printed the report since yesterday. It was stapled over my desk waiting.

Did I dream something today? What times was it when I woke up? I got up from bed. I ate breakfast. The biscuit from Saturday. Today is monday. Tomorrow I have the whole day for myself. I have no work, no to dos left. I'm free. This wednesday I'll see Rene and I don't know what I'll say.

The last messages I sent Catherine was about this house. She asked me if I haven't talked with Luis about how I feel when he calls me Ivan. I haven't. There is no point. Yesterday we talked about Liliana. If I tell her I have doubts she'll ask me what I want to do. Do I want to start seeing patients as Sofia? Do I want her to keep sending me patients? It's similar with Luis. What's the point of telling him I'm hurt every time he calls me by my former name. Do I want him to call me differently? What will he do when our grandma is nearby?

"This is not my house. This is Ivan's home."

I showered and changed. I wasn't going to shave. There were noticeable and thick black hairs in the sides of my chin. Just there. Some shorter ones spread on a tiny patch in my cheeks. And that was it. I could had left them be. But they looked weird. I sent a picture to Catherine and her opinion was tu cut them, too. I used the machine. I left home by one.

I stayed in my car half an hour until the meeting hour. I read the conclusions of the report to familiarize myself with it. The mother arrived close to me. She walked towards Lili office and kept walking. I went to the other corner of the second floor. Liliana arrived a couple of minutes after two. We waited a little until the patient came.

And then it was just results. I explained and exposed. I taught and clarified. I gave examples and I finished. The patient confirmed most of the things I had to say. "Yeah, yeah" "Have you felt like this?" "On occasions" She cried. It's scary to hear schizophrenia and paranoia. I know it is. I was scared myself.

I got paid and left. We talked for three minutes and that was it. I made no mention of my situation. She gave them the contact of the psychiatrist. Dr Maldonado, like my father.

"Maldonado, right?" confirmed the mother. "Yeah", I told her before Lili.

"No... Oh wait, yeah, Maldonado. Magallanes is my doctor, Maldonado is my son's."

She goes to the same doctor as I do. I could had said something, but I did not.

I was bored home when I scrolled on facebook. My contacts are way less than in the other account.

I changed to the other profile and looked at the new things. Then it appeared. Monica Gonzales. Why did she came up? This time she was with Moncayo. Yesterday. They went to a bar. Diana and Rafa were there, too.

Some contact of Omar thought of them as a couple. She wore make up. Heavier than other times. She was wearing when we met outside the movies, too. How embarrassing that your exboyfriend wears more make up than you, it's almost as "seeing that a tranny looks better than you".

I don't know, and can't know that she put it because she saw me. Probably it's not. Why would she? It's just like imagining them asking Monica how and why and when did we break up. She has more than a year with her boyfriend. They have no reason to mention me in their catching up. They don't even remember me, why would they think of me?

Because somebody might have seen the profile and the picture.

I don't know and probably never won't.

It's absurd. I wanted to make it public, post it somewhere everyone could see so I could avoid this, people talking behind my back, asking questions, making assumptions. Posting it won't solve that, that could it even make it worse.

Do I want to cause it?

I kept mocking Luis today about his nipples slipping out of his tank. He answered back that at least his wouldn't be censored in a picture.

Did he say that on purpose referring to mine or was he making a point about the situation with trans' nipples?

Sometimes I think I overestimate him.

## 2016-07-12

There is a lot of shit in my bed. Lots and lots of mementos and cards and bags and stuff. I took down everything from the shelves and the upper side of the bookcase and the boxes from over my closet. There is a white bag filled with trash. I took pictures from jr highschool and threw them away. I took the pages off the notebook of signatures from grade school. All the box of childhood memories is inside the bag of jr high school pictures. I put lots of the memories of university in a box and left it for later to clean. As I took the childhood memories I shared what was inside with Catherine. Snapshots of the pictures, and the toys and audios of me narrating the days from when I was seven years old.

The year 2k. Fifteen years ago. I noticed the immatureness and the innocence and the excitement of childhood. I wish I could go back in time and see him. I remember being a little boy and picturing myself as a grown up. I didn't know why but I was sure I'd wear glasses. Did I see me with long or shorter hair? Would I recognize me? Would I think I look girly?

How would I react were I to see me dressed femininely. "Who's that woman? ...Am I her? But how?"

Would I be scared or relieved?

I could imagine lots and lots of things, maybe I could be close to guessing my profession. Psychologist, applying psychometric tests, using math to evaluate people's personalities and mental quirks. Studying the brain, yeah.

Would I be proud that I've gotten over my fear of needles? Would I be ashamed that I take hormones so I look like a girl?

I opened Monica's box. Catherine told me it was fine and I could share its insides as well. I started taking a picture of everything, there were postcards of the ship in LA and from the Beatles Laser show. Inside was a cigar box of Abbey Road. In there a little red ribbon and a note. I thought it was too personal to share its contents. I read it.

"My Ivan..." she told me how she loved me and explained the little gifts. In there was the hair pins of her childhood and the cigar box and the pajama string from the first time we chatted on the phone. Where did I left it? I think I threw it away. I turn my head and look at the night light and the cords that are tied on it. I looked for that blue string but it's not there. Why do I want it? Why do I want to remember? Why do I feel like it's something forbidden?

I told Catherine that I could not. The letter was from before I left to Spain. Was it before or after we were to the hotel and I received the notification of the visa? Was it before or after I broke up with her over the phone?

I cried but it wasn't because of the content. I told Catherine that I had decided to threw away the whole box. Was I lying or did I change my mind? Why did I put it away?

I keep thinking about that blue string. I threw away her blue bra and the hair pins, I shredded to pieces the drawing I made her years ago. Why is that string more important?

I had an insight. We chatted a little about the exes. I did tell Catherine I wished she had exes experiences like mine. It came back today. It's true, my problems with Monica are not because she's my ex. It's more complicated than that.

And it came, and with the realization came the gut punch that brought me to tears.

I don't hate her because of our relationship or its ending. I don't mind the lack of affection or intimacy, I don't care about stupid breaks or even what happened when she left the first time to Mexico. I've gotten all that.

I'm not even mad about her leaving and rejection. It's not our friendship that I mourn. It's that she's gone and she never forgave me.

I cheated in my own kind of way with both of them. I asked her if she could love me, accept me and she did not know. She was hesitant to the idea. "I don't know, I can't answer, I can't say. I'm scared that I'll say yes and then I won't feel the same or that I'll say no and realize the mistake I made." She wasn't sure I would be me.

I went to Spain and when I returned I betrayed her, I made her think I was still Ivan. Like the shot I repaired today, I came broken and in pieces. As I put myself back up, there are pieces missing.

And then, a semester later, Ivan was gone. Ivan was dead. I took her lover away from her, the man she had planned a life with and who would always love, her best friend. He's gone because of me and we never talked about it. I realized it in january, a year after my departure. She was gone by then, she had abandoned me like she promised she would not do. She stayed in France for half a year and we kept talking, sometimes, pretending it was all the same and I had not changed.

When she returned we did not meet. And I was angry at her, because I could not deal being angry at me for what I had done. And then the silences began. I was guilty and she was distant. Until she left for good. Until she told me directly how she could not be my friend and left.

She loved him, she promised him love and hates me.

Is that why I am scared of my parents? I took her lover away. What will happen when I take my family's son and brother? Will they hate me, too?

Is that why I can't deal with them seeing me?

## 2016-07-13

Catherine's new profile picture is an hour old and has 18 likes. 18 people have seen it and clicked a button to express their approval. It means nothing, it's worth nothing. It's not something material, just an abstract quantification, a number.

I talked to Rene. I picked Catherine from her house.

Don't know why, but I just came from walking upstairs looking for a pair of double A batteries. I put them in the white dog that dances to music. It's yellow now after the years it lied out of use. Is it dead?

"I travelled the world looking to find myself. In my search I ended up shattered and broken.
After time I decided to pick up the pieces. The missing fragments are part of my history, of who I am."

I thought about posting the pictures of the broken shot glass, and those could be the words to accompany them. What's the point if no one will see?

Since yesterday we talked about going to the park. I picked her up and drove us to my session. We parked outside the grade school. We walked and I held her hand. I know it makes her uncomfortable, I know she gets nervous and feels exposed. Is that why I do it? Do I want her to feel how I feel? Is it on purpose?

In our way we stopped in food garden. We bought a big cup of thai tea. She ordered it. Nobody looked at us. They let us be.

We stayed the rest of out extra time outside the building, seated, talking, smiling.

"Does it bother you that I play pokemon, too?", I told her the truth, I feel similarly to Anahi. When we talked with her, I felt letdown. She talks about those same people who mocked her because of playing videogames are now posting images of themselves with that stupid game. She hasn't even played pokemon.

I remember those times when I was 6 or 7 years old. Edgar had a gameboy pocket. He bought the blue version of the game, the one with Blastoise, the big turtle with cannons on his shoulders. I played that game. Didn't really understood it, but I played it. I ended up owning it years later with a bunch of other games. Outside the CECUT we dad parked the van and when we returned somebody stole my backpack with toys and the game boy.

I talked with Rene, but felt no point. He made no comment that I couldn't had realized myself. Should I really keep going? Yeah. I'm on medication. He is supervising it. He has helped me.

"How can she be friends with the woman who took Ivan from her"

Was that what hurt me or his worry that a potential patient could feel let down because he was told he would meet with the psychologist Sofia.

I cried. I ought to bring the count to 0 again.

We drove directly to the park after that. We were alone for a couple of minutes until Anahi caught up with us. Her bra was really small, I thought I could see her nipple through her blouse but doubted about saying something.

We ate the sandwiches Catherine made and the chips I took from home. I took pictures with my phone and Anahi's. I asked her for the code so I could see them. She told me she had deleted them already. Maybe she was just messing around. I tried putting the code but ended up blocking it. A minute of waiting until a next try. She put the code wrongly and the wait was for five minutes. When I mentioned it again, she got it wrong again on purpose, the wait was 15 minutes. I was sad and mad, I was upset.

I said no other word about it, and let the day continued as if nothing had happened.

I hate that kind of fellowship. It's not fun, it's hurtful. I don't really want those kind of friends.

They talked about Catherine's new job, the application, the process. Anahi's new studies. She could get a technical certification. Catherine thought about it. What if I don't get into the master? "Would you get upset if I after not getting I decide to stay here?"

"No, I mean, yeah, but you can totally do that."

But did I mean it?

Even now I'm worried. I'll end up alone, just as I feared. Without a home nor a therapist nor a endocrinologist.

I won't have any help, any family, any friend.

I'll be totally alone in a place where absolutely not a single person will know my legal name or my story.

Isn't that what I want?

## 2016-07-14

I cried yesterday like I've not cried in years. Tears drowned my face, the sorrow wrapped my throat and held me to bed.

What was it that we talked about?

It al started with a simple phrase: "I'm a little sad because of everything". Everything was 5 things, now I can't even remember them. Catherine tried to make me feel better but it was counterproductive. Was it an argument, a fight?

We both were crying. We explained and I talked why I think telling the things and emotions are a mistake. Opening up doesn't help. I expose myself and wear my own vulnerability and it doesn't change a thing. I don't feel better but worse.

I can't remember the last things we talked about. Pictures, Anahi, the capital. I feel lonely and invisible. I keep hiding myself even though I don't really want to. I try to fool myself into thinking there is no longer any feeling of shame inside of me.

Yesterday when I returned I put my hoodie before entering the door. I covered the little and barely noticeable breasts that protruded from the blouse. Tiny and sensible plums underneath my nipples. My mother asked me to pick Luis and my grandma up from school today. She would leave them by 9, the time the meeting was supposed to start, I could pick them up at 10. When they were finished they would go buy tacos and I'd look for them there.

Then the night came and Catherine and I cried under the silence of the moon.

By 2 in the morning we stop sharing messages. I don't recall the time I finally went to sleep. Did I hear something? I think I sent Catherine a message telling her both my mom and grandma were speaking loudly.

I got up earlier than I had to. I didn't shower, I just put jeans and went. I could meet them earlier. I could eat with them freshly or just come home. I left closer to 9 than 10. I arrived a quarter before the hour. There was nobody. Sure, they could be waiting inside.

I put gas before leaving. The dispatcher didn't welcomed me in a gender way. I looked androgynous enough to be met with ambiguity. I put 100.

I still felt the sadness from the night. I was tired and miserable. I ate the burrito that was in the table but waited until coming back to take the hormones.

I was upset and annoyed by having to wait for them. I moved the car like 5 times. I parked in front of the school, in front of the taco cart and then the school again, and then nearby. Finally I stopped and waited a little before entering the principal offices. I looked Luis going out from the door and our grandmother following him. I opened the door and let them in. "Have you been here for long?"

"Like an hour" I exaggerated a little rounding up. It was a muted tone of voice, not really angry, just tired. Exhausted. Had I any emotion in me left? My grandmother explained and try to make smalltalk along the way home. I didn't shut her off, but not really continued it. I speeded a little out of frustration. I was caught in the inside of the roundabout and got stuck behind slow cars in the highway.

When home I did not say a word. I took my pills and went back to bed. I cried several times today.

I opened Monica's box that I was letting for later. More than half of its contents I threw away. I kept the notes and important mementos and, apart, the things she could want back or I would feel guilty throwing to the trash.

I cried reading the letters. Her love, how she would always be mine, there was nothing that could set us apart. I was that nothing. I took her lover away and killed him. I murdered him in Spain and came in his place. He was more feminine than when I pretended to be him. Did she notice the difference? Was I convincing? Did she come better with me than with him?

Catherine told me that it's something that could not be avoided. I did what I had to do. I could not pretend to be him forever. I would be unhappy, it would not be my life. I'd be dead.

I kept the items as if there is still a chance of seeing her again.

Am I optimistic or just a fool?

## 2016-07-15

30 days again.

Today was a calm and silent day. I did shower for a change and did my exercises, too.

I finished sorting out the boxes of mementos and the drawer with the stuff. My clothes are ready for tomorrow. I am excited and nervous. We talked about how we would do it. Catherine will pick me up early and drove the both of us to find parking near the border. We'll look for a pot near the new border crossing. After getting to the other side, we'll make a stop in the carl's jr where Anahi works. She will leave her job application, no, she'll ask for one. Anahi forgot hers before leaving.

I'm supposed to wake up by 5 in the morning. I'll shower and shave my face and comb my hair. I'll dress up and maybe apply some of my face before waiting her to come.

I keep thinking about adding Monica, sending her the request and just waiting. But waiting for what, exactly? She could either accept it or not. And if she does? Would I send her a message? Would I look for news about her? Do I want her to see my posts?

I've been thinking about apologizing. Asking if she resents me. Offering to give her her stuff back.

I feel like a pushover, insignificant. It's a mixture of both feeling like a monster and the victim. I pity her and hate her.

She promised me to stay and left, she promised me support and bailed. I made her fall in love with a lie. I took away the man she dreamed a future with.

I told my parents about going out tomorrow but did not say where. My grandma gave me the earrings and the bracelet for Catherine. She asked for the ring but I didn't give it back. I made like I was looking for it but she did not wait.

She asked Miguel if he had someone, too, a girlfriend. I have a girlfriend but I am nobody's boyfriend. I am not a boy.

How many times do I have to type it before I truly believe it?

A year ago I went scared about wearing jeggings and a blouse, tomorrow I'll cross wearing leggings and a blouse under my shirt. That's my "boymode" I'll took off the shirt, put the white dress I bought and then loose the leggings.

I hope I look drastically different to me from a year ago. I hope people gender me feminine and it doesn't surprise me. I hope I no longer feel nervousness riding the bus nor the trolley.

Will I take pictures with my phone or will I take the camera? Will I post them? Will I share them?

My aunts might see them if I post them in snapchat. Distant friends might, too.

I no longer care. Yesterday I thought about posting it on Facebook. Talking with Catherine we both came to the same conclusion that I am not really ready. I hesitate before entering home dressing some ways. Even now I haven't considered how will I return home. I'll leave it wearing an androgynous outfit, but I'll came back wearing the dress. My father has seen me in a different one, Luis as well. My mother should be the person whom I should be less nervous about. Miguel I know I don't mind. It's my grandmother whom I hesitate about.

Catherine will bring be back. I'll open the door with both a rainbow and a trans bracelet. A bag and maybe bags with rainbow stuff. Will I be wet like last year? Will I be smiling or upset? Will something happen?

Why should I worry? Lots of things could happen. Last year there were people on the trolley harassing and talking about god and sexual sins. Do I want them to come to me and screamed at our faces? Tell me I'm an abomination and our love is something to be ashamed of?

I don't expect Catherine to speak up. Would I?

I want to. I want to defend our love. Telling them it's not of their business. But what if it's me who they attack? What if my voice betrays me and get called a faggot or a failed man or a tranny.

Would I dare to open my mouth?

Nothing might happen.

But shit might, too.

Maybe in the pride, like Catherine's scared of. Maybe on the crossing or at Anahi's job. Maybe in the festival or on our way home. Maybe home.

Would I dare face them dressed like that? Would I dare confront my grandmother and explain? I went to the pride parade. I am not really gay, but yeah, kind of. I'm with Catherine, and we're both women. You see, I'm trans.

I am trans.

I am trans and should not be ashamed.

I hope some day I get to feel proud.

## 2016-07-16

Okay let's try this I've written the words before in both my tablet and my phone now I'm not writing at all I'm dictating the words and my tablet is writing them down this is supposed to be faster than other ways I think I'm getting the hang of it no nevermind I keep saying words and words and sure the tablet writes them down but it's mistaken several times it's a chore going back and correcting it myself sure I mean my laptop is updating to a new software I was going to write them down on this tablet and I thought about trying this new software and here I am lying in my bed saying words and seeing them appearing into white screen today was Pride Catherine was with me the whole day it was fun I enjoy it mostly I'm really tired I guess I should begin writing now it was a nice exercise to realize how good my pronunciation in English is.

Yeah that's enough. I'll write normally now.

We both woke up by 5 in the morning. The sun wasn't even thinking about showing. Everything was dark and quiet and we started before the day.
She picked me up quicker than I expected. I was wearing the leggings and a white blouse under the denim shirt. I put the sunscreen on my face after getting my head right. The minutes before Catherine's arrival I finished giving colour to my face. Just smoothening it a little amount.

I was way less nervous than last year. We found parking easily near the new border crossing. I changed a thousand pesos to dollars. I don't really know how I looked.

The first words Catherine said to me as I got in her car were: "you look so girly"

We got to the bridge in the river. It was barely standing. A couple o aluminum platforms bridged until the start of the building receiving the peatons from Mexico.

There was almost no line. I could count easily the people in front of us. The cbp closest to the door was asking the guy to lift his shirt and turn around. It got me scared. What would happen when they see my name?

It was my turn. He asked me where I was going and I told the truth. San Diego, what was I going to do in San Diego? Well, going to balboa Park.

"are you JosÃ© IvÃ¡n?" "Yeah", I answered again saying the truth without bring totally frank. "ok, have fun, man"

I have the picture we took of us crossing the new border entry. I don't look as feminine as I thought. Yeah, I looked girly but it wasn't unbelievable that I were a boy.

First we went to Anahi's work. We crossed a couple of minutes shy of 7 and got there a couple after eight. Anahi made my breakfast burger and put extra hashbrowns in it. She took her 10 minutes break to chat with us. Catherine filled her job application. I went to the bathroom to change. I put the shirt over the thing with the toilet paper. I hesitated before putting my bag on the ground. I took the dress and put them over my head and shoulders. The leggings were the last to go. I put on the shirt and exited. There was voices, a woman and a child. One of them inside the cubicle, the words were as if there was something between them. I was out and nervous. I looked at her directly in the eyes when I walked towards the sink.

I forgot if there was a mirror or not. We went to Wal mart, she bought a cable for her phone and I, a replacement to my mascara.

The bathrooms were closed and there was no small mirrors.

I put the rest of my make up outside in the bus stop. We got to university Ave just as the parade was starting. The "dykes on bikes" were passing by with a rainbow-colored cloud of smoke following them.

We walked to find good places. Some people arrived and moved closer and closer to the street covering the view. Catherine seemed tired and in a bad mood. I asked her to move but she said no. I moved a couple of times to take pictures. I finally found a better place and told her I would be over there. She came some time later. She was upset and cried a little. She later would tell me she felt out of place. I remember Anahi's words. I understand here. They're proud and celebrating and dancing and cheering.

She barely accepts she's bi. She's still nervous about being seen with me holding hands. She hasn't told her father.

Gladly she felt a little better as the day passed. We got some free stuff. The booth of the sex toys was different this time. Now the gifts were cheaper and just one slot of the roulette gave a toy.

We both ended getting one. Several times did people referred to us as ladies.

At first it was hurting waving and feeling ignored. It wasn't until later that I could see them starting waving back after meeting my sight.

"Bang them, sister!" one of the men said after I waved at him. When I did, he cheered.

Later, getting to the festival we met the black man who danced over a truck. He smiled at me and I waved again. He exclaimed "I really like that girl!"

There were two people manifesting about religion. A couple of men confronted them one hugged him and the other asked him what Love meant.

He came to us to tell â€œHe told me Jesus didn't love me, can you believe it? I told him he loves everyone. How could he not love me when he made me this fabulous?"

I returned in a dress, nervous and afraid. I heard the TV when I turned the key and opened the door. My parents my brothers, my grandmother. I didn't know what to expect. The living room was empty.

Was it a victory or a disappointment?



## 2016-07-17

I am not going to do any exercise today. Yesterday I walked close to 10 kilometers. My shoulders are red and furious. My face is reddened and sore. Even raising my arm constricts the swollen skin on the shoulder and it screams in pain. Lying on my side is excruciating, stomach-down, I tend to use my arms as a support to my head, so unconsciously lifting them is a source of discomfort. Sleeping on my back is my least favorite way to rest and now my only option.

I returned to bed after breakfast. I slept two or three hours passing noon. Yesterday I ate not much, today I took what I left the day before. I took the usual biscuit, then four cookies. I ate what was left of my bowl and a sandwich, in the evening I finished with a steak sandwich.

I drank mostly water but still is a lot of food.

I feel tired. Tomorrow I think I'll send a message to Liliana. Rene is pressuring me subtly to do it. I want to, anyway.

If she asks me, will I let her present to me as Sofia? The pride was a confident booster, but am I ready? Do I pass? Has she forgotten? Of course not.

We accorded to see the last episode of Orange is the new black in Catherine's house tomorrow. She proposed it. I had the idea it was me who asked her not to go to her house. Stopped being seen as Ivan and called in the masculine.

My mother asked my opinion about what Luis said to his female friend about her bathing suit. Was it because I studied psychology or because she saw me as a woman, too?

Will I dare to correct them or show myself?

I was going to, I did enter to the house in the dress. I did not know the living room was going to be empty.

Will I see my patients in dresses or jeans and blouses? I have the full black bag of clothes still in the room next to mine. My closet is less filled. My formal clothes are in my mother's closet and I don't pretend to wear them anymore. There is no point in taking them to the laundry.

I thought about telling them of the graduation. Reminding them that I have to buy what I'm going to wear. I don't even consider going in a suit.

"The graduation I'm invited to will be in September, I have to buy what I'm going to wear" "What will you wear, a suit?", I guess they're going to ask.

"I won't wear another suit in my life" I said to the imaginary conversation playing inside my head.

Yesterday Luis set up his phone and I put in there the numbers of both my mom and dad. When I put mine, I hesitated when filling the information. What's my name? He knows. Why couldn't I just type it?

What's stopping me? From where does the shame keeps coming?

Of what am I ashamed? I am a woman, I am starting to look like one. I am comfortable when people see me and treat me as one. Why do I fear being denied when nobody has done it?

Again I hesitated before posting the status update. I thought about posting more pictures about the parade and the festival. Ones with Catherine and me, hugging and smiling and making faces and having fun.

I'm proud of her. I used to think I'd leave the Facebook without a trace of my history as a trans person. And then again I keep going back to the idea of linking it to the previous profile or posting the picture with me and the trans bracelet.

When I told Catherine about my hesitation she asked me if it was because of her. I lied and told her no. It's true that I have other reasons. Why couldn't I say how much it hurt me that she denies me?

She's ashamed of me. I am, too, so I don't think I can blame her.

She invited me to her home and I'm nervous about being seen by her parents. Her mother's denial and her father's obliviousness. Is he, though? Does he really not know?

Will he ask me personally why did I stop going? Will he make a comment about my recent absence?

How will I react when I hear that name, when I'm referred mistakenly?

Do I have a right to be upset when even in my own home I'm unknown?

## 2016-07-18

I was mistaken for my mother in the phone again. This time it was laughed about and shared with my grandmother later on the phone as I passed it. Minutes later she would tell my mom about it. "What was it that she said to you? 'Hello, lady"? " She did not such thing. She said hello in a knowing sing-y tone and I asked with whom she wanted to speak. Then she realized I was not Laura.

She's gone. She left because she has an appointment tomorrow, maybe? I could now post it and don't worry about her comments. I can leave home in a dress or whatever outfit I desire. I don't have to worry anymore about whom I find as I open the front door. Now everyone in this home know about me.

I closed Facebook. Since the start of the day I checked the status of the pictures updating and all. In dropbox just the video is missing. I uploaded some of the favorite pictures of the parade to Facebook. It was a gut punch when the option of tagging people came. I asked Catherine before, if she would be upset about me posting the one where we kissed. I remember my last relationship and Monica's reluctance to publish our relationship status in there. This is different. Her parents doesn't know we're a couple. They don't know me. Her mother does, it's just her father.

To him she's Ivan's girlfriend.

But that was not the suckerpunch I was referring about. Yeah, the option appeared again when I hovered the mouse over her face. Did I want to tag Catherine Rodriguez?, a little pop up window would say. It recognized her picture and proposed the idea. Facebook is a tattle tale and an ignorant. It doesn't know the problems and complications about our family and my own identity. That's why when I hovered my own face it asked me if I wanted to tag Ivan to the pictures. It doesn't know we're not the same person. That I'm not him. It just sees the face and thinks we share it. Will people think that, too?

I was hesitant about posting them. Yeah, it's hard. It's painful the feeling about doubting showing myself and then just realizing nobody notices. I posted a picture months before and it stayed ignored and unseen. Would this happen again? Would it be coming back from the pride with knots in my stomach and my trembling swallowed feet as I opened the door expecting judging and confused eyes upon me just to be met with an alone tv preaching to an empty room.

Minutes, no, fractions of one barely passed before the first notification appeared. Jhonny had liked the album, when he started reacting to the pictures I closed the tab. Will I react the same way when I finally post the status in Ivan's profile?

I have Rene's words in my ears. Both about the status update and Liliana. It's just two days before I see him again. Today I sent Liliana the text message telling her I want to talk to her, asking her for a free time she has in the week so I can meet with her. I confessed it was about the patients but it was something personal I wanted to talk about in person and not by the phone.

The message was sent around noon. She saw it an hour, maybe after that. It's still unanswered. She's busy, I know. She has a filled schedule, I know that, too. If tomorrow or the day after I don't get a response I might send her a voice message.

I won't need to, after all. She just answered and my stomach is knotting again, converging into itself, growling. I'm both nervous and relieved.

I just accepted the proposal and confirmed. Tomorrow by three I'll see her in her office.

I will go. What will I wear? "Hello, my handsome boy" Will that be the last time she says that?

Should I go androgynous or complete feminine? I don't think I'm ready to wear make up just now.

How will I say it?

She'll say hi and kiss my cheek and invite me to enter, I guess. And then? Will I start just then? will I hesitate?

"Yeah, I've been meaning to say it, but it's hard. I know you've been busy and we haven't had much time. You know about me, I'm not a boy, nor Ivan. I am trans. And that's the thing. I don't know what to do...

When I started I really doubted what to do and how, the first patient knew me as Ivan and I thought that was going to be it, you know? It was settled. Professionally I could still be him at least until I left to the capital and continue with my transition and change my papers and all that, sure it would be hard, but doable.

But that's the thing. Since then, I've started transition. I've had 4 laser sessions in my face. I've been in hormones for almost three months. The changes are not really obvious yet, but yeah, I don't know if I'll be able to hide them for long.

And it really scares me. I don't know what to do. I don't have much experience with patients and I'm lost with my situation.

Will I be ready to present myself as who I really am? Will they respect me? Will it be impossible or difficult?

I know how I look, and that's why the urgency of saying it. But I don't know how I'm seen or how I will be."

## 2016-07-19

There are red tiny little dots in my upper arms. It's not a stinging pain, just an uncomfortable reminder of my sun poisoning. It's fading, I guess.

I went to Liliana's office and talked. I waited until time let me in. A couple of minutes after three, she opened the door to go to the bathroom and I waited standing. I was talking with Catherine on whatsapp. I was pretty nervous. Not like before entering my parents' bedroom with the plaque or when I was trapped in my bedroom wearing the blue dress.

It's not pain, it's itching. I want to pass my hand over the skin and calm the sensation. Tell myself "Yes, I know... what can I do?". Scratching hurts me, it brings me pain and yet doing it is something uncontrollable. I can't avoid it. I know it's bad, I know I'll regret it. And yet I stopped typing and take both my hands to my arms and dig my pointy nails into the skin.

Claudia added me to Facebook. She's Anahi's friends. She is Fernando's ex-girlfriend. I accepted her. Maybe it was the comment I made in Anahi's post about pokemon go in Sea World.

She sent me a text message: did I make another facebook or had she not added me before? She was confused.

Was her confusion about not having me in her friend list or because of my pictures and name? I answered her implicit question. It's a new facebook, it's me, I'm trans.

Moments after that was when Liliana came to the door and let me in.

After talking with her I stopped in the bakery. I bought three pieces of sweet bread. One sugary pastry of twisted donut, and two biscuits. I ate one and give the donut to Luis. I just took one bit. Before me entered a woman and a little girl. She was young and cute, a small child of no more than 4. She looked at me more than the woman, she looked and turned again. Was it my hair or my body? What was it that she saw?

I had tried gone femininely to Liliana. I wore the shorts I bought with Catherine and one of the tanks from Target. Over it I had the long black sweater covering my reddened shoulders from the sun. When the woman finished paying the man behind the cashier extended my hand asking for my platter. I lend it to him and waited for the woman and child the leave. He said: "it's 30, miss"

I smiled and thanked him. Two coins for my jar. I paid with the rest of the money my mother gave to me for bringing ice. She gave me 300 pesos. 100 went to my phone.

With Liliana I said it. I told her my worry and uneasiness. I told her I've started treatment. I've started changing. I'm unsure of how to present myself and show myself. I cried when I expressed my doubt of being "ready" to be seen as a girl.

It was reassuring and comforting. I've done it and I can tell Rene tomorrow.

I even talked about my thoughts of posting it on Facebook. She gave me the idea I had flirted with about sending a private message to certain contacts. Just a few of the closest ones, the ones I wish them to know, and tell them and give the info about the new profile. At first I thought it was the answer to the problem, yet coming home I came back to square one.

Where would I draw the line. Catherine asked me if the action of selecting a few would mean rejection when their lack of answer would seem apparent. It wasn't though.

Catherine told her father. He was going to the bathroom and she asked him if he was going to take a bath. "Yeah, why, do you want to chat?" She was just about to tell him to no, and go to the bathroom, when she finally took the chance. She started with and introduction to the conversations they've had. Then she told her secret. Later she would tell mine. He took it better than her mom.

It's done, she's said it. She's not rested, though. It's as if things are left to say, secrets still kept.

I found her words familiar. After my mom was my dad. Then it was a matter of telling my brothers. When I did, it was about being seen and when I showed myself it's about telling the world.

Is that why I want to tell everyone?

Where would I draw the line. From whom do I want to keep the information? Why? Why do I feel like hiding it still?

## 2016-07-20

"Your mouth looks very red", she was just coming down the stairs and stopped in the opening mid-floor just behind the television. I had my legs crossed under me in the sofa and was sitting next to Luis. Silently I nodded my head with shyness. Everyone in the house had seen me before. My father came outside to move the pick-up after Miguel opened the curtains and saw me park. Luis was sitting in the couch and Miguel at the table. Nobody said anything.

I showed Luis the video of me in Argana blowing smoke out of my red lips. The white shirt that covered my dress was beside me.

What was I wearing when they left to Costco?

I had taken a picture to ask Catherine what shoes to wear. My legs were covered in black leggings and over I had the pink tank. I could either wear the red shirt with squares or the white one with gray stripes.

I was asking about the shoes. I had decided about wearing the white one. She told me she thought I was going to wear the white blouse. After a series of misunderstood messages I ended up changing the tank for the creamy blouse I bought but never worn. Over it I wore the white shirt.

And then I left. I drove to Rene's and parked in the lot next to my highschool. With Rene I spoke securely about what has happened. I shared my own interpretation of the need to shared it on Facebook. I had thought about posting it today. Entering the session and just tell him "I've done it".

My mother hasn't seen me in a dress. She noticed my red lips today. Was she making a comment because she dares to notice, to talk about it? My dad doesn't, then? Does he see?

I can tell them. I'm scared about what they will say. I have a full black thrash bag with the clothes I will no longer wear. They don't either fit or they are way too manly for me to feel comfortable in. It's not just me. Yeah, I hate looking like a man, but when I go out in "normal" clothes, is when people stare and get confused or noticeably uncomfortable. They only time people have mocked me is when I was wearing man's clothes.

When I go out in female clothes or wear make up, it's like I turn invisible, no, they notice me, but I look normal. People smile more, look more calm or apathetic. They don't hesitate nor get uncomfortable when they have to address me. I mean, yeah, I've been harassed, too, I guess, but for being a woman, not for being trans. I've gotten catcalled, but who hasn't.

Would I really dare to say that?

That's the reason. I feel more comfortable, I feel amazing when I get validated by strangers. Months ago I was terrified of even driving female clothes. Now, I prefer it.

I've talked with my boss, the psychologist. The next patients I treat, they'll be referred to Sofia, not Ivan. I'll see them as a woman. I'm nervous, but I want to. It was my decision.

"Tomorrow I'll post the status on Facebook" Just now I write that to Catherine. She put a smiley face. Her parents know, now. Yeah, her uncles and aunts don't, and neither her grand parents.

I will tell her, to tell her parents about my name. I don't want her to refer to me as Ivan. Will I correct Luis, too? Will I let my mother ask me? Am I going to accept her offering or will I ask it to them? Is my dad going to answer with a silent face of disapproval?

Will it be hard for them? For me?

After my session Catherine met me outside the Oxxo. She told me my breasts looked bigger. Later she would add they bounced as I walked. We drove to the beach. We stayed a little in the park and played pokemon. In Argana we ordered food and a pipe. We saw the last episode of OITNB. We were received as ladies. The whole days was that how we were seen. Just once a man kept looking straight at me as he passed me. Did he clock me? Did he see through the make up? Is there something to see?

I'm wearing a trans bracelet. I'm not hiding it. I'm sick of hiding and keeping secrets. Yeah, I'm a woman, and yes, I am trans.

I think this is the first time I might actually believe I'm not ashamed anymore.



## 2016-07-21

I'm thinking about posting it. Making it public, coming out in all the senses of the word. I'm really thinking about it, considering, seeing all the consequences and possibles outcomes, both positive and negative.

What would happen here, home? Everybody knows but nobody says a thing. My mother is the only ones who dares to speak about it, not even me.

Mexicali? Would Cande see it or Edgar would tell her first? What would my uncles and aunts reactions would be? Both my aunt paty and Blanca from fresno have seen my snaps. The ones from pride and the ones from yesterday. I'm wearing a dress and yesterday I had my lips as red as fire.

Tomorrow Catherine'll pick me up. She'll come home in the early evening. She said I could wear the blue dress. Both my father and Luis have seen me in it. Miguel and my mother are the most supporting and knowing ones. Would they say something? Would my mother talk about me in the masculine? Would I dare to tell her my name?

It's hot in here. I did the exercise but could not finish. My tank was soaked and there were dark spots of sweat over my chest. It looks more prominent and noticeable. When I sent Catherine the picture, that was the word she replied.

I keep thinking about tomorrow. My father, who has seen me already won't be home by the time I leave. My mother will. I can mention to her the black bag of clothes that stays here in the back, as if there were any doubts that I want to get rid of those.

What if she asks me if I want clothes? What if she offers to go shopping with me? What if she proposes to change the way she refers to me? Why does it scare me? Why the hell do I want to post it, then?

Rene said it, like psychoanalysis, as you said, it's all about timing.

Is this the right time? Am I ready? Will I ever be?

I signed out of the profile and got into the old one. It's open right now, as if there were any possibility that I'm going to change tabs and post it right now.

Which one scares me the most? That there will be obnoxious comments making questions or jokes? Or that it will stay ignored and invisible?

In this profile, where I'm acquainted with strangers, I can see posts of familiar people. My mother just posted an oblivious game of nominating people to share stupid shit. She posted this picture about motherhood and pride. In the picture Miguel is in the middle, smiling. It's his birthday. Besides him there are my parents, and on the other side, are both Luis and me. I look at myself as if I were a stranger. I see it as if it were so old. Is it my hair or my complexion? Is my face broader and rounder?

Another post is a picture of an old cartoon. It expects the year 2017 and the things to come. Hey Arnold. I saw that show. I liked it. The post is from Moncayo's profile. I see the number of likes in it and get curious. I click there and another window opens with the list of names. The last one is Monica. She didn't even watch it. I know that, she used to tell me when we confided in each other. After seeing her I get irritated. I think about considering looking out for her and yet again I get caught in thinking about her.

There are new episodes of Steven Universe. I saw four when Catherine was doing something. The last one is about Pearl and the relationship with Greg, Steven's dad. She sings about how it's over and Rose chose him. "It's over, why can't I move one?"

Was that the reason I cried? No. I cried when Steven sings to the both of them.

I'm nervous about tomorrow. She'll come in the afternoon. Late in the day, between four and five. What will happen? What will people say? What will I do?

Am I anxious? Today's the last day of rest. Tomorrow I'll continue with the horse urine. Horse piss junkie. I chuckle every time I remember.

Are changes real? I'm not imagining them. I look different. Am I different?

Have I changed?

My mind suddenly went blank. From what thought did I try to escape?

Why do I always keep either hiding or running?

## 2016-07-22

I'm dressed again, the same blue dress, make up and hair. All done and worn. I'm again in my room with the closed door. Am I stuck again? Why don't I open the door? Luis has seen me this way, both in pictures and in person. It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Catherine yesterday said she would pick me up in half an hour. Her car is failing. Her dad would check it. That was a couple of minutes ago and she hasn't answered yet. I was supposed to post it. I thought about it. I want to. People seeing, knowing. This whole house knows and yet everything is the same. I am nervous about my clothes and face. I've been changing.

Have I changed enough?

It's been easier and easier telling people. The first time I lasted like two hours getting the courage and then I couldn't even say the word. Last time I told it like if I had just painted my hair.

Am I ready? Everything was about timing. Do I want my mother confronting me?

Would it be confrontation?

I haven't even reached half of the words for today. Why did I start just now? Because I'm nervous. About what? Going out of this room? Stop hiding here or everywhere?

I've checked the words countless times. Three, four drafts I've made and discarded. The last one I am comfortable with. I read it several times in bed, pronouncing every word under my breath as if I were whispering to the world.

I have the profile open here in the computer. Notifications keep appearing about stuff I don't care about. What people are interested in doing near me, or the likes and comments of the picture my mother posted about maternity, or a new post in the group of the faculty I no longer attend.

I stand up again and again and get close the door. Even though I preach to myself every day about pride and shame I hesitate before opening the door. What is it that I'm scared of? They already know, everybody here. Half of them have seen me. Is it showing myself? Then why do I want to?

I signed out from that profile from every device but here. Will I really post it? I changed tabs a while ago and saw the people online. Vanessa from highschool, my godparents the parents of Jessica, Medrano, classmates of both college and high school. People I don't care about knowing and people I don't really know.

Will my mother call me after seeing it? Will she comment in it and share it? Will she cry and show it to my dad?

She does know I'm trans right? She knows about the laser and endocrinologist and the hormones and the changes. Why is my heart running? Why does every part of me wants to run away?

"Yes, it's me. I am Sofia.

I am not Ivan, nor he. I am she, I'm trans.

I'm not saying it because I have or should to. I want to say it.

Honestly most of the times I've told I haven't liked it. Since not too long ago, I felt like in a confessionary sharing a shameful secret. Yeah, it was a secret, but it's not a sin to be confessed. It should neither be shameful. I'm tired of hiding it, hiding myself.

This is not my life, it's not who I am. I am not a man, nor am I Ivan.

It's not a lifestyle or a choice, or a sickness or a fetish. I'm not a gay man, nor a cross-dresser, nor a tranny. I'm not a cliche nor a joke. I don't wish to turn into gossip.
I'm just me, trying to live how I really feel, comfortable, without shame nor fear, authentic.

I can change how I dress and act and talk and look. There are ways to change even my body. There is no therapy or pill that can change who I really am, I can only hide it. For a long time, even without realizing it, I lived like that, hiding, first from myself and then from the world. I'm sick of feeling invisible.

This is my life, no one is going to live it for me and I should not live it for anyone. I'll dress and act and look how I want, how I please.

I am a transgender woman, yes, but I'm the same person I've always been. Just as I'm from Tijuana, and a psychologist, and I love old books and notebooks, and listen to sad music, and avoid cheese and prefer my coffee bitter... Being trans is just one of the many things that describe me, not something that defines me.

Just as I eventually will stop fully pretending to be Ivan, today I'll stop using this profile. I won't delete the account the same way I can not delete my past.

For whoever wants to support me, or be with me, or just stay in contact, or knowing what's new in my life, Sofia Fernandez will be my new profile. Any comment or question, you know who I am and where to find me.

If I know something it's that my life won't be easy. It will be a long and hard path. Nonetheless, it's unimaginable the relief I feel knowing that I won't have to take it by myself.

Even if just for today, thanks for reading me, for seeing me."

Catherine is not here yet. I've posted it. It's done. No more hesitation or doubt. I'm out, I'm visible.

I am going to open the door.


## 2016-07-23

I did publish it. I left home and got into Catherine's car. I showed her the picture of the notification about the post I was tagged in from Ivan. The notifications started appearing. Even though I had signed out of Ivan's profile, the little boxes kept telling me people commented on a post I was tagged in, and others about the friend requests. I turned off the notifications, of both Facebook and the e-mail.

I kept my head occupied with my date. We ate in Giuseppi's. We ordered a pizza and a salad. I thought I heard one of the girls from the next table say something about my hair as we passed and took our seats. The waiters welcomed us and asked us if we were ready.

Both Miguel and Luis saw me leaving. I didn't wore the black sweater.

After dinner, we walked and took pictures. We played pokemon and had fun. I love her, I really do. I see her face and I want to get close and hug her and kiss her in those full lips. I don't care about anyone's reaction when I'm with her. I feel happy.

I caught glimpses of the notifications. I had 62 friends requests. More than a hundred likes. I was scared it would go unnoticed. I kept it unseen until this morning.

I didn't cry when I read the comments. I didn't know how I would feel. What was I expecting? I read them and see them, and look through the faces and their words, and I felt, warm. It was nice.

There was something, though.

Catherine told me that my hesitation could be about who would not be there. I replied that I wasn't worried about that. The people close to me already knew. There was no one I could think of that I'd miss from there.

Today I realized I was wrong. I saw the faces and accepted the requests and I thought about Valeria, she was there. Omar Moncayo and Rafa, too, they would send me the requests later. Just one person was left from the last picture I saw.

She doesn't have me on Facebook. I deleted her. There is no way she can see it. Do I want her, too?

I wrote a message for her. I made the text I could send her, apologizing, telling her about her mementos.

There is no way I can send it to her. She has not signed in whatsapp in more than a week. I don't have her in any of the two Facebook profiles. Do I want her to read the message? I wrote it and read it and I think is pathetic. What difference is it in there from the other cringing messages I would send her years before?

I made a mistake, maybe. I regret the way I treated her, sure, and what happened. But there is no way a simple message can fix anything.

"A couple of weeks ago I saw you and your boyfriend. I had this ill felling as if I should avoid talking to you or letting you see me, shame of being seen by you or him in a dress. Then I thought that maybe you have seen me before without my noticing. Lots of times I was nervous to think you had to give explanations about me or answering uncomfortable questions. Others I thought probably months passed without you hearing or remembering my name.

I was the one who looked out for you after the weeks and months of silence but it was I, too, who deleted you from Facebook. It wasn't because of hate or resentment. It wasn't so you could not know about me, it was so I could not know about you. With time I would think of you and look for you, I saw your life and it hurt knowing about you.

Some days ago I finally cleaned the box of memories about you. It was something I avoided for a long time. I didn't want to read your notes and letters or see your gifts and mementos. I couldn't deal with the emotions and memories.

It hurt reading about what you felt about me and your promises and cares and then think about what happened.

'She left, she was the only one who left', I would think a thousand times after you told me in October you could not be my friend.

In my anger I never thought about what I did to you. I didn't just leave you, I betrayed you. I showed you a mask and let you fall in love with it. I met you Ivan and tell you his story and secrets, you loved him and learned to need him and invite him to your world. You imagined a future with him. Even if with time you stopped loving him, he once was your best friend. And I took him from you. I took him from your hands and told you he didn't exist.

Why would you want to be my friend? How could I pretend to ask you to stay and see him change and disappearing?

Maybe you needed him or missed him the way I missed and needed you as my best friend. Maybe you found other friends who took his place, I don't know.

I know we don't have any relationship anymore. In a way we were once best friends, but in other we're nothing more than two strangers. A lot of times I thought about sending you the friend request from my new profile as with all the people who knew about me. I never could convince me that it was a good idea. I understand if you want to keep not knowing anything about me. I hope it's not too late, if you already got over or left it all behind, to say it to you:

I'm really sorry. I'm sorry if I hurt you in any way. It was never my intention to betray you or play with you. I regret that you got caught in the middle of everything that happened to me.

PS I have your hairpins and the stamp and box with your name. They're not mine and never were meant for me to have them. I feel wrong keeping them and thought you might want them back.

## 2016-07-24

I did not sent the letter to Monica. In hindsight I am thankful I took that choice. It was the right one. It was another ill-attempt to ease my own conscience attributing all blame to myself and exonerating her from every sin in a begging attempt to not being rejected. It was pathetic.

I took the less obvious choice, no explanations, no apologies. It might look hypocritical, but I don't really regret it. I sent her the friend request and went to sleep. Lot of things happened today, and even yesterday I did more than just that.

I updated my profile picture and cover photo. The former one was the first picture I took from my date with Catherine, looking downsides to my phone in a serious and doubtful expression. "Have I done the right thing?" The latter, on the other hand was a game of shadows. Long legs and dark bodies, two hands in the middle grasping each other. Companionship and love. "By your side the world seems so small and I lose all fear. With you, I feel invincible".

I went to sleep. No, I went to bed.

I don't know how many hours I did rest. Again the thoughts and ideas about a conference got rushed into my mind, as if the possibility of me doing something like that was nearing.

The alarm clock woke up at 5. I killed it before the echo and waited 20 minutes 'till the next one. There was a fainter, younger and weaker one. Like a chorus far far away. I went to shower and get ready. I did not need to shave. The machine, two touches next to my chin were enough. I put my bra after the shower. It's the first time I don't hide it. I wore make up, too, but just a touch, a barely noticeable veil that could hide any trace left of masculinity.

We accompanied Miguel to leave him in the convention center. This time the whole family went. Until now I saw it as the two women going with the three men that went yesterday. Is that really how I see it? Am I closer to my mother, now?

She came down the stairs as I was finishing myself. "are you ready?" she asked casually, without intent nor care. I think I heard her use the feminine form. I could be mistaken. It doesn't matter, though. I felt nothing, no strangeness or cringing or shame, only acceptance.

The border patrol looked at the visas. I put them out of their sleeves so I know the order they were set in. My father's, my mother's, mine and then my siblings'. He looked at the first one saying it's name out loud at the same time his eyes looked for my father. He said the second's name and his eyes went straight to my mother's. When he got to my card, he said in a different inflection. It wasn't of certainty, it was of doubt. He skipped my face and looked at Luis besides me, and then Miguel. I raised my hand and admitted my former name. He looked at me and said nothing. He kept going.

We ate breakfast at Denny's. After then my father took us to the beach. I walked through the rocks crossing the sand into the ocean. I felt the sound of its waves splashing and covering me. I looked at the whiteness of its spume and wanted to get lost in it. I could had kept going, hopping rock to rock until the very end, every slippery step a test of endurance. What would happen when I finally got to the edge? Would it be time to come back or would a final step into the ocean be the perfect ending?

Are these hints of sparks of a suicidal kindle?

No, I know better than that.

More than a hundred people accepted me and looked for me and added me. Words like strong and brave and courageous and admirable. They mean nothing. It's being intelligent all over again. Sometimes I keep feeling like the dumbest imbecile in the whole world. An incompetent fool in charge of a whole universe. I'm weak and cowardly and scared and potentially hated.

Nobody hates me, even though I want more names to add on the list to bury the one, no one seems to dare speak up. Why am I liked?

What do they see that I can't?

I could just ask Monica if she had accepted the request.

I liked a picture of Omar and she was one of the three people who liked the 10 minutes old post. She liked another one.

Should I cancel the request? Or should it die of age in her screen like a white flag rotting over islands of corpses.



## 2016-07-25

Why can't I last more than a fucking week without crying?

The request stayed unanswered and I felt in limbo. Sometimes the falling is way worse than the actual impact. I read the drafted message countless times yesterday an in the morning. It was sent and seen by noon. Just sending it was a relief, the message was delivered, it was her choice to either read it or not. My job was done.

In it I deleted most of the pathetic shit I regretted. I left just enough to feel apologetic and sincere. It was. I wasn't faking, it wasn't an attempt to reconciliation. I looked for her forgiveness. I guess I will never have it.

I feel this whole range of emotions just now.

She did answer. Is the impact really less painful to the time I fell? It's bee hit by hit. I had problems with guilt. I know I wasn't a monster. Why do I fee... No, I don't feel like one. I won't let her do this to me again. I apologized, she didn't.

I feel this urge to keep crying, to scream to a pillow. This past months it was the feeling of rejection but now it's because I deserved it? What is it that I do? What was my so big mistake?

I would prefer greatly that it was because of me.

"do you still doubt that you hurt me?"

Was it the time she returned from France? The request of my book back. Does it even matter?

She was no blameless victim, either. I can twist the story and play the martyr. That's what I've done my whole life. At least now I can leave it like this. Embrace the guilt for a while. If she can't or won't, I can forgive myself.

Should I throw back blame? Should I say something? Anything? Is staying quiet not the same thing Ivan did with her?

No, it truly doesn't matter. It won't change a thing. Her mind about my blame won't change. I'll forget her, eventually, maybe?

Her hate...

"I'm perfectly, I just don't want you looking for me anymore. Honestly, it's not your change, is that independently of whatever you are, it doesn't change the fact that you behaved like an asshole with me."

It was a swift and straight stab. The blade felt cold and it slide like into butter. A quick and firmly shock of pain titillating across my whole body. It's not because it's true, it's not because it came from her, it's because what my guilt had always said. It's the echo of the sadistic voice that keeps me from sleeping.

I hope, with time, I can remember this and see it in a different light.

Even thought the whole conversation was said as if I were two different people, I'm not. Ivan's mistakes and rights were mine. I wasn't another person, I was a younger and naiver one. I've grown, I've changed, and I'll continue to do so. I was right, I can't do anything to change what happened. I took responsability and apologized. I'll give her her things back, inside the box I'll give her the half keychain with her name in it and the date.

It contradicts herself, when she both says I took her best friend mercilessly from her, and yet says it wasn't about the change but how I behaved?

It's her problem. I know what I did and what I feel guilty about.

It's done. It's done.

No, the relationship is done, although it had ended for years. The friendship is done, although it ended for months. There is nothing left but memories, those nobody will take from me, not even her. But why do they hurt me so much?

I feel the fresh tears rolling and falling on my neck. Will there be wet spots in my tank? Will they leave a mark on my skin like the acid they feel like?

Can I ask my brother and mother to delete her? Why?

I won't look for her anymore, like she wants. I don't want to, either. Why does it hurt? Why did her words were like a twist to the hitting dagger?

"Ok", I ended the conversation. Everything was said. She insulted me. She said what she had to say and I delivered my message. This is closure... Another one. The definitive one.

Can I ask her to take her phantom back? Can I let her know about it?

Can it be killed?

## 2016-07-26

It was a hard night indeed. I wrote the words after Monica's messages. "You were like an asshole to me".

I cried like I hadn't cried in a lot, even for now that I'm under the hormone regimen. I talked with Catherine even though I didn't really want to. I felt like thrash. Guilty as fuck. It hurt that I had lost my best friend because of something I didn't choose nor control, it seemed unfair. And it hit me, a different outcome. It wasn't, honestly, my change, it was my behaviour, my actions... It was indeed, my fault. I lost her.

I was enraged, but was it with myself or her? Her first messages had this hostile subtext, like a tasteless and odorless poison very well hidden. It was distant and cold, like a therapist trying to uncover the truth with loaded questions.

"Do you still doubt that you hurt me?"

After I answered them defensively and truthfully I asked her, a counter-attack, "Is that all you're going to say?". She hid her dagger and gave me a well meaning and sugary speech about how she wishes me the best and not any evil, it's good I live now like I want to, I got what I want, and I don't have to hide anymore.

I could spend hours trying to analyze her messages, follow the traces of her hits looking for her wounded scars. But what's the point, really? I did took screenshots of the messages, but by now they're deleted, just as the conversation.

I made the mistake of continuing. Talking a little about me, a little about my feelings and guilt. It took her out of her preparedness. Her poison was uncovered. Her hits were dirty, until she finally told the truth.

"I'm perfectly, I just don't want you to look for me anymore" That hurt almost as much as her insult. Was she defending herself against the accusation of intolerance? "It's not about your change, I don't care what (what, not who, what) you are, you behave like an asshole to me".

It doesn't fit. In her arranged speech she prefaced the reason about not being my friend utilizing my own apology: "like you said, you took my best friend mercilessly from me, I can't be your friend." So I both took Ivan from her, as changing, and, at the same time, whomever I was behaved like an asshole.

My actions, whatever they were, are worse than her previous ex, whom she's utilizing as a courier of her things. He "cheated" on her. They were in a 'relationship' and he was seeing another girl. They're still friends. I was an asshole. Ok.

Am I rationalizing, now? Excusing myself because of the guilt?

I cried almost the whole time from finishing the words until falling asleep. I didn't just delete the conversation and canceled the request. I blocked her from Facebook, I deleted her contact from my phone.

I woke up by the early six and took pills for my headache. I grabbed her pictures and notes, my zippo and a white plate. I sat outside and burned the stuff. First it was the cardboard bookmark with song lyrics and a message. It curled and grayed like an aging head of an old man. Then it were some pictures, the one from the ride in Universal Studios. The one were we played in a garden fence in high school. The little yellow bird from Snoopy that she made me. The little notes. Everything burned and turn to ashes.

Does it still count if I have it on video?

I've seen it a couple of times, the faces disintegrating, the words "always yours" "I love you" "always your little bird" fading away and turning into dust.

I sent a message to Valeria asking her if she knew something about me. She did see the profile a couple days before, thought it was a cousin that look incredibly like me, she even showed it to Omar.

That's what she say, at least. Who knows.

Does it matter? How many people had seen the profile and thought similarly? People on the street would see me like that and think I look amazingly like Ivan? Does that mean they see a woman? Should I be proud?

Then not coming out would be staying hidden. People would never find me and relate to me. Not unless they clicked and got in.

I thought about asking her about Monica. I decided not to. I should delete her from everything in my life.

Tomorrow I must not forget the box.

"You throw away the stuff

We both were assholes

I apologized -Sofia"




## 2016-07-27

Almost forgot to write today's words. I was already lying in bed and put my pillow over my eyes. I'm tired.

I went to the beach. I put the alarm clock to wake me up near 10. Yesterday night I spent it chatting with Valeria. I asked her if she had known something about me before I came out. She had seen the profile, but thought it was a cousin of mine. After those kinds of questions and stories, I told her parts of mine. I explained the hormones and its uses and then my sexual orientation. It was nice, talking with someone different, having a new perspective of things. It's freeing this new feeling of liberty and openness.

I played with Luis a little in the wii just moments ago.

He just entered the room trying to tell me a new gossip. He opened the door and exclaimed "Ivan... I mean Sofia, sorry, it slipped... today my mother dropped two dishes of the green ones"

I heard it. I had finished showering and was getting ready to leave for therapy. I put my shorts and a blouse with the long tail. The white bra underneath it. I look feminine enough.

Catherine sent me a message that she would accompany her mother to some places. 20 minutes before I had to leave, she sent me another one that she was near bissu. I could pick her up and she would come with me to therapy. I did. I left and picked her up. Did her mom see me? Did I look feminine? Like a girl?

We walked to Rene's and stop in an Oxxo in the way.

"Sometimes I feel like the other one"... I asked her to never say that. She's not the other one and she wasn't. As Ivan I knew myself with her. We went to the hotel days after I broke up with Monica, yeah, but we didn't go with the intention of doing nothing sexual. We were going just to exchange clothes, try it out, experiment a little.

I try remembering, not months ago, years. The first times I broke up with Monica it was so hard for the days to pass without talking. It was months before the last message. Another couple of days just passed.

In session I talked about Monica and my public announcement. I asked my mother for change, to break me a bill of 500. She saw me with the clothes and make up. She said nothing about it, but as I left, she made no mention of son or Ivan.

With Rene I thought of the possibility that my own transformation is a trigger to Monica's own sexuality issues. Maybe she likes me, she's attracted to me as a girl, too. That would be terrifying and confusing. She wanted to try it, and when she did, she wanted to do it again. Later when I asked her she said no. But the times of silence were because of me. In October it was because it was weird that I referred to myself as a woman. I asked her to respect me, to not tell me I looked like a freak. Maybe she was just trying to convince herself I looked bad.

In Spain she asked me to not send pictures.

It sounded very defensive her statement that it was not because of my change, it was because I behaved like an asshole. As if it were a reason to not like me.

It's not my problem. It doesn't change shit.

I won't benefit from her friendship. It's better to just let her go.

We walked back to the car and Catherine told me she thought about it, too, but decided to say nothing. We drove and met with the gang in the park near the beach. Paola just said hi and then left. She had her first patient. Chevo left, too, to pick his car.

We chatted and talked, both in the pizzeria and the beach. We bought chips and water and then a clamato with beer. The guy in there asked us for our ids. He grabbed mine and even covered my name with his finger. He saw the picture and return it. He barely glanced at it. I was relieved. Everyone talked about their parents and even I shared.

I don't have problems with them. They're accepting and trusting. My father didn't rush me to get a job, my mother does not make an issue about my leavings.

I am fortunate.

Luis told me it's possible that my grandma might come friday. Will she say something? Will I talk with her?

Will she call me Sofia? This Saturday my mom will go with my godmother to the vineyard. Will I dare to ask her what she said? Why would I want to know?

## 2016-07-28

I should start the words now. I don't know what to talk about. My grandmother came from Mexicali. My parents left to pick her up from the bus station. I was playing Mario Kart with Luis. I was in the bathroom, drowning in sweat, when they return. For a moment I didn't know what to expect. They asked for me but said Ivan. I came down and she hugged and kissed me. She told me my aunt sent me a hug, too. Was it because of my post? They have not forgotten.

I don't have to hide it. I can just live it. They'll follow my lead.

Luis today started saying it more and more, even to my mother. I just needed to start referring myself as I want. Will I dare to do it in front everybody?

My face is changed. It's smoother and softer. My beard is almost unnoticeable.

Yesterday Paola reminded us of going out Saturday night. I was a little excited. It would not be like the last time when it turned sour after Catherine's ill-feeling and Anahi's lack of taste of beer.

This time it's supposed to be all of us. The seven. When I asked Catherine about the clothes I could wear, she asked and then continued saying she doubted she would go. She doesn't have much money and neither much will. I felt disappointed. I did, I wanted to.

After talking I was convinced it was going to end up awkwardly awful, too. Anahi didn't know that there was going to be all of us. She would be separated and down. She would stay with me and Catherine feel estranged.

If she didn't go, there was no point in me going alone.

When I hear my name, Catherine is the only that I truly believe.

I asked Miguel for the game of Pokemon and to borrow his game boy sp. They're ready, next time that I see Catherine, I can give it to her. We can both start the game at the same time. The first generation of pokemon. Almost 20 years ago. I remember being in the church lectures and staying with Edgar and Jessica, seeing him play, talk about it.

Today both of them added me on Facebook.

Jessica posted the picture of her take of protest. She's officially a nutriologist. I liked her picture. Was it with that intention? No, it took me by surprise. Moments after that I received her notification. I accepted without delay. I received then an explanation, a message. She accepts me and wishes me the best. Hopefully accepting myself (feminine) will let me blossom to my full potential... or something like that.

Even though she has known me almost all of our life, she realized you always learn something new from your friends.

That's true. She was my best friend, for years, for a lot longer than Monica. Jessica left, too. No, she didn't leave. We both drifted apart, our families did. We shared our childhood. We played games in both our houses. We played videogames and watched television and went to theme parks and even shared beds. We playfully called each other siblings. It was really nice and I had forgotten about it. No, I did remember, just, didn't have it present.

I was so busy thinking in the 5? 6 years? that I shared with Monica, that I forgot about the decade that I shared with her. She was, in a way, my first kiss. She wasn't a romantic love, but a fraternal one. A puerile and innocent one. We held hands sometimes, we saw each other cry. She saw me lots of times more than I did her. We met in preschool and shared the 6 years of elementary. We were in the same jr high the first year, and the same class the rest. We graduated and went to the same high school and were just friends, acquaintances. After her I met Monica. Did they ever meet?

Yes. Once.

Just like Catherine and Monica did.

Catherine and Jessica were in the same class the first year of high school. They were not friends, just acquaintances. Like we the two years before.

I talked with Diana. Would I dare talk to her again? Try to reach out, ask how her life is, remembering like I'm doing right now.

In high school I felt isolated. I took myself out of every social circle I ever pertained.

I only needed Monica, I was convinced. Now she's really gone, I should let myself open up. Reach out to those people who were close.

Maybe tomorrow, maybe next week.

Perhaps.

## 2016-07-29

I was in bed chatting with Catherine. We talked about tomorrow, were we going to go sell, would we go in the evening? Should we take a uber or should I ask my dad for a ride? Luis got in the room and sat in my chair, the conversation was showing in the monitor. Somehow the conversation turned into a different path.

"Luis calls you Sofia"

Seconds later, Luis said: "I try, to, sometimes I get confused".

What?

I saw him sitting in the chair turning one side to the other. Everything came together. Sofia, Dofia. He sees me. He comes and goes with the masculine and feminine.

It gets awkward and uncomfortable sometimes. What would my parents say? Why would they say something? Everybody knows.

My grandmother came yesterday after everyone was in their room. She hugged me while I was in bed. She kissed my cheek and assured me that nothing would change between us. She would always love me and adore me, and I would always be her little one. She hugged me again and finished saying that Edgar, as well, asked her to hug me in his part.

Everyone is accepting and loving. Today my cousin Charly added me and sent me a text message saying he would support me.

I can't help but feel surprised. Everybody was supposed to be prejudiced and irrational? Where are all those people who comment hateful stuff on the internet? Where are the people that would mock me or push me away?

I know they are somewhere. Medrano, Alan, they were some of my closest friends. Other people from highschool and jr high. People from the family. More distant ones, sure. I don't miss them.

Tomorrow I'll wear a dress and ask my dad to drive me. What if he says something? What could he say?

I did not start the conversation with Jessica. Tomorrow my Mom will go with her mother. I told my mom I would go and sell the clothes I took out of my closet. I made no mention about my abhorrence to them or my wish to refill it.

She might intuit it, but I have to say it. No, I want to say it. Not this weekend. Tomorrow I'll go sell with my girlfriend.

I'll go make her company. When she told me the things I should take I felt anxious. I felt useless and incompetent. I could not stand beside her and sell stuff, I could not attend people coming and asking questions. I wished not to go. I could just go and put the bag in the donation box outside the neighborhood.

She told me to go. She could sell them and I would just make her company. I was relieved but at the same time, uneasy.

It's fine. I can let her have all of the gains.

It's hot. The summer has come with its full blaze. The fan is turning spitting its air to the room, but it's not enough. I showered already and dressed in loose shorts and a thin tank. My body is changing and it looks weird now in this attire. My breasts are small but noticeable. My nipples are pointy and extremely sensitive.

Tomorrow I'll wear shorts and a blouse to the swap meet. I'll return and shower and get ready. I thought about wearing the gray dress. I told Catherine matter-of-factly I would not wear the blue one. "I'm going to wear the sleeve-less gray one, the first one you gave to me. I've worn the blue a lot" She told me it was fina, I had a point.

Later I mentioned I planned on putting on the red tights. "Yes?", she asked. I tried to sound sure and convinced and confirmed myself.

I failed in my bluff and later confessed my worry: "you think I'll look bad, right?" She has a point, she doesn't like them. She prefers the other dress. The gray one is really short and the colored tights are noticeable. What if I look bad or grab too much attention to myself?

She said that no, she had not thought that.

I saw a picture of three years ago when we were in the Finances building, at the top floor, sitting. I had my hair longish for a man but comparably way shorter than now. I had a black scarce beard and mustache that framed the white-teethed smiled I showed the camera. I was broad but not fat nor big. I looked strong. There was some melancholy hidden in my small eyes. She was sitting besides me, smiling. Her eyes framed in black and her closed smile glowing.

That was the day Chevo and Jessica met us there and we changed shoes.

It was when she liked Ivan. She liked him like that. I looked good.

"We made a cute straight couple, just as we make a cute lesbian one now"

## 2016-07-30

I was with Catherine, sitting in the stand she put herself in front of the house that lends her the space. The clothes were lying on the floor over two sheets extended. There were some coats and dresses hung. Besides most of the clothes were the masculine clothes I took. Besides them a filled suitcase with the cheapest of all.

I took the game boys so we could play in the dead time. We chatted, too. Some people approached us and called us girls. A couple of times I took both of our phones and walked around the block to incubate my pokemon Go eggs and see if I could find a new one. I gave three rounds. The first one was the shortest, just uphill and return from where I had parked in the first place, before I moved the car near Catherine's. The second one was the longest, I went to the other side and looked at the other stands and what they offered. A couple of people maintained their eyes on me, as if there was something weird. I kept walking, as if I had not noticed as if I did not care.

I returned a couple minutes later when the stench of the food and cheap stuff was too much to bear and the halls seemed to become narrower.

The last one was similar to the first but to the second block. There were some dogs so I changed streets. I had Catherine's iphone in my shorts back pocket. Mine I grabbed firmly in the palm of my hand. I noticed the two kids hanging by their fence before they saw me. The street was empty so their first call as "sir", hurt me. I kept walking as if I had not hear or didn't identified to the call. I don't know if it was the same one or the other one that tried again: "Girl"... I was a couple of steps ahead of them so I turn my head and faced them. I smiled subtly ceding them my attention. I can't remember which one was first. One asked me to approach them, and the other just said "Would you give me a kiss?". I smiled openly but shaked my head. I kept on walking. The one who asked me to approach them seemed mad, a little disappointed, perhaps? What was his intention, maybe he wanted to see me closer, maybe he wanted to tell me straight to my face. Would he nicer had I agreed?

"With that face you look like a man!"

I was perplexed. I kept walking. So, I had a manly face. Was it the smile? Was it the lack of make up? He talked about my face. Maybe they saw my breasts or smooth legs.

He said I looked like a man. As if I were not. I am not. So was he validating in his obnoxious and bratty way?

I was doubtful after that.

We left a couple of minutes shy of noon. We stopped in a Chinese restaurant and order a lunch for the two of us. Nobody turned at us and nobody made any faces. The waitress welcomed us without any mention of gender. The only thing was the face of the bill going straight at me. Was it a sign? Was it just the insecurity awaken because of the two brats?

Some minutes ago, my grandmother's shadow tapped my shoulder from the door. I turned as she approached closer, with the intention of saying something. Was it going to be like when I arrived and she talked with me some minutes about the food she prepared and the chores she did and the spiders she found. "Luis came to me yesterday with his phone and told me 'look, nana, what Sofia posted about me'. She said the name and it felt weird but not in a bad way. Like a scurry tingling crawling in my veins all the way from my fingers to my heart.

It wasn't. This time was more direct. She came as close as she could and asked me straight to my face. "Sofi? Do I call you Sofi, my love?...
 I was dumbfound. I smiled automatically. It was an autonomous response to an unregistered stimulus. She said it again, and this time it made perfect sense and I was able to answer mutedly. I nodded with the most shy eyes I've ever showed. She confirmed it as she hugged and kiss my cheek. It's going to be hard to get use to, but I'll be Sofi, her love.

And I thought I smiled like an idiot when the gas dispatcher called me "miss" twice as I left, even after hearing my voice.

I should be getting ready to this night out.

## 2016-07-31

I left the room just like that other time. Miguel and Luis were downstairs like the last one. I hid my legs behind the kitchen counter, although my torso and face were completely visible. I opened my red lips and asked him if we were going to pick up my mom. He replied with the question of what time I had accorded of meeting my friends.

Miguel was going to stay. Luis stood up and I saw his intention of going with us. I felt relief. I wanted to hug him and thank him. Were we going to pick my mom before? Would she see me?

My father said no more words to me in all the trip until we got there. He told me to take care. I thanked him and got off. I sat in front of the fountain, waiting for the rest. There was a girl with earphones and net tights. I glanced a couple of times at her. Was she alone like me? How wasn't she bothered?

Catherine and Anahi came together. They were the first to arrive. We sat where I was for a couple of minutes. They talked about pokemon and I felt as lonely as before. I was a little hurt by my father's avoiding eyes and his scalding silence.

We went ahead to El Tigre and sat in the table next to the entrance. We were going to order when Paola S arrived. A couple of minutes later, Paola A got to us.

It was a fun night, we talked and laughed. I felt comfortable in my clothes, in my skin. In every bar we were asked for our ids and yet nobody made even a face with mine. They kept gendering me correctly. I used the ladies' bathroom in the last bar where we smoked hookah. Paola told us about her break up. Anahi was the first one to leave. The rest of us left at the same time.

The first bar was El Tigre, we drank a liter each. I finished Anahi's. From there we went to Zenzontle. We drank pulque and Paolas, beer. I tried some of the nachos. I bared the cheese. We accompanied Anahi to the crossing strip and then returned to the hookah bar.

We took our respective ubers. Everybody was awake her, it was early still. Luis was with me in my room. It was weird the sensation of taking my clothes. A week ago I would do it without a second thought. Now, he said something about my breasts how he saw me flat when I left but there he thought how good for me and that the hormones were doing its thing. "Of course I don't mean anything, you are my sister"

Today we were in my bed when they returned from the park. First was Luis with me and then my mother came an lied between us. We talked about our phones and pokemon and stuff in general. I could notice in the earrings she had in her hands and the couple of tries of sending Luis away that she wanted to tell me something. Finally, after my grandma called her a couple of times, she showed me the earrings. "They are hand-crafter of a white and red stone, do you like them?" She handed them to me and I looked at them. I smiled shyly. "For whom?" "Well, for you?" I felt uncomfortable and vulnerable, I shake my head without erasing the smile. I handed them back without any malice. She laughed. "They're long? How do you like them?" I started my answer when she completed them herself: "You don't have earholes!" She laughed out loud and said she could do them herself. She asked my grandmother. "For whom?" "For Sofia".

They sat at the table and even though I am not really hungry, I sat and ate with them. I asked my mother about Norma. She started saying how Jessica (I wrote an M... as if I were going to write another name) was thinking about getting breast implants.

Then continued about me. Hormones, maybe she could take the same and get some growth.

"she's been trying to change the way she addresses me. She wakes in the morning and says to herself that's going to be the day she calls me Sofia. Ivan comes out instead. I don't blame her. I don't even blame my dad for answering her when they were at the beach and she asked him for him to say that I would always be Ivan to him.

I get it.

"I see her and I see Ivan, wearing Ivan clothes, It's been so many years and it's hard." That's the reason she asked me about shoes and clothes later that day.

She was upset that I had not told her about posting it. It was impulsive after long moments of hard consideration. I did what I had to do.

Norma read it a couple of times. She was perplexed, she did not what to say. Would she call, send a message? Would she comment there or add me?

My uncles contacted my mom this last week to show her their support. My grandma told my mom, and made her cry, her eyes got misty as she recalled it, how that same day of the post, both of my uncles and Fernando, their friend, reunited by the pool to drink, tall, and even cry?

My future, my life, how I've been living. All of our lives, my whole family, how would my dad take it?

How could I bare living like these all those years.

My godmother asked the same question, how could I excel at so many things and be a perfect student and feel as lonely as ever, with these emotions for so many years?

And I thought for a long time I had no reason to cry.

How do things change.

## 2016-08-01

Today came upon me as a heavy rock pushing me towards bed.

I postponed the alarm clock several times until time itself moved me and screamed directly in my ear. Catherine woke up in the breaking dawn to get ready for her first day in this semester of adult school. I kept wrestling with the dreariness of a new day.

Yesterday I showered shortly after Catherine's last message. I shaved for today's session. I exited my room and my grandma offered to make me breakfast. I accepted. Is this a better mood after her support and love? Is it guilt of the baseless resentment I had towards her?
After eating I showered and got ready. I tied and upped my hair in a modest bun behind my head. I wore man's jeans and a t-shirt with nothing underneath. I like the feeling of incongruence between my little more delicate body and this boxy clothes of the past.

I looked at my thighs squeezing themselves into the skinny legs of the pants. The cotton fabric embracing them. The shy curves that barely show halfway between my knees and my waist. My nipples are more sensitive than ever. The touch of the skin of my arm is enough to make me flinch.

My mother sent me to buy her some pastry and a bag of ice. I stopped in the oxxo but they ran out of bags. I returned home. I could bring the bag after coming from the laser session. This is the last paid one. Five sessions since April. Did the first session was before I started hormones? The technician welcomed me and confirmed it was the last one. She asked me if I had worn any kind of cream. Neither she nor the other had ever asked me that before. Did my skin look different? Maybe it's smoother and clearer. I can see my own face when I gaze into my reflection.

It was both less and more painful. There are lots of zones where there are not any single trace of hair. The cheeks and neck were just uncomfortable. As she went closer to the chin the pain started to increase. The last half of the upper lip had me in tears. The glasses were different. A piece of tissue under two lenses in the shape of half grapes. I missed the older googles. I imagined I was underwater, holding my breath and drowned of any sound of the world.

5 minutes. I lasted more going there than I did inside. I returned home with the bag of ice I bought in the gas station. I told a little about my session to my grandma. Does it hurt? Yeah, it does.

I thought about the comment my mother did. My godmother told her to ask me where do I go. Jessica has gone to a place for her mustache, but it has not worked. When I started to type the thought, the first letter it appeared was an M.

My grandmother seemed excited and smiled as if this were some big breakthrough. I mean, yeah, I guess it is. It was so 4 months ago when I started. Last year I dreaded shaving in the morning and having to worry about the shadow that would show in the evening. It was like a mark that would signal my fake status.

Now I take it for granted. I've been gendered female in shorts and t-shirt. I've been gendered female without any make up. Did I even shave before going to the swap meet?

I saw the last episode of the series Preacher. And the new episode of Mr Robot. It was hard to concentrate. When Catherine returned from her day in class she showed me her progress in Pokemon Go. I felt uneasy. What was it? I felt trapped. I went out, I showered and changed and got out. It's not like I'm always here. Two nights ago I was outside in a dress, shoulders bare and lips as red as my tights. I posted the video and pictures and my mother and family and even Maru liked them. I can show myself to the world. Why am I not ecstatic?

My mother made a comment today that between women there is no fight or something like that. Luis referred to me as her a couple of times.

Everybody said Ivan, though. I can't blame them. I guess I even blamed myself, dressing in this androgynous clothes and continuing in this faÃ§ade.

I can meet Catherine after her class and go shopping, I can ask my mother about going and looking for clothes.

Why would she not come with me? Would she be hurt that I'd prefer going with Catherine than her? She bought me earrings and I denied them.

Would I be comfortable? Why not?

## 2016-08-02

It's come again. I feel it right here over me, a dull and gray cloud dropping dry droplets of smoke.

Even finding the words is tiring. Are this just effects of the medication? Lack of them?

I am sad, I am tired. I feel like crying and lying in bed.

The whole day I've been hearing him, son, and Ivan. Even when my grandma came and acknowledge it she repeated it twice to my like making an emphasis to their mistakes. Luis corrects himself. It's not the mistake, I've always understood it's going to be something hard. It just hurts.

Tomorrow I have therapy again. I'll see him again and I can talk about this, about what has happened. The coming and words of my grandma. The talk with my mother about the weekend, the lying in my bed and the earrings, the going out to drinks and showing the id, my asking my dad for a ride and facing his silence.

My uncles gathered and talked about my loss. Ivan's departure. For a lot I used to wonder what would it be knowing how would people react after my dead. Isn't this what I wanted?

People keep adding me on the new Facebook. Every new request is a new name to the list of people who feels fine with my existence, everyone who has forgiven me for killing him.

I feel the pressure of their misnaming. It's because the clothes I wear, the way I speak. She say it herself: she saw me as Ivan for years and she sees me as him and wearing his clothes.

I don't dare to come and ask her or even telling my intentions of changing the way I look.

I never, ever, asked them the change the way the refer to me. Is that why I am crying? Because it was their own initiative and apparently it's not enough?

Will I leave Rene? Will I stop going to therapy? Should I talk to him about it? I should mention it.

I haven't reached the half and I'm tired. I haven't done the exercise for weeks and I feel exhausted. I want to leave the house but I don't have patients nor a job. i haven't updated the resume nor send it to anyone in months. I haven't started with the powerpoint presentations about the supposed course I could give.

I just lie in bed to dream or escape.

I want time to go faster. I want the changes to be more obvious. I want to no longer see him in the mirror. I want them to stop recognizing him in my eyes.

Today's tuesday. It's hard for me even realizing what day of the week it is. It seems like everyone I know has found a job and continued their life. To them, I changed sex. I found myself and started living happily and truthfully and authentic. At least that's what they said.

What would be worse? Their words being empty vessels of air or me being an impostor? I'm not happy, I;m not honest and I'm not authentic. I'm a melancholic, piece of shit.

I'm too hard on myself. What is it that I can't forgive me for?

Zayra had a point. I was a kid and I did the best I could do. I'm a grown person now. I'm doing the best I can.

The call me brave for what I dare to do. For telling them. Almost everyone who heard me made me think I was making a huge mistake. Were they right?

Would I be crying here right now if they weren't? Rene's been telling me for months to wait until I am ready. Ready to go out, ready to start hormones, ready to tell my parents or my brothers or anyone.

But I never was ready. I was scared shitless the first time I was in the car changing my clothes and even more the first time I felt a pair of eyes setting its gaze upon me. I could not make the phone call to set the appointment. I had to call the next day, and even then, although I never would admit it, I did use the three months of waiting as a time to make myself used to the idea.

Every time I've said it, it has been easier. But it has never been painless. The words cut me like razorblades as they pass through my throat and slice my mouth.

I stand there, with my mouth bleeding and my heart exposed, handed to them, and my eyes begging for mercy.

## 2016-08-03

"Sofi", my mom called me from outside my room, her voice coming from the kitchen. I went from my bed and faced her. She asked me to open her bottle of white wine. She drank half of a little glass and I three quarters of a small beer glass. My grandmother asked just two sips in a shot glass. She was the last one to finish it. I took the last gulp like I did them in Spain. I feel like when I was in there, except that I don't. I am trans, I am Sofia, a woman. I like who I am. I don't need to hide, anymore.

I'm a little tired and have a humming pain in the lower back.

I had my phone with me when I was sitting in the dinning table with the rest of my family, just talking about everything and anything. Cynthia was the one who published the post. It was publicity for the opening of a sexology master from the institute of sexology in Mexico. Could I apply there? How would I pay for it and maintain myself? Why do I keep thinking about failure, about the impossibility of overcoming the obstacles, not reaching the goal.

They are the same kind of thoughts I had before applying to the abroad program. I was never truly convinced I would go even until the day before actually leaving to the airport. Will this be like that? That was the hardest and painfuller and most beautiful and significant time of my life. I was born there. I let myself become. I was going to write it was the culmination of Ivan's life, but that's not true. It was the nexus between ours both.

I got into the page of the institute and read the convocatory of their short stories contest. It has to do with sexuality and its themes. I want to apply. Sure, they ask for an ID, but I cant tell them both my real and legal name. What could I write about? A trans girl like me? A lesbian couple meeting and falling in love? A young girl coming into her own sexuality?

A group of teenagers in a party, playing truth or dare, a bunch of short stories interconnecting themselves about the different matices of sexuality.

I have lots of ideas, would any of them be actually good? I have both time and ideas and intention. I should keep to it and actually try.

I woke up and ate breakfast and showered and left for therapy. My mother gave me the money without asking. I shaved even though it was hard on my skin and the black dots were as aggressive and visible as after the first session. I tried to tamed them with the make up. It was acceptable. My confidence was the most important factor.

I showed myself to them. I wore tapered jeans and a white tank top. The outline of the bra was almost screaming. My long red shirt was open and flowing besides the pair of small breasts. I walked towards Rene playing with my phone. I noticed no suspicious eyes, nothing. I walked just fine, by myself. Rene was alone when I got in. He received me and the session flowed smoothly. He made notice of the gift of my mother. The earrings were symbolic to my birth as a daughter. When a girl is born she receives earrings as gifts. The perforation of the earlobes is one of the earliest rituals. She gave them to me recognizing me as a woman, she handed them to me as a gesture of validation. She even forgot that I do not have the holes. She offered them to me and even invited my grandmother. A three generation feminine ritual of welcoming. And I denied it.

Exiting the parking lot the old man who received my ticket, gendered me as miss as he let me out. I bought the bag of ice that my mother asked me for and drove home.

When I put them in the fridge, my grandmother got closed and said to me secretly-like "your mother told me, open the door, 'Sofia arrived, she's knocking the door'". Just that was the theme with Rene. Her mention of it, the later one today, just bolded the idea I had.

It's my fault for dressing as a boy and wearing his clothes.

When my mom came down, she asked me directly: "When are we going to buy clothes?... Where are we going to buy them?"

She printed a picture of me with my name under it. The first profile picture I posted of me with the purple sweater and a made up smile.

Why? For what?

## 2016-08-04

The same familiar pain in the back is here again. Did I write about it yesterday?

I woke up with it. I felt it in the night while I was dreaming. At first it was just an inconvenience, then, when I was lying in the couch, a thunder of pain struck me just in the back, someone struck the wrong string in my back. Now it's less, a bad memory of this very day.

Catherine has answered my messages. She asks me about my back pain, is it strong? Will it impede to going out tomorrow?

Earlier today I confirmed with Luis tomorrow's plans. I asked him if he was sure. I told my mom, too. She just came a while ago to confirm the invitation was serious. Am I really going to take him with us? Sure. She called him just moments ago to give him the money, "for going out with Sofia".

She's trying.

When I got up and made my breakfast she was ready for going out. My grandmother asked her about it. She was going to the bank, the one close to the hospital. I thought about it, my pills are running out. The antibaby ones will be over next week. I asked her if I could give her the money and she could buy them for me. "Let's go, then".

I showered and tamed my hair. Seeing the shadow of my beard made me feel uneasy. I shaved yesterday. It was hard on my skin. I could not do it again and then later tomorrow, as well. I just put on my clothes and gave a second pass with the razor machine. This time I put on all my clothes in the bathroom, even the bra. I've been wearing it all day. It can be seen through the armholes of my tank top. All the clothes I wore today were man's. All but my underwear. The shirt, the pants, the hoodie, even the tennis. I didn't put on any make up.

What was I expecting? This happened before. Three months ago I shaved barely with a machine and wore just man's clothes and went to the blood lab to be surprised about being seen as a man.

In the bank nobody talk to me, nobody maybe even saw me.

When we got into the pharmacy, my mother ordered the sandwiches and the beverages. The four of us were in front of the cashier, but just her and me walked towards the counter of the pharmacy. This time the clerk addressed me: "I can attend you, gentleman" she said nicely.

It was a punch in the gut. I handed her my script by the name of Sofia and asked for "just the Diane", the anti-conceptive pills for woman. My mother handed her car and I gave her the money. Nobody said nothing to me. She made some comments about giving the change with the cashier but it was more awkward than uncomfortable.

We returned but just she and my grandma ate.

After Luis and my grannie left the table I asked her about the plans for this weekend. Miguel has plans, maybe, doesn't he? She wanted to go to the United States. Have I thought about if I want to buy clothes? And where?

I said the usual "I don't know" and then continued with some history. The places I've been with Catherine are Target and Ross. I've gone to Old Navy, too. And the outlets in the Las Americas Plaza. She said how some of her friends buy clothes in Ross, too. And something about a store where everything costs 5 dollars of something like that.

Was it before or after I told her I have no money? She told me she asked me because she could come with me, or maybe I could go with Catherine or something. She then mentioned how much would be 10,000 pesos. A little more than 500 dollars.

Would I really buy that much? Do I really want to?

I want to have enough clothes, I want to have a choose of what to wear. But at the same time, it bothers me the idea of committing to this body. I expect it to change. I expect it to narrow some places and get wider on others. I don't want to be seen as a gentleman no matter the clothes I wear or if I'm wearing make up or not.

I did not tell her it makes me uncomfortable looking for clothes with them.

We just let it at that we could go this weekend and just look around, see if I like something. I feel almost the same pressure of actually sending Palomino the message to set the meeting and talk about make up.

Those are things I want, that would be good. Why do they make me this nervous?

...

I walked with Luis to the Oxxo, today. I caught several pokemon that he couldn't because he had ran out of pokeballs. After paying, the cashier made some friendly comments about the bags. Exiting, there was a homeless-looking guy who opened the door for us. I handed him the coin I had in my hands. He said: "thanks, friend (feminine)"

I preferred writing about the woman in the pharmacy rather than the guy outside the oxxo. Why do I prefer to remember the things that make me sad?


## 2016-08-05

"Take this, you will go to the Mall, if you see something you like, you can buy it", she handed me several folded bills. It was 25 hundred pesos.

That was just before leaving. I exited the door and Luis was behind me. "Just don't get mad if they said "hey, beauty", being outside I pretended like I had not heard. "Why are you telling me?" "Because you're going with Sofia".

I felt a little like that other time. Coming from the shower I put on firstly the white dress I wore for the pride. I changed into the red leggings and the white blouse. Something in the reflection I did not like. I kept hearing the words of the pharmacist. Even after shaving and the make up and being sure it did not showed, I kept seeing the shadow over my lip.

I took a picture and asked for Catherine opinion. Both outfits were ok. I could use whichever I felt more comfortable in.

She had a point. I had showered my whole body to be in leggings. I decided to wear the white dress. I was all ready and yet I did not want to open the door. Both my mother and grandma had never seen me in person in a dress. What could they say? Would they make a comment? Even a compliment would upset me, but why?

She gave me the money. Maybe tomorrow we will go to the other side of the border. We drove towards Catherine's home.

I've returned from eating a taco. I was sitting in the table with everyone home. We talked. Should I change my voice even with them? The subtle changes I do with Rene or the more drastic ones like when I order something?

Do people notice the weirdness in my voice? The dispatcher from that other time gendered me female even after speaking.

I got distracted again. Catherine shared a picture from when we walked towards the museum and gardens. She tagged both my brother and me. I saw the people who have liked the photo. From there I scrolled to the new posts. One of them was a picture from the National Comission of Human Rights, it promoted the human rights of transgender, transsexual and transvestite people. I read the comments, most of them were against the picture. Why would they discriminate just mentioning trans people? Everybody has rights. Why focusing just on them... on us...

I was angry. I wanted to comment and say my point of view. Argue against their rationalizations and fallacies. What would I gain? I would not convince anyone of them just as nobody could convince me. I would just be exposed. "Why do you care? You are one, right? It's your choice if you want to chop your dick off, I don't have to see you as a woman and treat your delusion"

I do project my thoughts into my expectations of others.

We walked outside the CECUT and entered its gardens. I took pictures and shared some on snapchat. My aunts have seen them. Do they know about my trans status? I have almost none of my father's siblings. Not Alex, nor Patty, nor Martha. I have cousins, like Tiana and Xennia and Charlie and I think even his brother. Does my aunt Alma knows? One of her sons saw and liked my post.

From my mother's side there are more people, all her siblings have added me, almost all of their sons. Even some of her own cousins and their offspring. Armida, Cande, my cousins from Anaheim.

I can see some who would maybe take it differently. Cruz and her family. My uncle Alex. They are both religious. Would I be rejected when there are children near?

What would happen next time I visit my old father's house?

Tomorrow I'll might buy some clothes. Tomorrow I won't dress like a boy. I won't wear a dress either, but I won't hide.

We saw the movie. I sat in the middle just like I had imagined. It was nice, entertaining. After it we ate. Both Luis and I ordered two bowls of Ramen, just like the last time we went to the movies together. Driving there one passenger of the car besides us talked to me. He said good afternoon and kept talking. I tried to ignore him but did not know if he was still addressing me.

I remember the idea of someone else doing or saying something, but I can't recall precisely what happened.

At least I know I was seen as a girl. At least by some people.

## 2016-08-06

I'm home. I've eaten already. I finished the burrito with everyone but Luis in the table. "Do you want some sauce, m'son?". It's like getting a gentle slap to the forehead. They might not be enough to really hurt me, but they caught my attention and interrupt my thoughts, I get stopped and confused. One is just a little inconvenience, several might make me go insane.

Just before going to the table I finished putting away the clothes I bought. I should start from the very beginning.

Yesterday night I told Catherine how it was really nice to see her tag me in the picture with Luis. Being exposed, showed. Later she mentioned how in fact it is too much to her. Her friend liked the picture and they were in their house with other several people. The topic about her going to the movies came up in the conversation. She was just waiting for her friend to say something, make a comment or ask a question.

She apologized and I replied with the truth. I won't push her to do it, nor I will get sick and give her an ultimatum. Nonetheless, it does hurt. It's painful the idea that our relationship is something to be ashamed of, or maybe even me.

6 in the morning I woke up and read her message, she apologized again. But this time it was twice, and a little more, uh, crude? Bare... No...

I stayed awake. I can't remember what was it that I did. I played game boy, or read something in the internet or whatever in the tablet and or phone. I did not went back to sleep completely. An hour or two later, I got up and shower. I did not shave. I wore the red leggings and the duck t-shirt. I wore make up. It wasn't the most feminine outfit but I did try.

Grandma come with us. An hour before noon we were leaving home. The line to cross the border was by the hospital. We made a little more than two hours.

My back is hurting again.

We finally crossed. The first place was the mail. Were there mentions of my name? Or his? Did they called or refer to me in any way before the meal?

In the mail the four packages were Miguel's. Luis stayed in the car with the women. I'm tired. I see the bed with anticipation.

We went to denny's. The waiter and waitresses welcomed us but as a big group there was no single mention to me. Not until I asked for silverware. "Of course, sir", she said. Was it my voice? My face? I started doubting myself since then.

Back in the mail I saw the pepper spray and actually considered buying it. It would be useful, at least as a mean of defense, just an insurance so I could not feel as vulnerable and weak.

"Have you thought were you want to go?" Asked me my mother after I returned from the bathroom and we got up from the table. I told her the options.

I went to the bathroom. I used the woman's, but again unsure and nervous. It was empty and I actually doubt what would happen had anyone been there. Would they ask me to leave or question me? Would I defend myself?

The first place we went to was Wal Mart. All of us were together at first. When they went ahead looking for Luis materials, I stay behind and went back to the ladies department. I browsed the clothes. I grabbed a couple of blouses and a pair of pants and looked for them. After reuniting, the three of us looked.

"Iva... Son", she called me out loud. I had told Catherine before how I would correct them, explain and tell them to not misgender me in public. But I did nothing. My grandma kept referring me as son and she and my mother went back to the masculine, how I was broad by the waist and things like that.

Before the cashier I went ahead and sat in a bench. My grandma sat in the one besides. She reclined and told me how my mother saw a lot of blouses that she liked. "She saw them and saw a lot and she liked them for you, and they would look really pretty in you" She smiled and showed me the excitement my mother might had showed. It was a warm nice feeling that soon died. 'I told her back, to take it easy, with calm. 'Relax, be patient, leave HIM look for them alone by now'.


Just know she used Ivan with hesitation and then continued saying 'Sofi and Luis'.

It was not that they still see me as a man. Is that even looking for blouses and pants and shorts and woman's clothes, they kept seeing me and calling me as him. She sees me as Ivan playing dress-up.

In Target, we separated since the beginning. I went to the clothes and saw them. I felt dysphoric and nervous, exposed and uneasy. I felt everyone's eyes on me. In Wal mart as we looked for a parking stop a car passed by and a young black man said out loud: "That was ugly!", while locking eyes with me. I repeated myself over and over, how it probably, most surely, it was something completely unrelated to me. Yet again, it hurt deeply, is if it were a confirmation of my inner conflict.

Everybody came to where I was and met me after I had returned from the dressing rooms. Why did I bother modulating my voice if I was unsure how I looked?

More clothes, more.

My mother and Luis came with me. I don't mind buying clothes with my mother anymore.

Lastly, we went to Las America. I bought shoes and socks. I paid by myself. The cashier welcomed me as "you guys". It was... weird.

I took pictures of the clothes and shared them with Catherine.

Now I have options and things to wear. I won't feel like a picture or a caricature. I hope.


## 2016-08-07

I'll see Catherine tomorrow. Yesterday I bought almost a new wardrobe. My mother helped me, she gave it to me. She paid for it.

Later I can ask her for the earrings.

It was the last conversation before falling asleep. Catherine told me how she saw a queer guy in the swap meet with her mother. He was applying make up to himself. He put on a long gown and hair extensions. He looked very pretty. She thought her mother would make a face or say a mean comment like a he-she or weird guy, but even her admired his abilities. It was a salon. She thought of me, maybe I could use its services, like, for the wedding. That was the way the subject came up. I was fragile from the sights and misgendering that happened the whole day. Thinking about calling and making an appointment with the hope of being gendered feminine on the phone, going with a clean face and still be seen as a girl, expecting the best without any idea of my preference or taste. It was unnerving.

I asked her if she could go with me. No. The day of the wedding would be impossible. She'd be busy, obviously. I felt hopeless and inept. I cried thinking about the whole day and how even with all these new clothes, I'd still be the same person looking the same, getting the same sights and calls of an old name.

Was it yesterday night or today when she apologized?

I told her, explained why it made me nervous. I have no experience nor knowledge. The time presses and asphyxiates me. She said she could imagine, she felt the same about our graduation. It was just a matter of calling and setting the appointment. I projected the rage I was feeling towards her. It's harder, I have it harder. I don't sound like a woman on the phone, nor I look like one before wearing make up, nor I am one, not really, universally.

"I see you as my equal, I'm sorry"

"But I am not"

She apologized again.

I found it extremely hard to get up from bed. I had several different dreams. I shared just a fraction of them with her. I told her about our rendezvous in this bedroom of a new house. I was taking clothes off, while we lied down on the floor and kissed. I wanted to convince her to make love. She didn't want to because of the time? Or did she have to be somewhere, maybe do something. People started entering the window, friends of Miguel. I covered and put on some clothes as I welcomed them. He kept telling the rest to use the fire escape, the window. Catherine left.

Two of them came to me and asked me how it was, how did people take it. "About what?", I was confused. "Miguel told us something about you, like you have a boyfriend or something like that?" I dismissed them a little embarrassed and upset with him for telling. Something happen with the kids. There was a girl from Spain, but I have forgotten most about it.

In other dreams I was jumping between scenes and places. I was in session with a therapist. I could appear to myself 5 years in the past and actually talk and say something. I convinced myself of talking to the therapist for something. Was me from the present going to the me from before everything appeared? Did I tell myself what would happen? Was I trying to make the transition easier or actually stop it altogether?

I don't remember.

My grandma told me to try the blouse on so she could do the fixes. I wore a bra and put it on inside out. She knocked on the door. "I actually betted you would open it without knocking" my mother told her. She put the pins in and I took it.

It was then that we had the conversation, I guess, me and Catherine. I cried again. I slept a little with the music from the tablet soothing my slumber. I was fallen in dreams when I hear the door and saw her. "Sofia", she called, as if she had practiced it. "Were you asleep (feminine)?" She corrected it in the last minute. I put it one for her to see it was fit. This time she didn't leave the room.

"Were you wearing a bra?, well it doesn't change much, does it?"

Later, in Luis room, my mother would come while he and my mother were there as well. I asked her for a ride tomorrow to the crossing border. They talked about yesterday, a woman they saw. "She was wearing this thing, it was dark red, burgundy, like wine. The sleeves were a little loose until here, and then they were open and falling. It came down to the legs and had flow. The sleeves covered it as it danced in the movement. I could make you something like that. You might like it".

She saw it and told my mom she could do something similar. "I don't like dresses, mum". "Do you think maybe they might like it?" and pointed at me.



## 2016-08-08

I got up and got ready. Everything was set. I postponed the alarmed and then disarmed it before it could start. Catherine was already in school. I was going to be leaving home by noon. We would meet crossing the border. She asked me if I could leave home an hour earlier. She thought she might go for the pass in her free hour. Someone was in the bathroom. I didn't think I could make it. It was my grandmother. Did she know? My mother said she might want to accompany us. Ans she did. The three of us left a couple of minutes after eleven. I wore the pants that look like jeans and the Mickey Tshirt. I told my mother I would exchange a fifteen hundred. She gave me two hundred dollars in return. In the way there, my mom told me how she was talking with my godmother. She said that it was good that she now has someone to tell her what she can and can't wear. And the four of us can go shopping now.

It feels weird hearing those kind of comments. I longed for a long time being included in a feminine plural. "Las cuatro". Why does it feel condescending, now? My mom is struggling, she wants to. She tells Luis to ask Sofia what to eat, and then when I give my answer, she tells my grandma Ivan said it.

Should I put a new counter of the days since Monica crosses my mind? Just seeing it would be reason enough to restart it. That's a stupid idea. Counting the days of indifference is ironic. Were I really apathetic I would not care about that number.

They left me and I walked. I had not to stop until I reached the booth. The CBP officer asked me "Where are you going?" even before I handed him my ids. I answered, "San Ysidro" with a normal voice. "What will you do?", "shopping". "What do you bring with you?" "Nothing, just me". He clicked in the profile that appeared on his screen. Looked at the card and then said as he looked at me: "Jos..." and stopped suddenly. His eyes were locked with mine and opened at the same time his voice went silent. He just handed them to me and told me to go. I walked and exited on the other side.

I waited for half an hour, maybe a little less. I was sitting in a bench when I noticed the girl in blue looking at me. She recognized me and smiled. I stood up and went to meet her. "It's been a lot since I've seen you", we kissed on out cheeks and asked how we've been. "Are you waiting for someone?", and she left. Jacqueline. She met me when I had four or five years. We shared the classroom with Jessica, she's one of her closest friends in jr high. Did she see me as a woman? Did she see that same boy but grown?

Why did I imagined her telling to her mate "You see that person I just said hi to? He is a man, I met him when he went by Ivan"

I walked to the old pedestrian crossing and met Catherine in the trolley station. I paid for my daily pass. We went to the adult school and she bought hers. We ate in chipotle. I wanted to go to in n out. I felt like it. She didn't tell me not to go, she offered to go to both places. I declined.

We went to Target, after there we could go to Ross and then Las Americas. That was the plan. We gave a round through the ladies' section. I tried on two blouses of different sizes but took none. I bought a pair of black oxfords. I didn't need them. I needed shoes for the wedding. I need the dress for both it and the graduation.

I was browsing the underwear after we talked about how most of mine was somewhen hers.

"Sofi, I have to go", she tried putting on the audio but I heard nothing. The aunt of his father had died. Of course we should return. I paid for the shoes and went to the trolley.

Crossing back to Mexico, the frustration hit me. It's a month until the wedding and again I have nothing. I spent 40 dollars and haven't gotten anything ready. The day is getting closer and I don't know what I will do or wear.

It wasn't just that. I was upset but had no right to those feelings. Her fucking grand aunt just died, what did I expect? For her to stay and accompany me?

I was angry at myself every time I confronted my own emotions.

Even now, I don't know where all this anger comes from and to whom it's directed.

## 2016-08-09

Tomorrow I'm supposed to see Rene for my session. What has happened this week?

I know I've had several different dreams. Most of them present the theme of me being recognized as a woman. Either by Paola asking for Ivan to be the team leader and the professor agreeing picking the boy next to me, "and this girl", pointing at me. In others, like the one from this morning, I was in this new house. They were some animals, a cat and a dog. Exploring the rooms in it, I stepped into the bathroom to see this weird machine full of complicated adjustments and apparatus. I came to the realization that it was for me. I would need help, I wouldn't be able to get up. I would be sick.

Yesterday was I angry? I was upset... disappointed. My mother asked me to see what I bought. I showed her the shoes and she seemed a little let down. "They're like, for wearing with jeans, right?" Today she asked me, when we were alone in the living room: "What kind of clothes do you like?" For what? generally or for a certain occasion? Why? She just asked again as if it were an obvious question. Then she explained. When I bought clothes, the were mostly discreet colors, t-shirts. She would imagine I'd get, I don't know, dresses, or skirts.

Maybe she was projecting her expectations of me being a transgender woman. She might have thought I'd be desperate to wearing the most feminine clothes I could find.

But I just chose the things which I know, the colors I am used to. I have to be exploring slowly what kind of clothes I like and what kinds look good on me.

Was it yesterday or today when they again started talking about this saturday? Chevo has gotten his house ready. He said "girls, let's start giving suggestions for the movies you want to see". Does he sees the rest of us as girls, now? Am I part of that specification?

Is it a natural progression or have they talked about it? Maybe I do look different.

Yesterday my mother talked to me and asked me about the hormones. She shared a little of what she's learned in the youtube videos. I have changed, she came to the conclusion herself after asking myself for my experience. The saturday I wore leggings, my legs looked bigger. "you were not that leggy [masculine]" My butt has grown, as well. Catherine would later confirm it, too, when I told her this evening. She saw me yesterday.

Today it's the funeral, the wakening?. I don't know the word. Tomorrow will be the mass in the morning.

I brought the subject again, would see us tomorrow or would she prefer thursday or friday? I had to know the plans she would have.

The phone just rang. I stepped up from my chair and looked at the number. I have decided not to answer. I am not comfortable. Edgar is the one calling. What name should I answer with? "Hi, who's this?" "Edgar, hey, shortie... how's it been?"

No. I am not ready. I am nervous. Even talking with them on the phone makes me anxious. I asked what we would do in the weekend. My father having the call-on phone was a relief. My mother wanted to go. She even bought a swim suit. She did not push to me the idea of picking one. I don't know how would I had reacted.

"Hello, who's this... Laura?" "No, it's Sofia"...

I wouldn't had.

Luis answered the phone earlier today. It was a courier saying he had a package for Jose Luis. Anyone could pick it up. I grabbed my keys and wallet. They might want an id and signature.

I opened the door before I could get the meaning of his "you don't need to sign". He handed me the envelope and just asked for my name. Which one could I give him? How was I seen? Why did I make no mention of that worry to my mom?

I don't feel comfortable wearing extremely feminine clothes because I worry about the way people see me. I feel at ease wearing androgynous ones, it's safer this ambiguos zone. I hate wearing a dress and being called "sir" or "he".

He just annotated Ivan Fernandez and left.

I asked Catherine if I'd need to go dressed as a boy to the funeral or church. She told me she did not know.

Her family, that part of the family doesn't know about me. On the other hand she has not talked with her parents. Depends of the answer I get from Rene I might go to the church or she invited me to come home.

"I'm sorry, I'd prefer going until after you've talked with them"

The idea, thought of her saying she's going with Ivan, talking about his family, his invitations, makes me sick.

Today, my grandmother did not say Ivan once. It was always Sofi.

Why was it not enough? What more do I want?

## 2016-08-10

How long has it been since the last time I was at Catherine's home?

Just one week before the last session. Maybe next week I'll attend after going to the laboratory to get my blood drawn and my levels checked. This week it was before Catherine's grand uncle burial.

"Would your brother be jealous? Do you think he would like me?"

I got up from a peculiar dream. I can't remember even its theme. The alarm woke me up before 9. Today's meeting would be two hours before my usual time. I showered and dressed. Catherine asked me yesterday if I'd accompany her. I discarded the idea of wearing gray and red. I put on the burgundy pants and a gray tank top under the gray-striped white shirt. I put make up. Catherine and I would be leaving our homes almost at the same time. The mass would be around 10:30. I showed her a picture of my outfit before I hesitated and decided to change. I put on a green blouse and tried a gray thin cardigan. I went back to the original.

I looked androgynous. It was a male shirt. The pants were skinny and tapered to my legs. The neck of the tank was low enough for the curves of my young breasts to be noticeable. Leaving the shirt opened the feminine attributes were more obvious, closing it, I found almost no difference to the me from months ago.

I walked to Rene with time to spare. The needle was threatening to hug the E signaling an empty tank. I parked the car and spent the 5 pesos coin that survived in the pocket of my purse for who knows how long.

I don't think I talked about anything important with Rene. I am thinking again about leaving him. This time I don't consider it a good idea to mention it to Catherine. I should tell him, though. Why don't I want to go? Do I feel I'm not working anything? The graduation and the wedding are close. I haven't seen my family. I have no job nor patients.

I haven't started the slides for the course nor the project proposal for the investigation. I haven't even started to research for my themes of interests nor for the requisites for the master program.

Next week I'll see the endocrinologist. Will I dare to mention my want to change medication? What is it that scares me so much about speaking up?

From Rene I drove to the graveyard. I had never gone to one here in Tijuana. Catherine was waiting me inside close to the tent were her family was gathered. Nobody gendered me today. Yeah, some did, just not the way I desired.

"Has Sofia left yet?"

Her mother welcomed and greeted me. "Son". "Ivan".

I was not introduced to anyone else of her family. I stood next to her and held her hand. I saw the crude emotions of the people who were mourning. Some spoke. One, the first woman who did, talked more about god than the woman herself. It was all about her strength who was because of her faith and fear for god and devotion to him.

"What would you like for when you die?"

I don't want a bishop or a priest near my casket. I don't want no mention of god in my death. All of you can pray for me, but do it in your own houses. God was never in my life, please don't bring him to my death.

I feel resentment. But how fair is it?

I'm not mad at God. Not really. Would he really exist, what has he done to me to be so mad about? Give me the wrong body, an incorrect childhood? No. I hate his followers. They deny me. The pope talks against me. I don't want no mention of heaven or eternal glory. I want them to remember my life, our memories.

I looked at the tombs spread in the ground and all of those names. I said nothing, but I feared about my own. What name would they put on there?

Maybe ashes is a better option for me. I spent almost my whole life in discord with my own body. Both men and woman's ashes are the same.

We visited the tomb of his brother and then went home. Her dog didn't recognized me at first. She's getting blind, but ran to me and sniffed me. Did her cousin recognized me?

Everyone told him my name wrong. Will he grow and get used to that wrong name as almost all of Catherine's family?

## 2016-08-11

"Good afternoon, brave! How's your life in this your renew life? I hope your surroundings are more supportive and tolerant than what I've seen in Spain on occasions"

I woke up to the friend request of Arantxa on my profile. She sent me some messages and we chatted for a while.

I slept and rested nested and knotted inside the sheet. It was hard getting back up. I hadn't thought about it like this, but I have the motivation every morning of rising and start the day with another dose of hormones. New changes, a new stick in the counting of this new life. For months I saw the transition as a distant future. It's been months since that day come. Half a year I've been 23, half a year since I dared to make the call and set the appointment. Three months passed until I got in. Another three months since then. More than a hundred days changing.

In the evening I was talking with Catherine after her return from classes.

"Cari, your mom knows I won't attend the wedding in a suit, doesn't she?"
"Uh, she didn't, but I guess she does now"

She had passed her the phone to show her a picture. It vibrated in her hands. The message appeared on the upper side of the screen. She must had looked at it. I asked her if she said something. She did not. Is it active denial? I'm her daughter's partner.

Later I asked her if she would say something. She told me she would, but it doesn't comfort me any more. Is it that I don't believe her? She has to. She can't not do it. What is it that I fear? At first it was about just being with my family, standing besides them, facing them and seeing their reactions. I've done it. I've seen them face to face and confronted their reactions, or would if there had been any.

Now it's her parents. They've seen me, too. The greeted me and welcomed me to their home. I showed androgynously yet I looked feminine. They called me Ivan, still, they used male pronouns. It hurts, it's painful. Do I have a right to ask her?

Is this something I will have to deal with constantly?

What will it be when the day comes, and they have to welcome my family at the reception. How will I introduce myself to their family? Will they greet me as Ivan? Even with make up and a night gown will they see me as her boyfriend? Will the other people who've already met him recognize his profile in my face?

Next week I'll catch up to her in the other side of the border again. I have to look for a dress and shoes. I might look for a handbag. Other stuff to look for are underwear and a belt.

I'm nervous about the make up and the hair and the clothes and her family and my own. The wedding is scary.

This weekend I'll see the gang. Catherine will come pick me up and she will give them the invitations. After it we'll drive to Playas and pick up a pizza. I'll bring the bottle of spanish sidra. We'll meet then in Chevo's house. Do his parents worry me as well? What if they say something? Will they recognize me? It's more about his mother than his father. Do they know? Has he told them? Maybe he already mentioned my situation and uses my name.

I congratulated Felipe for his birthday. I sent him the message in the morning after talking with Arantxa. Just moments ago he responded it. "Thank you very much, Sofia. It's time for a meeting with the mate (Manuel) or what?" He tagged him so he came and commented as well.

Will the meeting really take place? Why did I get nervous? Two weeks have passed since Aidee proposed to help me with make up. I haven't answer. We met outside the bars the time I went out with the girls. "Chat me to set up the meeting". I didn't. Will I?

I could use her. It would be really helpful. It's something I need. Why do I avoid her?

Does seeing Manuel and Felipe scare me? Is it their reactions or their questions? They both accepted me and sent me a friend request. He used my name. There should be no reason to worry.

Catherine asked me if I had commented to my mom about the course we saw in Mexicali. I didn't. Seeing Edgar scares me as well. Facing him.

Maybe I wasn't as ready as I thought.

No. It had to be done. I would had never been ready enough.

## 2016-08-12

"Write about me today"

How long have we known each other? Recently there were some Facebook posts where people shared a little video about their friendship. "Today's the 5th anniversary of them being friends", or something like that. Do we have that time?

She was the one who talked to me first. She approached me in the classroom and started the conversation. "We were in the same highschool, I've seen you before". Later she would confess to me how I came sort of dismissive and kind of an asshole. I remember the day, and remember seeing her, but I can't recall what I thought or felt. Would I ever imagine the conversations we would later have? Could I even imagine that we'd share nights and beds and clothes and even our bodies?

"What about you?" I asked her. She didn't know. Just talk about her, describe her, narrate times where she was adorable or that make me laugh.

She remembered when I brought both of us to the floor after getting my foot stuck in the loop of her backpack. People saw us and came to help. I scrape my knee. We both laughed almost all the way to her car from the japanese restaurant of pizza. Adorable moments are when I give her little kisses in her cheeks or her head.

What do I think about?

I go to bittersweet moments. I guess it's in my nature to find home in sadness. But they're not tragic.

We were in first semester, the workshop of Fidel. In one I silently represented a dream where I feel everyone looking down on me. They answered me back with movements as well. She reassured me.

It was a different one, where she cried. Had I known about her accident? Was it something related to her brother? I just remember understanding. Again, without a word I went to her and I hugged her. There was no need to say anything.

I could count the classes we did not share with my fingers the whole 9 semesters we studied. We would almost always seat close. Whenever I would be in front, her fingers would find a way to my hair. They'd hide in there, exploring the different paths hidden in my curls.

We ran twice. It was the first time we went out together. Was it? Didn't we to go Ensenada before that, to the conference that Juan Carlos invited us to? It was our first travel, the first outer city we would explore. The race was in fourth semester. We ended up all colored. I would meet her father that day. It was the first time he saw me as Ivan. Then I was just her friend.

In fourth semester I think I had a girlfriend still. Even then we would use our free time to be together. That was the semester we spent without Anahi. Whenever a class would be cancelled, or other times were we would skip it, we would go to Playas. I remember those times and relate them with coldness and warmth. We both wore coats, hats and beanies. My hair was getting longish. Did we start talking about my secret yet? We would go to Argana and smoke and talk. We did not kiss until the next semester, before we left the country.

I didn't have a girlfriend anymore, but I got another best friend. We started sharing nights without being really with each other. We talked and talked and when we ran out of stuff to say, we shared our inner shadows. With her, I lost my fear to my darkness.

I had a mixture of confusing feelings. My inner self was a battleship of ideas and conflicting emotions. She got caught in the fire.

We kissed in that cafe I once joked would be the central perk of our group of Friends. Even now we still go to that same cafe. We still kiss. But our kisses are no longer experimental or careful. They're not controlled or surprising. They're messy, they're warm, they're passionate and confident. They're playful and calm.

We both have changed. I am not the same person she met.

She has grown in my eyes. I look at her and see beauty. I love her caring eyes and the roundness of her cheeks when she smiles at me.

We would go late at night after class and sat in the reclined seats of her car. The windows frosted. There was coldness in those times. We talked and talked and the words would cover us and entertain us. Our hands would meet between us. Her fingers would end up being entwined between mine. Even in the coldness of the nights I always found warmth with her.

The clothes are all set and put in big bags. Several of the jeans my mom is discarding are 14 in size. I thought about Catherine's size. Would they fit? I decided not to say anything, if they did, maybe she would take them.

I set the alarm thinking we would go to the restaurant to have breakfast. I woke up and heard my dad leaving and coming back. The rustling of the paper back convinced me that we would not really go. Everyone was in bed or asleep. I ate and took my pills.

I returned to bed and fell asleep for an hour. I was tired and exhausted. It was past midnight when I was trying to sleep. The lights outside of my bedroom where lit and plastic sounds squeaked rhythmically. Maybe they came from my mother, maybe it was Miguel or my grandma.

I showered a little after noon. Today is the day that they're going to cut the water. Catherine will come pick me up. She'll leave her home at 5 in the afternoon. It's two and a half hours from now.

When I put my underwear and the towel in the bathroom I noticed that Luis' door was locked. What was he doing? The first thought that cross my mind was when I used to lock mine last year as I tried on the clothes I bought or borrowed. I didn't want to risk someone opening the door and seeing me.

Did not one of them notice ever?

Luis did. Luis touched my back and his finger landed just on the closure of the bra. "Are... are you wearing a bra?" He was confused and startled, his words came as if he didn't even believe he was asking that.

I denied it and crouched on my chair.

i tried to open the door and he said he was changing. I brushed my teeth and showered. In there I untangled and washed my hair again, shaved both my armpits and chest, soaped my whole body and shave my legs. After exiting and drying my body I shaved my face.

Yesterday my mother shared: "Your godmother said: 'just tell Sofia to pluck her eyebrows and not let them grow like yours". My grandmother said nowadays girls leave them thick. Then said I don't need to. My mother continued saying I would say I already do. "Do you?"

I have and haven't. I take the stranded hairs that I see but I don't dare to change their form. They're thick and manly. They're natural. They're fine by now.

I didn't bother to put on the gray jeggings and black blouse. I put the hose shorts I did and over them the jeans-like pants. On top I wore the black casual blouse my grandmother looked for me just like my mother's. This is what I am going to wear to Chevo's house. It's neutral. Neutral-like. A little androgynous. Would their parents see me as Ivan or as me? Do they know? Will they see me?

I am a little nervous. Catherine will give my parents the invitations to the wedding today. She'll be arriving in three hours.

When I came down and put my clothes and face, I hesitated before opening the door. Will I always have this uncertain feeling? Like grabbing air and courage before going into the dark cave and face my demons, except I'm not going in, I'm getting out.

Everybody here knows and have seen me already. What do I fear?

In the table was Luis and my mother, both wearing headphones and busy in their tablets. I asked Luis if he showered. When I got out of the shower his door was still locked. It was way too much to be changing. He said he did before me. He narrated all of his actions from waking up to being in the table talking to me.

"Because we did not get up in the morning we didn't go to eat breakfast, but we will go to dinner."

Is that why my mom was blowdrying her hair just now? I won't change outfit will I? I'll stay like this. Do I look feminine? Do I look casual? Will I be out of place in there?

What if time goes short and we don't get to come in before Catherine's? What if this is the waiter that gets to be the first one to say something offensive? What if I get called femininely before my father corrects them? What if I get called masculinely and it hurts?

Will it be my fault for not going fully feminine? Is this going to be always a necessity to be seen?

Do my clothes define me now?



## 2016-08-14

It is a tiring day. I'm exhausted. Again I was the second person to get up from bed. I might had been the first one to wake.

Yesterday we did leave. At first I had come to the conclusion that I would have to stay here alone waiting for Catherine. I had gone upstairs to see how my mother was doing. It was three in the afternoon. She said how my grandmother was not hungry so we might go to the movies first. I couldn't. Catherine would pick me up, I had mentioned it.

Even if we weren't going to the movies I couldn't make it back on time.

We did leave. We went to the restaurant my mother had said. Los Jarrones. It was a mexican place. They offered us buffet or the carte. We could stand up and take a look before deciding. I took their offer and went with my mother and grandma. I was the first to return and the table was almost empty. Just my dad was sitting.

"So, is it going to be carte, lady?", said the waitress before I took it.

We ate.

I had the jeans and the t-shirt and was seen as a woman, I think.

Catherine came for me an hour after we got home. I went for her and accompanied her home. She greeted my family and gave them the invitations. The bags of my mother's clothes were in the living room. She explained how they counted 5 of us but if my grandma decided to stay for those times I could just tell her and they'll give her another reception.

"Yeah, Sofi can just tell me", she would later tell me how it felt uncomfortable when they looked at her after saying my name. My father took his eyes from the table and pointed them at hers. My mum and grandma looked at her disbelieved. It would make me feel worse now that we touched the subject just moments ago.

She drove us to Chevo's. We make a stop first in the pizza place. She waited by the car and I ordered the pizza. I gave them my name. They didn't deny it nor made any face or comment. They wrote it down. The one who took my money was going to gender me but stopped. Did I feel their discomfort or was I just projecting mine?

The owner of the place was managing the orders and receipts. He took my pizza and called my name. They looked directly at me as I was sitting in front of them. They just handed it. Would they talk about me after my leaving? Did they notice? Do I have something to notice and talk about?

With Chevo we were the first ones to arrive. Paola was the second and last one. We ate dinner and drank wine as adults. We chatted and laughed. We bought snacks and watched a movie. It was the first gathering Chevo organized and hosted in his home. He felt proud. We should feel proud for being the firsts. He used the plural feminine several times, lots more than before.

Even when we said our good-byes, I think I heard the sound of his kiss as he hugged me. "How did you feel?" asked Catherine as I told her. It was weird, new, uncomfortable. Men don't kiss good-bye. I am not a man. I am a woman. It should be normal.

I hesitated before greeting his dad for that same reason. Did he recognize me? Would he give me his hand or his cheek? Would I want to know?

Today was a slow and tiring day. I feel the pressure of the absence of things to do. I feel useless and inept. A lifeless bag of bones and meat. No function nor desires.

I told my parents about the course in Mexicali. Catherine told theirs. At first it was an euphoric excitement. We could spend the nights together again. Then it hit me. She told them she could stay with me, except she didn't talk about me. She used Ivan. Because they know Ivan.

I asked her and she confirmed it. Today my father said it, too. Twice. He has never used the name and I don't think I'll hear him soon. My mother, to him, used Ivan as well. Was it on purpose? Was it a slip just like my grandma's?

It didn't use to bother me this much.

She felt bad when I asked. And I said I feel bad every time I hear it.

"I feel like pressure"

"I feel like my name doesn't matter, as if it's just a whim or a game. That it's a nickname and Ivan is my "real name". I feel pain and misunderstood and loneliness. I just want to go where I won't have to ask, where no one knows me as Ivan. Where it'll stop being my other name and it will just be who I am."

She saw them but said nothing. She might be asleep just now.

## 2016-08-15

The night is heavy and warmth. It's been a long and hot day. Today's biggest moments were unexpected.

Yesterday night was hard. I forgot to restart the counter of the days since I cried. We were talking about the course in Mexicali. Today after my mother came, in the table I told them about Catherine's plan to go, too. My grandmother said we could all stay home. Later, my mom asked me: "More than how will you sign up, how will you sign up as? Ivan or Sofia?" It was a gut-punching reminder of yesterday's conversation.

It all started because of that. I asked her for her plans of calling to the lab in Mexicali. She replied saying I have to call, as well. She doesn't know if they'll let her sing both of us in. "And I don't know which name you'll use"

I didn't either. "Ivan, I guess", and my stomach turned upside down and fell how it fell to my feet. She apologized. I confessed that I didn't know anymore if I wanted to go. I thought about it, how will my voice sound? Will I sign as Sofia with a female voice? If it is not convincing enough? What will happen if they ask for an id or a certification? Or if I give my legal name, what will happen when I go and ask for my badge or seat or whatever... Will I dress as a boy? As a girl?

I hate being in this limbo.

I remembered hearing my mom changing name and pronouns near my father. It was a twist to the dagger in my chest. "When you told your parents, did you say you could stay with Ivan's grandma?"

"Yes" I shared the memory of my mother's turn around. She said she barely had time with her parents. My question made her feel bad, guilty. I feel bad every time I hear that name. She felt pressure. And I told her...

I remember how this were yesterday last words. She did answer after that.

She knows how I feel, that is painful. She doesn't like having to say stuff, hers, mine, whoever's. I wished I had never been their son and never had been her boyfriend.

"We've talked about this before, there is nothing else to do. I feel bad, that it was wrong, introducing you as Ivan. I want to be calm with those choices, we both took them, you agreed. You make me feel so guilty, regretful, just bad..."

"I was your boyfriend, that doesn't matter anymore. I just want to stop being him. You said you would break up with him and today you talked about going to his house."

"I can't do it as fast as you wish"

"It's been almost half a year", that was a low punch.

She exploded and I fell to a dark pit of hopelessness and misery. We went to sleep.

The morning I was still in the hole. I had no energy nor will to get up.

I took my breakfast and pills and return. I lied down and listened to music. Then a song started interrupting the ipad. For a long time I related the game of thrones ring tone to an intro call. This time the melody was different. It brought me back to that arabic cafe where we lie in pillows and smoke shisha. It wasn't a memory, it was a call. It was Liliana. She wanted to ask me two things. I forgot the first one... and the second one as well, now.

She wanted to reunite us to a work meeting, and see how I appear on Facebook so she can add me to a group chat.

Yesterday it was all about the frustration of being stuck with this name and persona. I can't apply to jobs or courses. I can't do shit without showing this incongruence. It's tiring and irritating and I'm so sick of this.

And now here it was, more job, things to do, meetings.

The day after tomorrow, I'll go to the lab again in the morning. From then, depends of what Rene says I might go to therapy or skip it until next week and go to the meeting.

Thursday I'll get to her crossing the border just like last week. Except this time I'll let the car in a parking lot. I hope. We might look for dresses or clothes. I still have to find what I'm going to wear.

Aidee talked to me today. She started the conversation and I apologized for not reaching out to her. We established the day of our meeting and talked about stuff, how has her life been, and how has mine.

I'll see her by the end of this month, the next day of the saturday I'll meet with the gang by Catherine's.

## 2016-08-16

She talked about all the pressures she has. It all started because of a proposal. If we return early from the United States, can we go to Argana?

"Argana and that other stuff, later". I understand, of course, that's all she needed to say. I apologized about the plans. It was just an offer. I have been mentioning. Do I feel like talking? I want to relax, I need to relax... I have been a little intense, I guess...

She continued listing all the things she has to do, she feels pressure and swallowed in time. Going to Mexicali is going to cost her another week here. I asked her if she's so filled why did she mention the course? We should not see each other until we leave for Mexicali. I went to the bathroom to take a shower. I left the phone on purpose so I would not see immediately after her reply.

Just moments ago I was sitting in my bed with the tank wet and my hair dripping. I used the old red one that I was wearing to take the excessive water from the bun of curls that was tied in the back of my neck. He walked step by step towards my room, as if his shadow were securing the perimeter first. He stood by the doorframe and asked if I had gone out today.

Did I? No. I didn't. Will I go out tomorrow? Yeah, and the day after, too.

"Will you be here by the afternoon so we take your mother to dinner?"

Sure. My Thursday just got free.

"Are you mad?", was the first message I read from her. Was I? Am I now? I felt something, I still do.

The last one she sent said "I got upset. I don't want to say anything to you now"

She's been typing since I came to this chair and started these words. I, on my end, am trying to decipher how and what am I feeling.

...I am a little upset. Your messages and everything lately makes me feel like my pressures don't matter ...

She answered and I went there. My head hurts still. Today, I won't be... no, I can't eat anymore. I have to fast until tomorrow morning. Maybe it's that, maybe is the crying.

"I think about the wedding and I feel impotence. I feel I have no right to be upset or angry about your parents and family because it hurts you and you've apologized already and I know you're pressured. At the same time, though, I think how you don't feel the pain I do.
I can't be mad at you, so I don't know at who direct my anger or even what to feel"

Today I had several dreams. I narrated them to her.

In the first one I knew we were being hunted and looked for. I was in this house or the one in Otay... no, it was this one. My father was in the living room. I had all my things ready and we had to leave now. I now see the image of the Predator monster of that movie, an alien whose whole intention is hunt and kill. We were prey and I could feel it in every pore of my skin. I wanted to get away from here. There was no presence or mention of either Luis nor my mother. My father knew about our circumstances, but he acted is if it were nothing. I urged him, begged him to move, and he just called Miguel. I returned to my bedroom to get everything in order. Time passed, seconds that feel like minutes. I came back, crying, and my father called my brother screaming. There was no answer.

The dream changed. This time I was with my mother and we were waiting for my dad. He was in a convenience store upstair. The menace was the same, something of the like. "We have to go, if he hasn't returned, there must be a reason." My mother wanted to wait, but time passed and the danger was closer. "I'll look for him" and get out of the van. I walked the stairs cautiously. There were shatters of glass on the floor and a silent darkness that forewarn tragedy. Crouching, I came close to the door until a quiet beeping preceded the gunshots that passed over my head. There was no point in checking inside the store. I returned to the car and asked my mother to go.

There was a change in dream where Catherine was with me. We were still in the car and there was a chase. The danger was different, it was no longer supernatural or a monstrosity, it was more tangible and real. I had came to contact with it, maybe because of that.

For a reason we ended up in prison. We were captured by the police, not our hunters. Were they hunting her as well or just me? My mother was no longer with us, I think. We were there, in cells, literally trapped now. Waiting for they to catch us. I think somebody else came, one with a pistol. I saw the guard and ran towards him. I no longer feared the threat of being shot. My destiny had they caught me would have been worse. I took the gun from him and with it made an exit path for both Catherine and me. The man had company now, or maybe were the guards that wanted to get to us, as well. They pointed at us and shot. I tried to shoot, too, but nothing came from the gun. It was empty, useless. I was defenseless. We got into a car chase, a bizarre and surreal car chase.

The dream changed to a more realist one. We got out from certain kind of station. It was a new place, a new city. With us there were no luggage but the feeling of momentary relief and safety. I had still the gun in my bag. There were big and ancient looking buildings surrounding us. We walked and saw a certain kind of show, there were people dancing. It was an arabic dance, and in the multitude, lots of familiar faces appeared. I saw them and wondered if they could see me, too. Could they recognize me? Was I in danger?

I saw the outfit most of the girls were wearing and for the first time in the night I fell the familiar dread of dysphoria. I came conscious of the clothes that enveloped my body and the discordance of my projected identity.

We agreed to separate for a while. I should look for bullets and meet with someone who could give us new identities. I would meet her in the plaza some time later. And walking out of the scene I was the actor who, exiting the stage disassociates from the character he plays and returns to reality. I was still in a dream, but where the hell could I do somethings? Where could I go, whom could I meet?

I wandered to lose time and looked at the woman singing opera and the marching band of people dressed in purple. Time passed and I returned to Catherine. She stood in front of a statue. Her arms gliding in the air and his body dancing slowly to the tune of the singing. Her eyes were closed. She was wearing a different dress, it was blue. She looked beautiful and elegant in her musical trance. I came to her and told her everything was done.

The marching band surrounded us and passed us by. Inside them, we smiled.

"Do we have a class now?" "Yeah, in a couple of minutes", she answered as if it was a rational question. "We should go now, then" I said before I extended my hand and we left, who knows where to do who knows what.

## 2016-08-17

Tomorrow I won't be going to the United States after all. I asked Catherine, if she wanted to go just a couple of hours before we return early, but she said it was better to go another day.

I'm wearing the red jeans I bought in Target and the white and black blouse of Wal-mart. I was seen as a girl in the lab. This time the receptionist was a man. He was just cordially nice enough. He received my payment and confirmed my fast and asked about the way I'd like my results. Finally he assured, utilizing the feminine pronoun, that I'd be called.

I showered after my dad and Miguel left home. My mother asked me, where would I be going so early. I reminded her. I was already in the car when I realized I didn't have the remote to open the gate. I returned to the house and opened the mitsubishi to get my mother's remote and open the door. After leaving the keys in the table, I exited.

I got to the lab in a couple of minutes and was called to get my blood drawn. I felt clumsy knocking my bag to the wall after hanging it and then pushing the chair as I sat. The phlebotomist asked for my medication and made notes of them. After saying the names of the pills she looked up as if remembering what are they. I used the marketing names instead of the generic.

She took my blood and wished me a good day. The man who welcomed me ran to get the door for me. I walked towards the supermarket looking for a chocolate milk box and a packet of cookies. I found neither of them. I ended up buying a bottle of coffee flavored milk.

I drove home and my grandmother received me. I waited until it was time to therapy.

In there I did not know where to start.

My mother talked to me again, she asked me what happened with the psychologist that supervises, what was the conclusion to my asking what is going to happen with my patients. With my grandma then they confirmed how I do have changes. "I told her, 'call her, call her'... she looks beautiful".

With Rene I talked about Catherine's conversations this week. I even forgot to talk about Saturday's dinner at Chevo's. The end of the session was with the interpretation of my dreams. He added new things. "What was the alien? Who was the monster?" He asked me twice.

"Sofia!", you ran from it, and it took, killed your dad. You ended up in prison, because of it.

It didn't fit completely, until I fixed it. The threat changed across the dreams it turned more and more real. At first it was a monster and abstract, it was the chaotic future I expected, the "sickness" I feared. It turned more and more real until it became people, society.

When the purple march overcame us, Rene said it could be the pride parade.

From there I drove to Lili's. Catherine was already there. A minutes before the start of the meeting came Gilda. She knows me, she does have me in Facebook. She said hi like any other person would. There would be a fourth, a different one than the one who had seen me before.

She met me and said nothing. Lili never messed up and kept referring to all of us as women.

I came home. Then my mother did. I was in bed watching a video when, now I know, my grandmother asked her to call me so she could see me. She came and sat here, we talked a little about tomorrow's dinner.

It was later, when she called me again: "What do you propose?" I went and stood in the bar of the kitchen. "About what?" "We have to let Ivan go". She started crying silently and covering her face.

I sat besides her and the talk start.

She told me how she feels trapped between all of us, she wants to take care of the whole family. She sees me now, smiling and happy. And she sees too how after my dad calls me Ivan, the life out of my face fades away. She sees how whenever she calls me Sofia, the face of my dad changes as well.

We talked about that, how they still see Ivan in the couch, wearing his shorts and tank and his hair in a bun. She loved him, she will miss him.

The talk was long, and the thought of remembering it again bring tires me.

She asked me several times what could we do, how could we make this easier. Was therapy an option? The question scared me. How would it be to go all of us to therapy. I imagined what would I do. I don't do therapy, it's not my expertise and yet I had several ideas. I planned this whole dynamic.

Five chairs, Two for the brothers, two for the parents and one for the grandma. Then another two. In the first one, I would sit. This is Ivan. Then, the therapist would add another chair. But she is in the wrong seat. She belongs her, as the sister. This is Sofia. For 23 years she sat here, in his place, but finally she is were she belongs.

The chair would be empty. Everyone of us, would have a turn to say whatever they want to the empty seat. My mother would say how she loved me, and was proud of me, and she will always remember and cherish the time we spent together. My father maybe would open up and asked me not to go. He would say he wanted the very best for me. He'll miss me. My brothers maybe would say how they admired me and looked up to my achievements. They'll never forget what they learned from me. Finally it would be my turn. I would talk to the empty chair and tell him, that I was in his place, he was sad and he didn't enjoy life. He always thought about his family and wanted to be the very best to them. I could no longer fill his shoes. I would be me, and I know I'm taking his place, but I love him, anyway. I know he did what he could do, and it was the best. I'll never deny him.

Then, everyone would a have a turn to say something to me, in this chair, now my place. They could say how they accept me and love me. They could say lots of things that I don't want to pretend to know. Finally, in an act of closure, they would take the chair away. His chair is gone. We are the family that we are now.

How does everyone feel after Ivan's departure?

Should I take the chair before they talk to me in my new seat? Should I seat in Ivan's place to hear what they have to say to him, or hear it from my new seat? What is more powerful, to see me change seats or to talk to an empty one?

Why do I worry about it, if this is something I wouldn't bear to actually do?

## 2016-08-18

I'm home. This is my family. I congratulated my mom for her birthday. I sent her a simple message and a picture on her Facebook. We went to dinner. I wore the blue dress that Catherine so much likes.

I know I dreamt something. I told Catherine it was weird. I remember living through it and thinking how it was an amazing story. It is coming back to me. Maybe I write a little about it after remembering this day.

In the morning I made myself breakfast to take the pills. I ran out of spiro. Yesterday the results showed how my T levels are even lower than two months ago. They are just in the middle of the female range. I have no idea how the estrogen is affecting me or what the levels are. There is no alarm on the liver enzimes and my sugar is now at normal levels. On the other hand, the cholesterol is at a highest and the triglycerides are higher than normal, too.

He might ask me how is the exercise going and I think I'll have to tell him the truth. Should I ask about the other estrogen methods? Am I happy on the premarin? I guess I am. My mother asked me how many months I've been in the treatment. It was because of the changes. They are really fast. I am not even at four months and I am full time already.

Full time. I used to read about that and wonder how it would be. There is not a single time of the day I stop being Sofia. At home, with my friends, with my family. Now even at work. Iris, the new psychologist who works with Liliana and Gilda and Cathy and me, my new coworker has met me and is the first person who doesn't know my past. She is the first and only person to only know Sofia.

"Have you met each other?" asked us Lili. I don't remember her face but Catherine does. She said how she does remember our faces and pointed at the both of us. Had she seen me as a man before?

It doesn't matter.

I did not go to the United States as we had planned. Other day it will be. Both my mom and my dad came home and we left to the restaurant. I ordered a pita filled with meat. The waitresses did not gendered me, there was no need. My father pointed at me and did not say my name nor a pronoun as he had called Luis before. It was relieving. Maybe I am ready to the wedding after all.

Luis took pictures of all of us. My mom and my grandma took other ones with me at the fountain. My mom has one with just me. That is the one I like the most. She told me how Lydia, the mother of the twins, called her this morning to congratulate her and said how she was very proud of me, she admired me so much. She congratulated her as well for having a wonderful daughter.

I am her daughter. This is... new.

This is my life, this is how it feels to be alive. It is amazing.

Tomorrow Catherine will pick me up. I'll accompany her to her blood tests and she'll drive me to the endocrinologist. Today the secretary of the dr called me in the morning and asked me if he could see me earlier.

Before of that were the dreams. The first one I remember, I was walking out of school. I was not me, I was a grade school girl. At first I thought I was invisible, but no, I just had no parents... I saw the different ones as if I could choose who would take me. My body was one of a child but my mind was calculating and with a purpose. I found a woman who was perfect. Did I have to convince her to take me? I remember I she was getting on her car and I threw a rock to her windshield. She got of it and came looking. Behind her were a police car that got out and ran over her.

"This will do..." I thought moving over my next target. It was a grown man in a pick up. I talked to him and said something. I convinced him in a way. I got up and he drove. There were car wreckages all alongside the road. He ran over several people as well. What had I done? There were some kind of point system? Was he doing it on purpose? Was I in danger?

The dream changed in a way and we got out in this kind of building. Were we in a test? This was some kind of prototype of a game?

I sat besides a baby. He told me how he had seen love, real love. He felt the warmth of her caring smile caressing all his body. His life was because of her. He could not speak, he was a baby. How did I understand him? I looked at the tag in his head and is said something horrifying. What I thought was motherly love, wasn't. He was the father. Someone used his seed to make a new baby. He was to be disposed now. As if they farmed his dna. He was a disposable genetic material for procreation.

I thought something, and the woman who passed me by turned towards me and said: excuse me?

Did she hear me?

The next dream was different. It was an office, maybe in the same building. There was a line of cubicles with computers and a person to fill it and every spot. There was a problem with the network. When they finally resolved it, the doors locked and they all died. Was it poisoned gas or electroshocks from the terminals? Who was I?

What was I doing in there?

## 2016-08-19

Let's do this.

I have 53 minutes left until midnight. I was lying in bed just moments ago besides my mother. We talked about everything. The first times I left the house with woman's clothes, how I felt, the meaning behind my name and April as my proto-name, to her conversation with her coworkers and the reactions of the family.

 I went to the doctor today. Catherine picked me up a little before my mother left the house. I showered after my dad. Just my mother saw me with the tunic and the red leggings combining with the red shade of my lips. She told me how she was meaning to post the pictures on her Facebook, she even asked my dad. "As you wish", he said.

"And yesterday that we were in the dinner, I saw him and he was inhibited but not fully uncomfortable. He wasn't overly aware of his surroundings or extra attentive to other's people sights or faces. He felt the presence of other woman. Now it's not just me."

In the morning when she talked about the pictures she continued about her hesitation. She doesn't care that her coworkers know about this or their reaction. It was that this is not the way for my godmother to know and see me. She told me how she thought about going to her and telling her. Share this, in person.

Catherine arrived and we left. The first stop was the health clinic were she dropped her stool samples and we waited until they drew her blood. In the waiting room there was a woman with a baby. He smiled and looked at me and I returned the playful gesture. When we left she was seating in the driver's seat of the van besides us. She smiled as we exchanged looks. Did she notice? Did she clock me?

Catherine drove me to the meeting with the endocrinologist. We were just in time. The guard welcomed us as ladies and I signed the sheet. This time there were no credentials. Upped the stairs we got in the waiting room. The receptionist was a different woman who doesn't know me. I had to say how I had an appointment and declare my name. As time passes it does get easier.

Inside with the dr he asked me how I've been. Since when did we see us? Two months, and did I have my blood drawn? Yeah. He asked about my mammary glands, my breasts. How are they? I mentioned the sensitivity and aches. He asked for the volume. Yeah, it has changed, too. Headaches? Taquicardia? Leg pains?

He checked my weight, and my reflexes and blood pressure and my blood levels and touched my liver and appendix and all those internal stuff.

The T levels diminished even more. Everything is fine and well. He congratulated me on those numbers and hoped for everything to continue perfectly. The next meeting will be in four months. I'll continue with the same regimen.

From there we walked to the car and she drove me to the pharmacy. I used the lower discount card so I would not have issues with the other one with Ivan's name and picture. I bought the asepxia tissues and gel for Luis. I asked only for the spiro pills.

We ate breakfast in the place we usually eat breakfast. The waiter referred to us as ladies. Everything went well.

Catherine said there was this place she wanted to visit where they have all this kinds of clothes and dresses. We got inside and I felt unease with the different clothes. I could not differentiate from the good and the bad ones. I felt ignorant.

Lastly we went to the university. I saw Cabrales and Viloria. Neither of them added me to the new profile. Did they recognize me? I know Yadira did. She asked us how we were. We got both letters and there was no problem with my name. I didn't even had to say it out-loud.

My mom came home late at night, she went with her friends for a drink, was it because of me? She came to my room and lied besides me. The conversation started because of that. My godmother took it well. There was a reaction in her face and confusion but mostly acceptance. She was offended when my mother mentioned the possibility of her rejection.

They knew about me. The teacher who sees my mother as a mother figure saw my post on her profile congratulating her on her birthday. I said "mom", and she got jealous. Who was this lost daughter? She stalked my profile and saw the pictures. Again I looked a lot to Ivan. The similarities were astounding. She got to the manifesto. She read it and found the cause of my mom's recent distress. This is the change she was talking about.

Some of them knew.

The conversation was how she had it in her for so long, why did Miguel not say something before, how my father is coming to terms with it. Having patience. Accepting, supporting.

There are more and more mother and daughter conversations lately. Is this how it feels to have a real connection with your family? Is this how support feels like?

## 2016-08-20

I took my mother's advice. I'm home, already changed and I'm wearing a different set of sandals and other shorts that are not Ivan's. Even though I am in pajamas now, I still have the bra on. The shirt that I took from Catherine is what I have on top. We did go to the United States. I did not ask to Ross nor mentioned the wedding.

Yesterday I had asked and they confirmed it. I put the alarm to wake me up early enough. Were we going to go or not, I oughted to get up in the morning. Liliana canceled yesterday our meeting to give us the manuals and formats. As I got up Luis was already in the living room, changed and watching tv. It was 7 in the morning. Later would he tell me that he got up before 6. The whole day he was struggling to stay awake.

I showered and changed. I wore the red blouse and gray jeggings. I put on my makeup and thought I looked fine. This would be another day with my family. Other time I would cross the border en femme. Time passed and everything got into place. We left the house at 10 in the morning. We would all go to the office for me to get the papers and from there would we go. In the excess time we had before hand, we stopped in the bank. My mother stayed waiting and my dad drove me to the office. I waited just a couple of minutes in her waiting room. I looked at myself in the mirror across the couch. The text I sent her stayed unseen when we met. She greeted me complimenting me on my looks. "Good morning, my pretty girl". Later, inside the conversation she reinforced her own compliment confirming that I do look really beautiful. I thanked her and smiled while I had the papers in my arms.

We picked up my mom and crossed the border. The first place we stopped was the currency exchange booth. My dad took off and my mother gave Luis a 500 bill, then another one to me and finally, the last one to Luis. He went to exchange it.

We ate breakfast in the Jack in the Box. I ordered a different item from the menu. The buttery I don't know what jack or burger. It was fine.

We went to Target. I got separated from them and directed myself to the ladies section. It feels surreal to look for clothes there normally. Exploring the area without worry, putting blouses against my body not caring who is beside me or looking, when would I imagine I'd do it without a second thought? I bought two blouses and a blue tank top. I did not try any of them until home, they all fit fine. The blue one is a little tight. Miguel got lost and my mother stayed in the cafeteria. Miguel got out of the dressing room. While they were in line to the cashier I looked for shorts to be around the house. I keep thinking the words my mom told me. They see me in Ivan's clothes. They see him when I'm wearing them. I don't want that. I wish I could have what Catherine described that other day: "I would still wear the clothes until they don't fit me anymore, until my body doesn't match them. I would want to see the mismatch between us, and see me outgrown them."

I looked in the sales area and got between two girls chatting. They were commenting the clothes and exchanging exclamations and observations. Did they see me, notice me? When I let the one behind me pass, she excused herself. Would they talk about that person in that area? Was that a girl or a boy?

Yesterday in the school, when we were waiting for the letter from the principal office, I thought I heard one the three med students ask, "is that a girl? a young man?" I paid no attention and let the words go. I wasn't sure, and even if they were mustered, I would not know their meaning.

I found the shorts and chose two. I'll wear them in Mexicali with Catherine. The day after tomorrow we'll leave the city. We'll be together for a week. From monday until friday, like we used to be in school. Except we'll share the nights as well. It's amazing specially because of the nights and the mornings.

## 2016-08-21

The baggage is almost ready. The clothes and underwear and towel and shoes are all in there. In the box that Luis gave me I put under lock the condoms, the bottle of lubricant and the vibrator. It's almost full. The bag with toiletries is the only thing that's left to put. Just now as I turn towards my bed, the thought of not going to sleep here after today for a week hit me. Will I take the pillow with me? Will it fit?

I am excited. As much excited that I don't even care about the name or the situation. Will I say Sofia when they ask ours for the ticket? I don't know, maybe. The only thing that matters is that I'll be with Catherine for the week. My father will take both my brothers to school tomorrow. My mom, anyway, will leave early, she has to arrange and set her classroom. I think I will get to the bus station in an uber. It will be the first time that I ask and take one for myself. It will appear Sofia in there.

I went and asked my mother for glue. After pasting the cover and back cover back to the notebook I planned to take, I have decided that I'll take the red moleskine instead. I keep thinking, trying to decide if I take or not my purse. I feel a thousand times more comfortable with it than with the gray backpack.

Why? It's not specifically male. Catherine likes it. I don't know.

I keep getting myself distracted instead of finishing this and getting to sleep. Tomorrow I have to wake up early so I finish setting everything up and leaving with time. I am nervous.

Tomorrow will be the start of a new week. Luis will go to school, my mom will start with classes. I will leave the city for a week. This will be the longest I'll sleep with Catherine. We will buy the groceries together and prepare our own food.

I think about the uber to the bus station, the morning routine and race with time. I think about saying or not my name to the clerk of the bus and getting to my grandma's and what will happen in the school there. I haven't given a thought about Edgar's reaction. What does he expect? He took it alright according to my mother and grandma... but, I think I fear the accepting ones even more. They tend to take it lightly and playfully. It's way more comfortable the awkward silence of tense people, their try of pretending that nothing has changed.

This morning my godmother sent me a friend. I accepted without a second thought. Yesterday my mother had said how she told her she pretended to talk with me. Maybe that was it. She commented on my profile with greetings and good wishes and the support of all her family. She called me goddaughter and it felt nice. Again, I was sure that was it.

I got up from bed and looked out to see all of the cars. I opened the fridge with the intention to heat my one week old biscuit. I was just about to set the time when I decided against it. It went to the thrash. Moments later my dad got in with bags from the convenience store and the paper bag with the characteristic yellow star.

I ate my food and went to the bathroom. Exiting my mother called me and said my godmother just asked her if she could call me. I was entering the bathroom so she told her I was eating. I was free now, wasn't I? Sure. I was petrified on the inside. The mismatch between they knowing and my voice discomforts me. What do they expect to hear Ivan? They know how I look now, how do they think I sound? How do I sound?

The conversation or what she had to say to me was something secondary. I brought the clothes from the drying machine and was folding them when the phone rang. I answered anxiously but surely. She said good morning with a joyous candace in her voice. How was I, fine, how was her. She asked to call because maybe we all had an occupied night yesterday and you never know... Yeah, I know...

Then she said: "And how is the planning going?" Wait, what? Oh. She thought I was my mother...

"uh, I am not Laura". She laughed nervously, surprised and shock. I could hear through the phone how everything made sense. Yeah, I am not a man now, has my voice changed that much? Wow.

It's not the first time I've been mistaken as my mother. Why did this feel different? Why was this so reassuring and comforting?

## 2016-08-22

I waited for you under the rain two hours, a thousand hours, like a dog. When you arrived, you looked at me and told me "Crazy, I don't love you anymore".

The first time I heard that song I was in high school with Mariana. It was my first concert. Everything ... I lost track of that thought. It doesn't matter. I'm sitting with Catherine by my side eating Edgar's food. We are in Mexicali.

I woke up this morning early. I got up from bed just as my dad and brothers were leaving home. It was just a couple of minutes after six. I got in the shower and started the routine. My mother was supposed to be leaving home by that time but she was not awaken by her alarm.

The luggage was all set and ready. I talked with Catherine just as she woke up. The morning past and the free time I had I used to eat breakfast and watched the first half of the Spider-man movie.

Catherine would be taken to bus station by her mother. My mother had left already so I was just alone. I had decided to take an uber. I called for it minutes before nine.

I left the house with my red blouse and denim shorts. My lips were red and my lashes full. One man was walking with thrash bags to the container. He passed me by and greeted me without gendering me. The uber approached and I waved to him. I got in after putting my luggage. He said something to me but I did not understand.

"Would you come to the front seat? The taxi drivers at the bus station might get a little aggressive." Sure, of course.

The drive went calm and silent. The voice from the radio station was talking about Trump and his searching for the latino vote.

"Do you believe him?" I just laughed and told him no.

He left me there and I waited for a little while. I was early. The time we accorded to was 9:20. There were some people with their baggage waiting there. One of them looked at me, he was a young boy. I caught three pokemon. I had my aunt's number in a pink piece of paper. I was nervous with the idea of calling her. How would I introduce myself? What voice should I use?

"My own" and the answer seems so obvious, and yet I doubted it. Which one is mine? Do I need to fake my voice? Is the natural one not mine?

Catherine asked me to see the timetables. The next buses would go out at 10:30, an hour after she would arrive. When she came, I went out the help her out of the car. Her mother saw me before her. She asked the woman behind the counter of Aguacalientes' Buses. She informed us the next one would leave in five minutes. She asked us if we were students. Catherine answered with the truth.

She asked for our names, Catherine went first. She looked at me, but Catherine's voice was faster. "Sofia Fernandez". It was done. Later would she notice how she gave us two of the six seats reserved for women.

I sent a text message to my mother and Catherine to hers. I typed the message to my aunt. I preferred that to calling her. Maybe that wasn't the correct choice.

We both fell asleep on our way here. I first and then she reclined her head to take her turn. When we woke up we kissed as we hadn't in a long, long time. Neither of us gave a thought to the people who could see us.

Leaving the Rumorosa, as the first moment I got signal, I called my aunt. "Hi, Aunt Cruz, I am Sofia, the daughter of Laura..." I told her how we were on our way. She was waiting already at the bus station. For a moment it felt awkward, was she annoyed?

She brought us home, and my grandma welcomed us. We walked towards the school and look for refuge from the heat in the cafeteria. She ordered a sandwich and I a yakimeshi. It was weirder than the last time I was in the university, even though here nobody knows me. I was in a classroom, paying attention, surrounded by people.

"I'm just waiting for the two people who would come from Tijuana" Javier asked. He was talking about us.

"Which one is Catherine? And you?"

"Sofia"



## 2016-08-23

This was the second day of the course. We're home now. The door was open, Edgar was waiting for us.

Yesterday we had sex. After returning from the class, Edgar was already here. I introduced Catherine to him and he cooked his chicken for today. He had said to my grandma how he wanted to talk to his "little sister", I'd be lying if I say that I was not nervous or even a little afraid of what he could had wanted to say to me. He made no mention of the elephant in the room. He treated just as he always has. It was the little things as he referred to the feminine plural to us, or called us "Sofia, Catherine, the chicken is ready if you want to eat".

The only kind of mention was a subtle question with a look: "how is everyone back home?"

He said he would be leaving to change a tire, he'd be back soon. Catherine and I went to bed and fooled around. I teased her a little and she wanted to go further. Edgar would be back at any moment and the danger of being caught was exhilarating.

I made no mention of the fucking we did in yesterday's words. I don't remember if we took all of our clothes off. We touched each other. We took out a condom and tried to put it on my member. The cum was minimal but the orgasm dumbfounding. It was globally and way more intense than other times. I felt an explosion from the tip of my genitals irradiating to my whole body, a pulsating wave of pleasure.

We went to sleep. We woke up in the middle of the night and continued. "What time is it?" "3 in the morning", she answered back in a whisper. "Oh, that's why I'm barely awake".

The session continued a couple hours later after falling and coming back to sleep. This time I made her come. We would get up later in the morning and continued where we left off. This time I made her come again. We showered and dressed. We went to the market and bought groceries for the rest of the week.

I made her breakfast and she cooked lunch. We ate eggs with a salsa of fresh tomatoes and she prepared tuna with a can of mixed vegetables.

We watched the first episode of Stranger Things in Netflix. After it finished we walked to school. The plan was born on our way there. Maybe we could order an uber to take us to Hookahfe, the cafe with Hookahs, after class. I sent Edgar a text message telling him we would be late and not to worry about us.

The class finished 20 minutes after time it should had ended. Today the class was about the history of Neuropsychology, its general terms and basic syndromes. Again it was mostly information that we already now, although the review was pretty useful. The new terms were few but was the whole worth of today's class.

After walking out, I ordered the uber and raced it to the meeting point. Catherine sat in the front row and again was asked if she was Sofia. I wonder sometimes how people really see me. In the class, do they see me as one of the girls who came from Tijuana, or am I the weird androgynous person who might be a transvestite man or an unfortunately woman.

Maybe they don't notice me at all.

No, I am not invisible.

The uber took us to the cafe and we entered, the waitress asked us if we were ready in the feminine, and gendered us that way the whole time. She was nice and attentive. Did I mishear when she told the couple in front of us she would take their tea pitcher "for them [masculine]"? Probably, the only difference is a vowel, and even then it would be the general neutral way. I did not focused on that like other days.

We smoked a hookah with mixed shisha of coffee and vanilla, and the base was filled with milk. Catherine ordered a hot dog with chilli.

We decided to go eat dinner. In the university she was starving. We walked around and went to a grill and ordered three tacos each. They were tasty. The waiters again called us girls. The last one even made a comment of how he could set the bill in the middle as we were both woman.

"How do you feel with being out?", she asked me once while we ate. I forget about it, and that's the best thing of all. I can just forget that I have something to worry about. I, finally, just enjoy being me while being with her.

## 2016-08-24

I'm sitting at the table right now. Catherine is eating her instant soup and we both have a glass of beer with clam juice.

We woke up again, this time I got up from a dream and went to the bathroom. In the dream I juggled different appointments and struggle to remember which was with whom and when. I was outside of a psych consultation room, I was waiting for my therapist. Yolanda came out and gave me a present.

I woke up and went to the bathroom. When I returned to bed I saw how Catherine noted my absence and hugged me from behind as I accompanied her under the sheets.

Later in the morning we started fooling around with our hands and the vibrators. We were both naked and moaning and I had the blue toy between her legs, she was closed to coming when suddenly asked me to stop.

We made breakfast, this time it was her turn. She prepared ham and eggs. We sided them with the white rice Edgar had made Monday. We showered and got ready. We had the plans of going to the Mall downtown. We might look around for a dress or a wallet. I wore the white dress. I applied a little make up and thought I looked fine. I didn't even care much about the razor machine. I just passed it once without glasses before entering the shower.

I ordered the uber and he picked us up from the front door. He left us there and the first store we visited was Sears. We looked around and firstly saw a blue dress, crossed in the front, elegant and formal. The price was high but razonable. I thought about buying, I could take it with me to a fitting room. We continued looking around and got to the area of dresses. After browsing them, we decided to pick three different ones. One black, and two blue.

We entered together to the fitting room and the first one I tried was the long one, Catherine had picked it. She helped me putting it over my head and shoulders and zipping it up. I looked fine.

Just now I'm returning from the bathroom, it's the fourth time today that I go and sit and try to evacuate. It's fruitless. Just gas and clear water. I feel my stomach bloated. I feel fat and a little ugly. Maybe that's why I wondered after exiting the store how people saw me. I walked around the whole day in a white dress, but did people really see a young woman? I saw no judging sights nor doubting faces. There were no strange comments and the people who gendered me all did it correctly. It was all in my head.

"I got a little sad after the boutiques" "You got saddened by yourself"... "That's what I said"

We were wandering about the mall, looking for different boutiques were we could find other dresses. Each one was another hit to my self-image. The number of items were fewer and from the ones they did have, just a fraction were even a size possible of fitting me. From the three dresses that we brought, just one fit. Another didn't close and the third one I couldn't even pass my head through the neck hole. My bigger head than normal, my non-female gigantic head.

The first boutique we got into, the seller saw us enter. Catherine asked her for dresses in the bigger sizes. She showed us the few she had and made the comment of how the rest of the bigger ones were not in a young style but the ones older women would wear.

She later tried to make more nice comments or helping suggestions, but by them I just wanted to get out.

As my mood continued to get worse, I thought Catherine had gotten a little sick of me. I asked her what she wanted to do and she answered back with a question: "Do you want to go home?" I saw a glimpse of disappointed doubt, but ended confirming it. We got back home and I prepared the pasta.

In my urge of getting it all right, of returning the favor of cooking this time, I almost-ruined everything. I had to change clothes to avoid spilling my dress. We ate the pasta and the leftovers from Edgar's chicken.

In the class, there was a girl who started a conversation with me, then other guy came and asked if we were the ones that really came from Tijuana. Do we come and go everyday? Were are we staying? The girl looked a lot like Andrea. Catherine would later pass me a note with the same message.

The master asked a question and as I whispered the answer to Catherine, he heard the right one from our side. He gendered me female, too. "She said it first"

Later, making a comment of how us, the girls from Tijuana were beating them, asked us for the topographical diagnosis of a Wernicke's Aphasia. He didn't expect us to answer.

And yet I said:

"The third posterior area of the superior... temporal gyrus?"

"Give the points to her"

I was happier to hear the her, than the appreciation to my correct answer.

## 2016-08-25

We laughed in bed, we laughed out loud, those times when you can't stop, and your stomach hurts and you even cry a little. We were trying of thinking of names for a pet. I said that I had thought about Luria, the last name of the father of modern neuropsychology. I remember about Paulino, one of my classmates in Salamanca, he has a cat. His name is either Freud or Sigmund. I think it's Freud. I could name my dog Luria. We tried to recall the series and books we like. Game of thrones? What about Khalessi... No, I'd prefer Daenerys. Hodor?

Series, like Daredevil, maybe foggy. Or Luke and Killergrave from Jessica Jones. Maybe Sherlock, she liked it but I didn't.

The motive of our laughs was that we thought about Luria, Alexandra might offend Paola. So, maybe a part of the brain? Which are the cool named ones? Hippocampus? Nah, Broca, or Wernicke, maybe... We named the meninges, pia madre, dura madre... that other part named putamen. We started laughing. I tried to say them out loud but said instead Puta madre, mixing both of them. She even cried a little.

Why were we thinking of names of pets?

Yesterday my aunt called in the afternoon to invite us to eat lunch at her house. We were just finishing the pasta I made. I felt a little bad turning her off, but accepted her offer to postpone. Even today we had in mind she might call us again to confirm.

We were in bed watching Stranger things when I heard the fence tingle. She knocked into the window and I opened her the door. She said she came for us to pick us up, she might take us to school. Had we eaten? We told her the truth so she said we could go to her house to eat and then she take us to the university.

Catherine put her shoes and we left. I was wearing the black blouse with the white vest. Underneath I had the burgundy jeans. She is wearing shorts and a white t-shirt of the beatles. We are both at the table right now, with a glass each of beer and clam juice.

When we got to her house I hoped nobody were home. I worried a little too, about what were we going to eat. Getting in I heard the cries of little animals. She has two little puppies. They were so small they could even fit in my shoe. They were white little balls of fur with four legs to crawl on the floor. We sat at the table for her to finish slicing the lettuce. I felt tiny nails scratching my feet and look down to find one trying to climb my foot. She used her tiny paws to get on my leg. Catherine said she was trying to find the warmth of her mother.

I envy sometimes Catherine and her relationship with her dog. I wish I could had or have something of the like. I've had dogs before. The first one was Sparky. And he was actually mine. But he never acknowledged me. He was mine, but I never were his. He wouldn't had recognized me. I was afraid of him until they took him away and died. The second one was Max, he was a white pitbull but his stay was short and we never really got to know each other. I was still afraid of him. The first one was given to us by my godmother and Jessica, the second by the Tae Kwon Do teacher. My grandmother took him to Mexicali and then gave him to someone else, he died too, a little after.

The last dog that lived with us was Stitch. I wasn't afraid of him. But never really tried to bond either. He wasn't mine, I didn't want him. Was I scared of him dying? Was I trying to avoid not getting to know him, too? That he, even after all that time would never recognize me either.

I have never liked feeling invisible.

So this time I was hesitant to even acknowledge the want of staying with the little puppy on my feet. I wanted her to come home with me, to sleep by my room and give me the chance to take care of her. I like the idea of being the carer of another. Having some one more fragile than me, more needing of care. Feeling useful and accompanied. Needed and loved.

Maybe I will ask my aunt to the chance of staying with her and name her.

## 2016-08-26

We are home once again. This is the last night we're going to sleep together in my grandma's bed. This is the end of our short practice as living partners. I try to recall the many things we did and visited and I can't help to smile. She is right behind me snooping like many of the last nights. I don't mind her eyes. I don't have to worry about her judging me.

We saw the last chapter of Stranger Things last night. We started the series as we got here. My aunt brought us from the bus station and my grandma welcomed us. Tomorrow, the same aunt will drive us there and my grandma will expect me home.

This morning Catherine woke me. This was the latest I've gotten up since we got here. I dreamed something but can't remember it. Catherine had the breakfast ready. She cooked the potatoes with the chorizo we bought, she prepared it just for us. This morning I went to the bathroom and finally stop leaking clear water.

I asked Catherine for her help to decide the clothes I'd wear. She picked the long-tailed blouse. So, if my aunt would pick us up again, she'd see me femininely. We were lying in bed doing or talking I don't remember what. When we started kissing and touching each other. The heat of the moment embraced us and did what nature expected from us. I kissed her lips and neck, she touched my breasts and nibbled my nipples. I went down her chest, her stomach, I bit her underwear and kissed under it. We both knew what was coming next. I pushed my lips trough the cloth of her panties. Her lubricant's taste surrounded my mouth. I caressed her clitoris with the point of my tongue, moved it around trying to control her moans.

Today I asked her to penetrate me. I wanted her inside of me. I love the feeling of being dominated, owned by her, being totally under her control.

We fooled around on the bed, switching who was with her eyes closed and her legs opened. Finally, as we were both to coming, she proposed having our clitorises together. We came at the same time, like those memories I cherish.

We showered together. This time it wasn't passionate or even erotic. It was functional, practical. More than anything it was intimate.

We ate as practical as we got ready. I made a sandwich, fresh with mayo and ham, slices of tomato and cucumber. She made herself with the bread toasted and hot. I sliced the rest of the cucumber and put it into two separate containers. She put the sauces and the clamato juice. I crushed the churritos, and put them into mine. She would wait to get to the university or the store and buy a bag of tostitos.

We were talking in bed when my phone rang and was my aunt. She said she was home and asked if we ate already for us to eat at her house. I said we had, but could go and stay a while with her if she wanted. I had thought the night before about telling her, saying something about wanting to keep one of the puppies. We even talked about names. It was becoming more and more real. The want wasn't just a game or a fantasy anymore. It was becoming something more, a wish that could lead to disappointment and lose. It's a little scary.

The phone rang a little while later. This time it was my cousin saying he was outside. We got our things and left home. He drove us and made chit chat. He didn't seem nervous or bothered. Didn't I really have anything to worry? Is this going to be like with everybody else?

I played with the puppies and mentioned my wish to keep them. My aunt commented how it would be good to not separate them. I could keep and care one, but two of them?

My aunt served us some of the food she made anyway. We ate it and spent the hour before school with them. Valeria came and saw us. How does she see me? She never really knew me before. She had met me, but... how is it for her? I never knew somebody like me.

In the university we had the last session. Javier made the mention and honored us for coming from Tijuana. We stayed a while with him afterwards.

We went to Hookahfe again, this time we ordered a hookah flavored with grape and the base was of red wine.

The uber home kept referring us as girls. Even after me talking, he called us girls.

Do I pass? Can I be comfortable now presenting outside, going to the restroom?

Can I keep my guard down and let myself be? What more do I need?


## 2016-08-27

I'm home and yet I feel homesick. The feeling that cursed me when I returned from Spain, that unfamiliarity and strangeness that stank the bed that was supposed to welcome me. I see the bed all made and clean, waiting for me to rest in it, my comfortable pillows and used-to mattress. I thought I would miss it. I miss Catherine now.

I was seeing the pictures of this last week. Our smiles and playful faces, the videos of us preparing and cooking breakfast. I love us even more seeing the cheerful faces with unkept hair and night clothes. I love the feeling of the hotness of her body warming me under the fresh sheet. I'll miss the ability to reach her waking up in the night. Feeling missed and welcomed as I return from the bathroom.

This was supposed to be a try or mock-up of what we could expect living together. Doing the grocery shopping and exchanging turns of doing the dishes and cooking. How underestimated is the pleasure of asking someone to come to bed with you.

Just now I feel my throat hugging itself and my eyes watering. Is the homesickness and nostalgia of the week or the coming back of the consciousness of the condition I'm in here?

We had to get up early in the morning to get ready for when my aunt would pick us up. The alarm started its song at 7 in the morning. I asked her to postponed it and she agreed. I appreciated every extra minute as a treasure. We showered and got ready. Our baggage was set and done. We had talked about going to taste the pig meat tacos. Edgar showered after me. He asked me when would we like to leave, he could give us a ride. I told him not to worry, my aunt already proposed to take us. We would leave in a couple of hours. He said he'd go to the gym then. He said his good-bye. I extended my hand but he denied it. He reached for a hug and I reciprocated it awkwardly. He was really nice, the whole week. He treated me normally, made no comments or showing of discomfort. He used my name, he called us in the feminine. He met Catherine. It all went well, amazingly good. His good-bye was a small scaled remembrance of the period of departures in my time in Spain. The painful signal that the magical bubble period where everything is fantastic was just about to burst.

We walked and order our tacos. Each one of us ordered two. After finishing we made a stop at the place crossing the street. We ate one taco each of birria. The name of the place was Salamanca's tacos.

My aunt came for us and drove us to the station. Our father's picked us up. He made some chit chat. For a little while I ignored the minutes old nervousness of him seeing me with a blouse that shows the contours of my breasts. He asked me how the trip was, how the course went. I talked back and everything felt normal, just like the passed days. My expectations did not come. There is nothing wrong with me, nothing abnormal. I can forget being trans. I'm just me.

He asked me to tell my mom that he had picked me up already, and asked her if she wanted us to come get her. I hesitated at writing the message. Should I had written it from his perspective, would writing Sofia be exceptional to the point of surprise? Would I be able to type Ivan? The feeling came, I remembered again the difficulty of living here, where my past haunts me.

I asked to go to Costco. I've been running out of pills. My mother and father took me. For once I remembered the feeling of being an only child. We met my godmother there. I separated myself and when I turned I saw them saying hi to somebody. I returned and greeted them. She called me "mija", and said how seeing me she wondered "Is that really her?". It was validating, another nod to this successful trip. Even Jose, her son, said nothing, either with his mouth or eyes.

Getting to the line, my mother asked me to exchange an item. I went and returned. I can't remember why I separated again. This time I got lost.

I looked for them, I felt disoriented. When I found them my dad was waving at me. I was far away not to hear them, but close enough to see his lips crearly. My mother turned to him and he made a face of explanation, his lips read "perdido".

I recognized the circling of the mouth that telegraphs the final and masculine O. My mother lift a finger and looked at him with correcting eyes. Her lips were as clear as his and danced just like his, as well, almost the same movements. All but the last one: a final opened aperture marking an ending feminine a. "Perdida". There was an emphasis in that ending.

Weeks ago she was changing the way she referred to me and now she was correcting him.

Why did I feel sick? Why did I wanted the earth to swallow me whole and return me to Mexicali or somewhere else where I would freely forget about my incongruence?

I went and returned from Aidee's. I met her son. At first he was peacefully asleep on his grandparents bed. I sat in front of the mirror and paid attention to what she explained to me.

Yesterday I put the alarm even though I was not going to need to wake up early. I spent the night enjoying my bed, it was hard getting up from bed. I slept most of the night and was as restless as my return in the bus. I postponed the alarm various times. I can't remember the dreams that distracted me from waking up.

My father had just returned from buying breakfast.

Luis is here behind my back.

I took my pills and went to the shower. I hesitated looking for clothes to wear. What could I choose? Should I go feminine or ambiguos? Catherine yesterday told me to wear the white blouse with the jeans I was wearing or the burgundy ones. Both of them are dirty. I took the white blouse and the first pair of jeans she lend me. After showering I put on the gray jeggings and took a blue blouse from the closet. I changed from it, to a green one, then the red one from Guadalajara and finally returned to the first outfit.

Writing this feels tiring. I feel exhausted and look at my bed with desire of closing my eyes and resting.

Why am I avoiding talking about the make up session? I started narrating it. I talked about Aidee and her son, I was sitting in her parent's bedroom waiting for her to bring her things.

She helped me, she explained the uses and types of brushes. She put primer on my face and then foundation in half of my face. The lesson was a little weird. I didn't feel once that I was putting on a disguise or having a make over. I always felt like a woman learning a necessary skill. She never misgendered me once. Even when her sister came she always talked about me in the feminine.

It felt validating, amazing. After the make up, she did my hair. She undid the curls and moved the hairline more to the left.

We went downstairs and continued talking about how I've been, how my parents have taken it, my brothers and family. We talked about Monica. She asked first if she knew about me and I took the chance to say what I've been meaning to take out. I told her about everything. How she broke up with me, how we separated and returned over and over, how in august she saw me for fifteen minutes after nine months of not seeing each other, how in October she told me she was not ready to be my friend and selfishly made this difficult phase and episode of my life about her, how later this year I talked to her and her first response was to ask me if I still doubted I had hurt her, how she told me how no matter what I am, it doesn't change the fact I behaved like an asshole towards her.

"I don't know how you kept talking to her... Did you never see her like that, how she really was?"

Valeria and Omar and all of them excluded her from the group, too. I did know, but did not remember at the time, how she had been with Rupit. They were together for a while in high school. They broke up and she had some meetups with Omar. Did I know that? Maybe, there was something of the like, I think. I had distanced myself from them by then.

Something happened between both of them, she told me... "What do you mean between both of them?"

Omar and Rupit liked each other. Omar told us how he was confused. Maybe he was obsessed with our relationship because he was jealous. He wanted Rupit more than he wanted me.

They talked about it, Rupit felt something similar towards Omar. They got together once and talked about it just the two of them... Did they did something? Surely they kissed at least. I put myself in that place, alone with someone whom I like and feel something towards, knowing that they feel something similar in the same way. I don't see how we would not kiss each other.

Well, I was alone with Monica for months before any of us dared to kiss.

I took a picture and sent it to Catherine, the end result. I told Aidee how I liked it, and I wasn't really lying. It was different, I saw myself new... I didn;t really know hoe I looked.

Tomorrow I'll see her. Maybe I'll buy something.

## 2016-08-29

Finally the day arrived when I could go to the United States, several times we had to cancel and postpone it. This week is the graduation. I woke up early in the morning. Not by four like I had considered, but near 6. I'd be leaving home with my mother, after 8 I'd take the bus to the border and cross to meet Catherine at her school. I got up and showered. I even shaved a little with the razor and brush. In the late night I felt discomfort in my sleep. This concern about turning, this uneasiness in my stomach. I worried while in the shower. I got out of it and stood in front of the toilet. I finally threw up. A brown sugary mixture of donuts and milk and meatballs splashed the water. An electrical tingle crawled through my arms. My legs felt weak and broken, the strong nauseous smell scratched my nostrils. The half digested food came again. I flushed the muddy water and returned to the shower.

I came down stairs and sent a message to Catherine telling her I had thrown up, but I felt better now. I had several of hers telling me she was ready but had thrown up... "Sofia, I threw up again". Yesterday she told me in messages by midnight how she couldn't fall asleep. Her tummy was hard and swollen. I asked her disappointed if she wanted to cancel. I felt frustrated and upset. Once again would we postpone it. She felt really bad, she had diarrhea, she didn't want to drive feeling this way. Maybe later could we go? She'd pick me up.

I felt the nausea again, coming from within, crawling through my viscera with its long and bony fingers. I went with my mother and told her I had thrown up and would not go. I returned to bed and lied down to sleep. The morning I spent in a conflicted slumber. I tossed and torn with the nausea pushing my insides with every change of position. I felt the acidness of the gastric juices burning my throat. I wanted to vomit again and the mere thought of it made me sicker.

At first I was disappointed with Catherine's decision to cancel. Even though she proposed to see how we went along the morning, I couldn't had gone. The whole morning passed under my sheets in sweat and nightmares. I got up after two. Cande had made me chicken and rice. I was not hungry. I didn't want to take the pills because of the fear of throwing them up with the breakfast. I cut one of the chickens in half and served it with a generous spoonful of white steamed rice. One mouthful of the spicy animal was enough to realize it was a bad idea. I returned it to the pan and scrambled two eggs with three cherry tomatoes. Maybe the freshness of it would be a better option.

I finished and ate it with the rice. The last spoons were hard to swallow. I forced myself to finish leaving more than half the fresh fruits. I lied in the couch and watched something. Was it a movie or was it a series? I think it was the unfinished episode of The strain I did not completed yesterday.

I returned to bed and answered the messages to Catherine and Anahi. Would I be healthier tomorrow to redo the plans? Wednesday we will meet with Anahi after my therapy. Thursday is the graduation of jhonny and Saturday it's the party.

The days keep passing by, it seems as if it was planned on purpose. The day will come and I won't have the clothes nor shoes to wear.

I slept again with the stomach sensitive and fragile. My mom and brother came, little after my dad and Miguel got in, too.

Should I had gone to the doctor? I was scared. I feared the reaction or way of treating me I would face. Either I'd go with Hector, the doctor who knows me and has treated me almost all of my life, or I would avoid him and decide to go to a fresh out of school youngun in the clinics attached to the pharmacies. What name would I give? Would they respect it? How would I look with the gloomy cloud of sickness over me.

I trembled and cried in bed. After my mom and dad left somewhere I asked my grandma to cook me a soup and it calmed the rest of the symptoms that the paracetamol did not tame.

I am still a little scared. About the doctor, about the week and the clothes and the rush, about throwing up again and feel the weakness crush me to bed once again.

## 2016-08-30

I know Xennia since we were both 4 years old. I learn to write and read with her. I think I remember that she was the first girl I kiss. I innocently walked towards her and planted a childish kiss on her cheek. She wiped her face and nothing happened. Today she knew about me.

I went to sleep sickish and spent the night drowned in sweat. Did I have feverish nightmares? No. I didn't woke up with nausea or the urges to run to the bathroom. I woke up early, before dawn. I heard the voices of my grandma and one of my brothers. Who was it? She offered to make him something, he answered back. Luis.

I got up and drank water to cover the taste of acid in my throat. I returned to bed and went back to slumber. My grandma came later and brought me a bowl of soup, the can I found yesterday of chicken and rice. I remembered how I got up and taste it. I could see the memory, the sensations of the hot plate and the metallic spoon bringing the broth to my mouth. I turned to find the plate still steaming and unmoved.

I heard the vibrations of the phone. Catherine told me early how she would have to go today to school to be an hour in the computer lab. She'd meet a classmate there to copy the notes of the week she was absent. I heard the vibrations of a new text again. I turned to the wall and kept my eyes closed. 'Maybe it's her, she's telling me to catch up to her, we could go shopping. I should picked it up'.

I decided not to, and slept again.

An hour later I finished the soup and read the texts. She had arrived earlier than she thought. She invited me to go, then, in my silence, she reminded herself I felt bad, I could not got.

No, I had nausea again, I couldn't, could I?

We talked a little. I should try to shower anyway. I wanted to, the other option is going Thursday before the act and find something. But... I feel pressured enough, what if I don't find anything? The times we've looked I've bought short dresses. Catherine herself told me how she has find the long ones she's bought.

I showered and got ready. Catherine told me to take it easy, see how feel. I put the attire I had set up for yesterday. The red leggings and long tunic that my grandma fixed me. I did my hair lazily and put up just enough make up to look different.

My grandma asked me if I felt better and if I would go out. I told her yes. Did I honestly feel better? No, I had my doubts. The symptoms stayed I tried to ignore and deny them. I left and drove.

In the parking I waited behind just one car. He entered just moments after I stopped. Not much passed before another car left and I got his spot. I walked to the pedwest border. From the parking lot I headed to the old one and up the bridge, I crossed it to the other side, the ramp besides the river. On the way there, two or three people referred to me as miss.

There was no line. I got to the building without stopping, I decided to put the sentri away and cross normally. The patrol officer asked the usual questions and said nothing. I went to the plaza by myself, Catherine told me she would catch up with me later. I would be looking by myself first.

I got to Ross and felt the freshness of the wet spots in my back. The black sweat marks were like spots on a tiger skin. I had them on my chest and my stomach and different parts of my upper and lower back. I kept wiping sweat from my brow, cold water from a cold skin.

Was it the fever or the walk?

I looked around but did not what I was looking for. I went to the bathroom and met with Catherine later. I bought four dresses. Two long black ones, one for the graduation and another for the wedding. Catherine loved the last one. I looked pretty.

The other two are red. One for a night out and the other for the ceremony.

We came back.

Catherine met with Xennia. She knows about me. She had seen a picture of me in Facebook. It wasn't one I posted, it was the one Catherine published with me and Luis. "Is that Ivan? Who is that kid, I know him, but why does it appear another name?"

I do look different, I look fine, happier.

Her sister has a girlfriend, too.

I knew them, met them when I was just a child. When would I imagine that little girl would be a lesbian, or that I would be a girl and a lesbian.

Aren't we supposed to be abnormal?

## 2016-08-31

A year ago the talk about her parents wedding started. I remember it well, being in the car when she told me the date. "Next year by September. I'm planning on inviting everybody, you know?" The thought crossed both of our minds. Lots of time until that date, who knows what could happen. By then it wasn't the gang's graduation yet, I knew I'd be wearing a tux to that, that's why the doubt of my attendance was another theme of conversation. Maybe by march both of out parents would know, maybe I wouldn't need to be wearing a suit and tie to that. "Who knows, maybe by that time everybody knows about me, maybe I'd be already changing and I'd attend as me, can you imagine it?"

A year passed and with it, lots of the things that we thought would changed. Both graduations passed. The first one of our friends was the painful night I started on antidepressants and they were not enough to take the pain of pretending. I left by the middle of the party. We both told our moms. We both wanted to tell more people and looked for ways to find the courage. I made the appointment to the endocrinologist and our graduation came up. I wore a suit again, but this time was by my choosing. I dealt with it fine. It was the last time I'd be wearing one of those things. Did I know it then? I started hormones. I started changing, I told the rest of my family and the world. Catherine told her father. Tomorrow will be a third graduation, our first as graduates. My first return to the school with a dress. I have the dress ready for the party, the first one where I'll attend in a gown. I have the dress ready for the wedding. We are invited, she did invite all of our friends. Her family will be there, mine will be there... I'll be there.

This morning I was finally recovered. The only ill feeling I woke with was a pulsing headache as I stood on my feet. My grandma had fried potatoes and left some in a plate for me, she put apart some chorizo if I wanted to mix them up. I fried two eggs and ate it as breakfast. It was just a little more than an hour before noon. I was exhausted. I finished eating and took the pills. I've lost count of the days I've been on them. I turned at the mirror and stop looking for differences. I see my face in the reflection and don't have to worry about my hair or the hairs of my chin or the masculine attributes that I want to disappear.

I start to feel the calm I read so much about. I can rest now. I have the sandals and the dress. Aidee set the appointment to the make up and hair. Everything is done. I thought about showing my grandma and mother the pictures of me wearing the dress for the wedding. They will see me this weekend as I get ready to the grad.

Tomorrow I'll see jhonny, I might see gabriela and victor. I might see other people visiting them. Maybe Garab, Theresa? Maybe Ivan or Felix. Am I nervous? Am I nervous about seeing a teacher? Some know about me, what about the rest? Would I say hi?

I am sweating, is this heat or nervousness?

I'll wear one of the new dresses tomorrow. The clothes are all set and ready. Before picking Catherine up I'll take my grandma to buy more shakiras and pearls for her to finish the ankle bracelet for Catherine's mom. Time is passing. The wedding is just a couples away. My next endocrinologist and lab appointment will be after the publishing of the convocation for the master studies. Lots of masters and doctors I've seen this last years. They were students like me. I'm successful, I am capable. I should get it. I remembered most of the things we reviewed in the course.

Even if I don't get in, I'll look for another program in the capital. I can't stay here... No

I must not think about failing, I haven't even tried. I should get prepared. I should study.

I sent the text message to my aunt about the name of the puppy. I don't know if she received it or not. I hope she did. I hope she keeps it and we can pick it up. I hope the little dog can get to know me and I will be able to care for her.



## 2016-09-01

What happened this morning? I was going to take my grandma to the store. Yesterday I said to them how there was a crafts shop in the plaza near the 5 & 10 down the neighborhood. We could go there. Later, talking with Catherine I came to realize it wasn't here in the plaza, but in the mall near her house. I could go pick her up and take my grandma to that store. After returning home, we could stay a little until going to jhonny's.

I got up from bed. I did not need the alarm I put last night. I was awake when Luis and grandma talked over breakfast. I heard the morning chats and the sounds of their routines. I stayed in bed and continued sleeping. It was near 10 when I finally got up. This time there was no breakfast ready. I heated the biscuit from Sunday and fried and egg to exchange the one within. I took my pills and watched the fraction of the episode that was airing of Law and Order SVU. The clothes were ready. I'd be wearing the new red dress, today would be the ceremony of jhonny. He'd see me again, for a second time as sofia. This time I'd be wearing a dress. Would I encounter other classmates? Some teachers?

I showered and shaved my legs and chest and face. Everything was set and done. My grandma came to my room as I was still in pijama with the hair wet and told me that I could go by myself to the store and just buy three packets of the pearls and the shakiras. The store is besides the oxxo. They usually have them in little containers like ketchup? Something like that. I put on the dress and make up. Nothing fancy or extravagant, the usual. I drove down and entered the store. There was a young woman and an older one. I asked them if they had something like those and showed them the two little baggies of pearls. They told me no, and then looked for the shakiras. They had a plastic bowl filled with bags of tinny and shinny little pieces of plastic of several colors. They looked inside one that matched the one I showed them. A boy with uniform and a backpack came and asked for the homework he just sent to the printer. They turned to him and answered his questions while making the transaction of my things.

I paid for the bags and they referred to me as she. "Give her back her change" "She left me without any change, she's going to take it all".

I drove back and paid half of the price from my money. I returned 90 of the 100 pesos that my grandma had given me to pay. I stood in front of her with the red dress. It was fine, it didn't matter that the colors didn't totally match.

Before I left to Catherine's she came back again. "You look really beautiful... You're mother is delighted with you, you knew it, didn't you? You knew she would be enchanted with it". No, of course not. I did not know how she would take it.

I stopped at the gas station. The dispatcher saw me as a lady, even after hearing my voice he thanked me and wished me a good evening, "miss".

I ate with Catherine's parents. Her mom cooked flautas and lentils. I sat at their table with the red dress and not once did they refer to me as Ivan. Her grandfather sat with us. He talked to me, he saw me, he made no mention. Did he recognize me?

We went to the university. I saw Felix and Ivan. I saw Brenda and Ivan Hernandez. Waiting for Jhonny, I hugged and congratulated Gabriela. Leo asked us to take a picture of him and his family. Nayely was the first one to see and say hi to me. Her friend saluted me with a kiss. Maybe he didn't recognize me. Maybe he did and didn't care.

Jhonny came out and I hugged him. "Woman!", he said to me. We took pictures. Ivan and felix and Tere and Sarahi, greeted me and hugged me as well. "Who is she?", asked her kid to Sarahi, "Her name is Sofia". Aymee saw me from far away and I noticed her eyes on me.

We went and greeted Zayra. She asked us how everything's going, how are we doing. She looked at me but made no mention nor comment of my attire or looks.

Walking back to the car, I see a bald man driving a green car. He was wearing shades but I noticed his eyes crossing mine. He turned but his face stayed on me. I recognized him when he finally exit. "Monica's dad"

We drove to Playas. We went to argana and was welcomed by new waitresses. They saw us as girls and brought us our moroccan tea and hookah.

Before Catherine got out of my car, we tried the lipsticks we bought. The wedding is close. The graduation party, the first party I'll go as Sofia is closer.

## 2016-09-02

"Im tired.

That was not a quote. They were the first words I murmured before I started typing. It's an hour before midnight. Tomorrow will be jhonny's graduation. The dress is ready, the sandals are ready. I have more make up to apply. I won't be alone, Catherine will be by my side the whole night. This will be my first night as Sofia. No, I've had plenty of nights. I lived first by night and in hotel rooms. This will be my first party.

My nails are painted. I painted them today for the first time. The polish feels like a coat of plastic wrapped around my finger, pressing and pulling. It's a weird sensation. Even after all this weeks, I don't fully get accustomed to the idea of not hiding. I closed the door when I painted them. I exited the room with the face and clothes I showed to Rene. My parents were in the living room watching a movie. The've seen me, they know me, they love me.

It should not be unbelievable.

Last night Miguel came to my room and told me that he might need me to bring the television to his school. It would be in the morning, he'd need it by 10am. He'd send me a text message around nine if they would need it. If I would not hear of him by ten, he would not need the favor.

So I put the alarm clock at nine to be awaken and ready to his call. I kept waking and falling again on and on, postponing the alarm and answering Catherine's texts. I was nervous of getting the message or call. I wanted not to change or get up. I'd not have time enough to get ready to take it and then go to Rene after. I'd have to go in my pijamas. I just hoped he would not need me.

Fifteen minutes after ten, an arabic woman sang from my night table. I grabbed the phone nervously and looked the name of my Aunt Cruz in the screen. I answered but heard nothing. It might had been a pocket dial, maybe. Should I get nervous? As I showered later in the morning I imagined her telling me she got an offer to adopt both of the puppies. They'd prefer them to share a home. Best they not get separated. Who could I be to deny them that?

I made myself eggs with sausage and tomatoes. I shaved my pubes and used the other face of the razor machine to clean some of the subtle stubble of my chin and mustache. I put the jeggings and hesitated between the red and green blouse. I put the make up usually as I do. I took the brushes that I bought yesterday from Dax. I opened them and took the foundation one out. I did not use it. In the envelope it said it's for powder. I applied some concealer and blush. I looked at my face a little different. I looked different. Was it more feminine? Was it better? Worse? I could not tell. I just left.

I drove to Rene's. I parked the car in the plaza where I usually do. I walked to the building behind the hospital but made a stop in the Oxxo. As I passed the counter of cafe inside the market, one of the baristas said: "Can I offer you a drink, miss?" I walked ahead to the fridge and grabbed a bottle of water. I paid for them to the cashier that once complimented my hair.

"Hey, how are you?" "Fine, you?" "It's been a while since you've come" "Yeah, a while, I guess" "Yeah, good bye, have a good day".

She recognized me. But was I the young man she saw or the young woman that had been there?

"You've been going femme lately to Rene" Catherine replied to me as I told her by text.

My session with Rene was normal. I talked to him about Mexicali and the course. I talked about my wanting of a puppy and wish to care for others. I told him about my thoughts about never being a mother. The feelings that come with them.

Entering the building and at the bottom of the stairs was Brenda Zavala. She was with me in high school and then in college. Did I have her on Facebook? Did she know about me? We waved each other, anyway.

I went to Dax in the mall, I looked around in Sears looking out for something to wear on my hair. I found nothing. I bought a primer for eye shadow and the white eye liner that forgot yesterday.

Luis is not home. He's in school in his camp for the first night of the weekend.

I miss him a little.

## 2016-09-03

The day has come. The dress is hanged on my closet. The shoes are still in their box. My nails are painted but I'm still in my shorts and blouse. It's 20 minutes until 5 in the afternoon. In a little more than two hours Catherine is going to come. I feel tired and a strangeness in my stomach. I woke up early, not as early as Catherine, but before my mom and grandma. I got up and was the first one to open the paper bag that my father brought. I ate my biscuit and left the other one. Did I return to bed? No, I was on the couch. Is it nervousness or something else?

Before my mom and grandma left for school I did return to bed. I watched some episodes of Adventure time and heard them heading out. I returned outside with hunger. I looked for items to munch on. Early on I felt the pressure to fill this huge lacuna of time. Now, I see the minutes counting down.

I am nervous. I am a little worried of not being able to look nice. What if I end up looking weird? What if I look manly?

The reception card is inside my wallet. My father left to buy pizza. I ate at noon the other biscuit I left in the morning. I watched an episode of friends and told Catherine my intentions as if I were asking her permission.

I was again in bed when my mom and grandmom returned with Luis. They thought I was asleep, and Cande asked about me. "Has sofia eaten yet?" They argue a little if I were outside or not. "He was outside, he was here lying on the couch". His words do hurt. Why do I pretend they don't? I do understand, I know where they come from and the difficulty behind them, the struggle. But they don't hurt any less because of that comprehension.

"I did not see him", say my grandma after. As if seeing me as what I am not were contagious.

Will he still see me as Ivan, his son, when I shower and put make up on and wear the long dress? Does it hurt him as well?

He just arrived from buying the pizza. 10 minutes until five. When I asked Catherine the time that I should plan to start getting ready, she told me five. She plans on coming here by seven to help me with my hair. It's just arriving and saying hi, doing my hair, taking the manuals and her mother's feet bracelets and leaving.

What are the things that I have to do? I have to pluck my eyebrows, wash my teeth, eat, I guess, and maybe stopping by the bathroom. I have to shower and shave my pits and legs. I have to wash my hair and body. I'll shave my face after. I'll put the moisturizer on my face and then put the mousse on my hair and form the curls to let them dry until Catherine arrives. I might start with the make up. First, I'll try the eye shadows.

There is another anxiety. That is the new thing I don't really know how to do. I've seen videos on the internet, some tutorials and tips, but they're not really useful. I did it once, Aidee helped me, she was with me and saw me and guided me.

I should be going out and started eating.

What will happen tonight? After both of us get ready and go to the party, after they took our receptions and let us in, and show us our table. How will it be? I was nervous about seeing Tere and Ivan, or other graduates. But I've seen them already. They have seen me in a dress.

There is nothing new. I'll be me in a party. I've been me outside, I've been me in bars and restaurants and other places. I've been me with friends and family. What's the difference? Is it uncomfortable to realize there is nothing new?

There is something new. This is a graduation, this is a formal ceremony, a long dress night party. This is not a going out to bars, the first time of those was nervous and exciting as well. Now I don't need to worry about being asked for an id.

This time there won't be an after party. This time I won't sleep besides Catherine with a hungover.

This time I won't need to drown in alcohol to bare the suit. This time there is not going to be a suit. That is change enough.

## 2016-09-04

I feel this urge against writing the words. It's been 80 days of continuous writing. Why is this so tiring? Is it that I am running out of things to say? More than four months of hormones and changes, yesterday was the graduation of jhonny and my first evening in a long gown. It's not that I have nothing to say, just that I feel this defense against it.

seven hundred and fifty words, three pages approximately. The conversation with Catherine is in another tab. This morning as I returned home I considered sitting in my desk and typing this day's quota. I did not.

So I finished yesterday's words in the afternoon so I would not have to feel pressured about getting ready or returning home or finding the time to type them in the phone or cheat.

I got out of the shower with my body shaved smooth and my face ready. I put mouse on my hair and applied some cream in my face. I was nervous about starting with the eye shadow. It was something I just did once. This time I would be seen by several people. Time kept running and I started. It was difficult to find a place where I felt comfortable. I stood in front of the full mirror behind my door and then sat in my bed with the hand mirror Catherine gave me Thursday. I did them calmly and slowly. The end result was a subtle change. Even with the full make up, the difference was noticeable, but I looked natural. Catherine put it as "you look subtle, natural, like a good girl".

After the make up and hair I put on the shoes and finally the dress. The open leg looked better than I had imagined. The nervous of getting out came again. It's not about fearing the reactions or comments. It's about being seen, being exposed. I am vulnerable, I am true to myself.

I asked my mother to break me a note of 500. She did and made no comment about my face or clothes. It was until later that she asked me if the dress was from when I bought the other one for the wedding. "Yeah, for 20 dollars, too".

I looked for the tag and showed it to her. There were still some minutes until Catherine's arrival.

She sent me a text. She was here. I opened the door and received her. She helped me with my hair after greeting my mom in the couch. I went up for the container with my mom's hair pins. My dad saw me as well. Catherine tied the upper half of my hair in two meeting braids. She tied them with a hair pin that she lent me. Finally, she separated the curls and farmed them thinner. She started on my left side and when she got to the right, she kept the same orientation, changing the original one from the final side. The right side of my hair puffed up in frizzed as the curl was formed in the opposite side. She fixed her hair and I turned them as they were with some more mouse. I looked fine, although I felt a little nervous and uncomfortable.

We left to her car and she drove. I expected to see some known people besides Jhonny and Tere. There might be Ivan and Felix or someone else.

She turned around after we were in line waiting for a parking spot and the cars behind us started honking. The second time around the door of the parking place before the mall was open. We parked in the yard of the restaurant I went with my mother. Inside the salon, the first person we met was Melissa. Had I seen her since I told her about me? This was the first time apart from two days before that I saw a lot of people.

I was treated as a woman by every single person. The ones who recognized me hugged me and told me how happy they were to see me, the ones who don't, just looked through me. The waiter, as he realized that there would be a missing plate in the table, asked the man whose turn it was if he would like to cede it to me instead. He accepted.

I waited in line for the bathroom, not a single person looked at me judging or suspicious. I waited for my turn and used it. I was greeted by men with a kiss in the cheek.

Today, the boyfriend of Gabriela, Antonio, added me on Facebook, and sent me a message saying how we never really talked before, but he wanted to say to me how I looked really good and happy.

"It feels really different wearing a dress to a suit" "You look different, you look more happy... No, you just look happy"

More than a 12 hours of sleep, a mid afternoon nap and I'm still tired.

My mom just came down to eat dinner and I took one of her burritos. A student of hers gave it to her. It's of potatoes and meat. In a mason jar I put some apple juice.

I'm chatting with Catherine on the other tab.

"are you feeling bad lately? Your grandma told me she's been seeing you tired lately and with a falling face or without energy, you're not eating lately"

I have been eating. I've eaten more than I should. But is she on to something? I was lying on bed by 10 last night. I fell asleep after some minutes. I had several dreams. I remembered them at the time. The were about nothing extraordinary, the same old wanderings through fantasy. I came and went several times in the morning, each opening of the eyes was futile and every turn or intent to getting up fruitless.

12 hours after falling asleep I answered Catherine's text and got up to eat breakfast. Candelaria was cleaning the lentils and putting the rice to cook. I decided not to use the stove and took the leftover biscuit from yesterday. I ate it in the couch while I looked for something to just hear on the tv.

If I keep trying to find things to narrate about the doings of today, I won't even get to half of the words when I'll be sick of this.

I saw the post I shared about the contest of the tales. Tales about sexuality. I posted it like a month ago and I've not even started the plotting of the draft. I had several ideas, I remember. Had I forgotten about it or just ignored it?

Months before that I wanted to design a research project about a state of the art of the knowledge of trans people in the education and health circles. I wanted to do surveys or even just interviews.

Even reading the threads in reddit about the transgender people has lost its interest. I remember being in Spain and looking at the messages and comments, people talking about the changes they were experimenting with hormones, a month, three, six... coming out to their family or going out, their procedures and surgery, their doubts and realizations.

I read them with longing and thought of them so far away from me. I never commented nor posted anything, be it a question or anything to share. Time passed, and with it, it went and returned. I dealt with it again since the very beginning and told my friends and my parents, I started with the blood tests and the meetings with the dr. I started the treatment and came out, I went out more and more femininely. I am full time, now. I go to the school and out of the city as Sofia, I meet my family as whom I really am and everyone treat me with respect and admiration.

I read the posts and even though I'm barely beginning I see them so far behind. Their problems are no longer mine. I have started HRT, I've told my family, I've gone out both in my job and my school and my social life. I have no doubts about who I am. I know how to keep in check the occasional feelings of self-hate and disgust with my own body. The changes in the short months I've been on hormones are notable and effective. I'm seen as a woman most of the time. I'm happy and people notices.

My life is not perfect, I am not done. I hate myself sometimes and feel the dread of the things to come and the sadness and frustration of what I can't overcome. I see my body and still see traces of that costume I grew so attached to. I can't let go of the rest of his clothes. I still think of the supposed friend who left. I still cringe when I hear my dad avoid pronouns and names, I still feel let down every time he lets the old name slip out.

Some days, like today, I can;t find the energy to get out of bed, or the will to do anything. I want to escape, be it in a children's cartoon or webcomics born from the fantasy of strangers. Even escaping to a half-read book is too much.

Something keeps me from trying, from starting long-term goals.

I am scared of leaving them unfinished. Of failing.

Maybe that's why continuing with this is more and more tiring.

## 2016-09-06

I'm in bed. I'm not as sick as a week or two ago, when I threw up, and had to cancel my going out with Catherine. I haven't cancelled anything. The symptoms started today. It was after waking up. I don't remember dreaming anything or getting up in the middle of the night. I can't remember most of the night. My father and mother were arguing outside, in te living room where the printer is. Some paper sheet must had gotten stuck in the tray. My mother asked for my father's help. His actions were not precise enough. She warned him he would end up breaking the thing. "I don't know what else to do. I don't know about any secure or level to move. If you do, show me, but I don't."

My mother told him, to stop messing with it carelessly, that's how 'they' broke the last one. She talks in this way when she asks for help. She and my grandma has this thinking of how someone who has more knowledge the them about technology, must know everything about it.

They don't seem able to comprehend how we get to know about it. It's not like we were born with it, or had this genetic disposition to get the functionality of stuff. It's that we're not afraid of the machines. We look around, move around and mess with it. We pressed the buttons and set the preferences and see what happens. We experiment and try a different learn. We started just like her, in front of the screen with an intention and a need. When she comes to me or Miguel to ask us how to set the paragraphs the way she wants them or to turn off certain alarm, we have the same knowledge as her. We hand her device and start as clueless. Slowly we move and try and search until we get it. Sometimes we can't, or we have not enough time or energy to stay trying. She gets mad. Why don't we help her? We know. It's as if we had her answer and kept it from her. How could we be so selfish?

Lately she has not come to me for help. When I remember those instances of compute assistance, I grouped her with my grandma. Edgar, my brothers and I are the ones to help them. Were it not for my father, I'd imagine I'd be a thing about age. Is it about gender?

Is that why she no longer asks me?

I had to get away from the tablet. I guessed it was supposed to be more comfortable writing in bed, yet I don't feel it. I saw something move in the pillow under my chest. A brown small dot, running away. It was a spider. Was I once afraid of them?

I killed it. I don't like them,i don't like the thought of them wandering around in my bed as I sleep.

In mexicali one of the times that I stayed a week with my grandma, I remember how I was scared of going to the bathroom at her place. I could pee just fine, but showering or shitting was unconceivable. There were lots of small black dots moving under the toilet. Would they crawl to my legs as I sat defenseless and vulnerable? What about in the shower, naked and with my eyes closed?

For six months I showered in Spain. There was no curtain but a plastic door that had magnetic latches. The shower head was a handle that could be placed in a mount over our heads or maneuver it with our hand. That was the shower Consuela and I shared.

I haven't heard from her since my coming out. She added me on Facebook and liked something, I guess. But there's not been any message either way. RaÃºl hasn't added me, either. He didn't use Facebook much. Alberto knew and added me the same day I posted it.

The sounds are crisper and more annoying. My nose is running. I ate two sandwiches and a cucumber and a bowl of lentils.

My mother asked me how I was feeling. I told her the truth. My father would go to the pharmacy, he could buy me some pills, antiinflamatories for my throat. I asked him for some antihistamines, as well. I'm running out of estrogen. I did not ask him for those. Yesterday my mother gave me money for therapy and another 500 for pills. I could buy them from there.

Tomorrow I'll see RenÃ©. I could go to the pharmacy after my session.

## 2016-09-07

It''s actually very early. My stomach is again twisted in a knot and I feel the food that I haven't really eaten stuck in my throat.

I need Catherine, I needed her more than ever, but she's not available. Maybe she left her phone charging, maybe she went to sleep. Would be able to tell her anyway?

Miguel respected my privacy. He knew since I was in Spain, or maybe even before,and said nothing. Maybe he came to the knowledge just as I did. No. None of them are like me... But he is, that's this whole deal.

I went to therapy. I talked with Rene about trivial stuff. "What has happened lately?" I mumbled in session. I had nothing in mind to talk about. We ended up focusing mostly on the bureaucratic procedure of changing my name and records in the university. In there I got nervous. He mentioned several times if it was possible for me to do the change before applying. It would be easier, he added, to get in as Sofia instead of changing the record later.

I felt pressured, by time, by the circumstances. Getting out I walked to the car and there was a person now in front of the speakers outside the oxxo. Another man was with a tray offering samples of milkshakes.

"Friend", he called me on the microphone as he faced me, " do yo fancy to try this milkshake?"

I could not hear the end of his calling. Was I a female or masculine friend? How did he look at me? I felt hit and insecure. I sensed several sights and walked with shame to my car. "Does he notice me? Does she? Are they going to say something?"

Sometimes this is hell.

I was home and Luis phone was in the coffee table. I was reading about the university and an article about the discrimination some people feel on campus...

Someone called, from Mexicali. I told Catherine. I did not want to get the phone. How would I answer? What would I say? I don't feel like doing this now. The phone stopped and then started up once again. I answered with a hello. The caller thought I was my mom. I didn't identify the voice. I feel sick even now. I said she was not around and asked who I was. I ignored the question and took the phone to my grandma.

The call has finished and she brought the phone back. It was my aunt Cande. She is still here by the door, asking me if I told the dr about hte pills I'm taking. No, they don't affect nothing of that.

I keep avoiding it. I wanted to come to the computer and typed and I can't. I can't. I thought about it over and over for an hour and now I can't even mention it.

I read the messages. I opened up his messenger and looked at his conversations. I know it's wrong, I know I did wrong. He hasn't talked with Anaid. I had just warmed a bowl of rice and beans in the microwave because I was hungry. I read how his conversation with her. He used friend and ambiguously ended the word with a @ symbol. I started to worry. He wrote in feminine once or twice. I lost my appetite and started to get sick. He mentioned once he feels depressed, he feels sad and unworthy. I could had left it there, I could had just used it as evidence that there is something with him and just tell my mom to take him to someone. But I didn't stop, I scrolled up and reached an ignored message. He's suffering, he's atheist, he's trans, a girl trapped in a man's body who doesn't believe in nothing and likes nobody. I could read the frustration and misery and hopelessness and recognized them...

I had seen those signs. I saw them and recognized them before. They scared me and worried me. I went to Rene and told him my fear. I tried to ignore them, I let them go. I came out and told everyone and he said no more. If he felt something he could say it, come to me. Nothing happened until today. How would I had responded had he spoken?

How can I support them?

What if they don't believe them? What if they blame me?

I can deal with this pain and suffering. I don't want them to go through this. Why am I so scared about this?

"3 ways you can know if you're falling for with someone" "How can you know if you're trans"

Yesterday I used all the free time in the night I got for doing the words early to worry about Luis. I thought a thousand things. What could happen, how serious everybody would take him, how serious should I take him? What could my parents say, how would my dad react?

I cried various times for several different reasons. I was drowning in my head, I was poisoned by the guilt. How could it be my fault? Would anyone attribute it to me?

The last message I sent Catherine was one asking her if she had fallen asleep. I heard the voices of Miguel and my grandma. He accepted just one of the burritos she made him. Then I heard Luis and everything came back. I doubted him how I never really doubted myself. "But he's so handsome, and seems so happy and fun"

There was a message from Catherine where she answered my last question from the night. "Yeah, and really early, too" She asked me if I wanted to talk about yesterday. She apologized for not being for me. I told her I did not know. I didn't. Did I want to talk about it? What would I want to say? I spent the whole afternoon of yesterday and almost all night repeating everything to myself. As if saying it so many times would make it less real.

Less than a percent of the population.

After a while of staying in bed and failing to get back to sleep, I got up and ate something. I had no appetite and no will to prepare something. I heated the burrito that was left and ate that. I lied on the couch and try to distract myself with Law and Order. Even my free time shows are about sexual deviants.

As the day passed I learned to be calmer about everything.

What has to happen will happen. I can't do anything. He'll come to me whenever he's ready. At his age I did not think about any of this. I lived my life as it was. He's young, he might be confused. He's having all this changes of his body and peers and relationships are something new. He doesn't even know if he likes anybody. He doesn't know what he likes.

And his message lights up like a fire ink on my mind. I'm an atheist, I don't believe in anything. I'm trans, I'm a girl in a man's body, I don't know what I like and I just want a daughter.

I should had recommended my mom to take him to a psychologist. Look someone up, maybe we could had avoided all of this...

But there is nothing yet to avoid. I came to know because I snooped where I shouldn't had. I remember the message of my mother ex-student. One of the twins. I thought about him when I came out to everybody. How would he take it? What I know of that person is real? Why does he keep his hair so short? how does he do it? How can he take it?

My mother, later when we talked about that day, she mentioned him. She cried because of the emotion and after what my grandma said and after reading HIS message in Facebook. He just added me but said nothing. Did he make a comment? I took notice of my mom's mention but thought and did nothing.

Until today. I thought about her phone and her ipad. I had looked Monica's profile from her Facebook. I could see the conversation, yeah, that's the reason why I'm in this mess in the first place, just like I found Miguel's stash of woman's underwear that other time I snooped around. I don't seem to learn. So I looked for her ipad in her room. It wasn't there and I went to Luis' for some reason. I grabbed his ipad and tried the password I know. It passed after a moment of uncertainty. A chrome tab appeared, in it there was a picture and text, it was a page of wiki how. How to know if you're falling for someone. It was... fitting. I thought of a coming to age sense of confusion and discovery. There were lots of tabs and I looked at the rest. Two were of the same subject. Other three were how to know if he were trans. Others were lists of baby girl names.

I told Catherine, but it wasn't like yesterday. He's young, he's twelve. Even if he were totally sure and my parents were totally supportive and he had the total backing of a therapist, he would not start on hormones. She?

They would start in hormone blockers... if. Until fifteen or sixteen would he start.

There is no rush. There is no pressure.

"You confused me as well, when everything came up" Catherine said.

She came and picked up my grandma's gifts to her mom.

I told her about Alan's suicide attempt, and when she answered, her voice broke. I asked her naively. "He was your best friend and tried to commit suicide... I thought when my best friend considered it, too"

## 2016-09-09

Tomorrow I'll get the puppy. "She's really anxious to get her new owner".

In the morning I felt a shivering cold, and the freezing sweat of a feverish nightmare. I got up to the closet and brought down the thick cover. Do I remember my dreams? No, not really. I think I told Catherine a little about them. She and Miguel, her friend, and someone else, were in it with me. We were killing time before going to a party or a meeting or somewhere.

I got up with a burning ache in my throat. Just an hour ago did I return home.

"One like I don't notice" was the caption of the new profile picture of Omar Moncayo. The first comment was from Monica, that said she loved him to the moon and back. I rolled my eyes.

Getting up I was not hungry. I am anxious and worried about Luis' discovery. I had new messages from Catherine and Eusebio or the gang in the conversation, I don't recall. Catherine said she felt itchiness under the tape of the electrodes. She was uncomfortable. "Sofi, I was going to tell you if we do see us after they take the machine from me?"

What? Don't she want us to meet? That was the plan, we were going to see each other after she returned from the clinic and took half a shower.

"Do you mean if we see us after as in the afternoon or as in another day?" The minutes passed and she stayed silent. I rememberer my distaste to when she asks me a question and then goes away. Five minutes passed and I sent another message. "Now you don't answer."

"I don't know..."

20 minutes later she said I made her anxious. She hates cancelling, I know about it. She hates dealing with the permissions.

We talked about it and came to an agreement. We would see us after her return, her shower would be complete. Her time to be home was 10 o'clock.

I made myself breakfast. At first I just ate the burrito Miguel left and took my pills. I took out the ingredients from the fridge, some meat, half a tomato, some onion, sauce and two eggs. I prepared the pan and cut the stuff. When the eggs were ready I was no longer hungry. I ate the plate in steps an hour, maybe, later.

Something happen with her mother and a friend of hers. Her plans changed. She and her mother went together to the clinic. She'd take her to where her father was near the bus station. She'd be home later than planned. There was no problem. I was almost ready. Just some make up and I was done. My hair was done, my clothes were on me.

I grabbed the ipod and listened the podcast I downloaded yesterday. "Stealth mode, how to be a girl", it was narrated by a mom of a 6 year old transgender girl. She started with a day in the pool, somebody looked under the stall as she was changing her daughter. I was telling about it to Catherine when we were sitting in the pizzeria, bizzo pizzo, in playas. The peeking kid got the girl anxious. The mom talked about the burden of holding a secret like that.

Catherine almost cried when I got to the part when the mom talks about taking her to a new summer camp. She filled the registration form with her name and age and... gender: male or female? Should she tell them? She put Female. Must they know? Could she trust her daughter to deal with the situation if someone knew?

"Do you want me to tell one of the teachers about your girl penis?" The kid began to scream No. I could hear the desperation and fear in her voice. The mom calmed her down.

Catherine's eyes filled with tears.

We ate a pizza with pepperoni, ham, meat and chorizo both spanish and argentinian. Each of us ordered a craft beer. Mine was Tangerine IPA and hers was a chocolate Stout.

From there we went to the Dax in the plaza. I bought a little bottle of nail polish and a bigger one of acetone to remove the one already in mines. I drove towards Argana. We were welcomed as ladies and lied on one of our usual places. In Dax, I read the conversation of the gang. We talked about the dresses. Paola said hers don't fit. Jessica doesn't have one yet. Catherine's fit enough so she can't gain any weight. Mine is a little loose so I don't mind. Chevo posted "insert here a joke about me not having a dress either".

It was... weird. I was one of the girls. Paola posted how he could have one and added an emoji. It was a little uncomfortable.

In argana we talked about movies and relationships. We smoked and ate.

We stayed a couple of minutes in the park and continued our chat. Tomorrow we'll go to get the puppy. I am as nervous as I am excited.

## 2016-09-10

We're in Mexicali, I'm sitting in my uncle and aunt's couch. We saw the final of the woman's championship of tennis. A Czech and a German. After the match and the victory of the German, the adults went to buy food.

Luis woke me up in the morning, it was just a couple of minutes after 9. Was I going to go to Mexicali? Was I going to shower?

I showered and dressed. I'm wearing the denim shorts and the duck tailed blouse. I put my make up and did my hair. This is the first day of the weekend. I grabbed a carton box of Miguel's room and the oldest t-shirt I had in my closet, the brown one of pink Floyd.

We ate pizza and teriyaki with chicken.

Last night I could not sleep. Was it the excitement of today's trip? We need to buy milk. When I sent the message to Anahi about my puppy, Paola asked me if I had a bowl and a bed ready.

I was lying in bed with the lights out. I saw the unfinished episode of the anime I had started, Clannad. It's supposed to make everybody cry. I don't need anymore a reason to be sad and crying. I'm a depressed trans young woman, my baby brother is confused about his sexuality, too. It's been difficult to everybody in the family and now I'm the only one who knows about the signs, and now symptoms, of him.

After finishing the anime episode, there was a recommended video of "a Texan in Tokyo". In it an American woman married with a Japanese man talked about, uh, what was it ablut? The eight most expensive things in Japan.

Seeing the video, before playing it, I noticed some resemblance to Monica. The woman had a circular white face surrounding her eyes were big and enframed by dirty blond hair.

At first I just ignored it. Like a shooting thought that you miss in a blink. A while into it, there were some other things that brought black memories.

The way she laughed, or her high fake voice, or some facial gestures. It was impossible to ignore. Her smile was different, she had big teeth in a full smile, her eyes were blue and warm.

I liked her husband, too. He had a charismatic familiarity that brought me back to my time in a foreign country. I watched some of their videos, time passed and I closed the tablet by two and a half in the morning.

In my dreams, I visited Catherine in a hotel room. We were there, I don't remember if we did something. What I do recall is the walking out of the room and meeting the other dirty blonde from my past. She asked me to meet. Weren't you mad with me? Don't you have a boyfriend?

We ended up in a different room, she took her top off. Did we kiss? Why didn't I leave? She asked me how did we wanted to Fuck.

"like a wife"

"do you want me to be the wife or treat you as one? "

That should had brought me back to the reason why we don't even talk to each other... What did I expect to happen? I can't even perform in sexual relationship.

What happened that I left?

I went to a third different room, and some other things happened.

In other dreams I tried to escape from this building. The offices were rigged with explosives, opening the door made the bomb blow and kill all the people inside and the one who opened it. The exit had a similar rigg system. There were different lifts and there was a reason it was difficult.

The third dream I was in a different building, a certain expo of this new artifact that utilizing the brain waves let the user have telekinesis habilities.

They said how it was difficult at first, but concentrating and with time you could move a thing.

I put the diadema on my head and moved the first one easily. I learned to move several at the first time. It wasn't automatically or even easy, it was hard, but achievable.

Lastly, someone took the band from my head but I learned how to do it without the machine.

We're still here with my uncle. The cat came and lied besides my leg. Edgar came from school. I noticed the awkwardness of greeting. Should I extend my arm? Should we hug?

In an hour we'll go to get the dog.

## 2016-09-11

Nymeria is by my side. She's in the carton box sleeping peacefully over her red daisy flower cushion. I made the words in Mexicali, we were in my uncle and aunts house. I was nervous about being with them, being welcomed. Not that I would not be accepted in their home, but how would they do it? Would there be comments or questions? Would their kids say something or do something?

Nobody said nothing. Everything went fine. Diego and Aldo greeted me normally and made no face or comment about my clothes or appearance.

I had forgotten about the hearing ads in Spotify. Yesterday before leaving I unsubscribed from the premium account. Now, three of their ads are playing between songs.

I feel tired, I left the deed of finishing the words until almost midnight. We were already in my uncle's house, almost leaving to pick up the puppy, and I was still nervous. I would not feel calm until I had her in my arms and sensed her white fine fur. Had she grown? Would she recognize me and be comfortable with me grasp? How would I feel the way home if she cried as I take her away?

We got there and the person who opened the door for us was my uncle. I passed stealthily and a little anxious. Would he make a comment or a joke? I, even know, can't even imagine what he might think about me.

My aunt gave me the vaccine booklet with the date of the next appointment. In two weeks she'll be two months and I'll be five on hormones. She also gave me a spray for training her to potty and a bag of cookies and a half-full bag of puppy food.

She did not cry on the way home. She was sleeping and calm. She stayed in her box and made no sound all the trip.

In my room I place the carton box in the place I had reserved for her. I place if with the opening facing up. It was an hour after midnight and she was awake. We played a little and she pissed and pooped. I fell asleep an hour later, and another hour after that, the dog started crying but went back to a quiet sleep. In the dawn she cried again and I pulled her out of the box. She peed again. Later I would realize that she cried because she could not get out and had peed inside the box all over the t-shirts.

Today I picked Catherine from her house and she came with me to buy the things for her. The necklace, the pillow, some toys and the plate for food and water. I bought a mop and a bucket and the training mats. She took a picture of me with the dog on my lap. I know the one she referenced to. Catherine appears as a child with a very young MuÃ±eca in her lap.

It's weird being around Luis. I can feel his awkwardness and discomfort. I can't not look at his projecting despair. I see my past self in those eyes. And I want to help him just as I wish I could help the young me.

Even if he's like me. He's ages ahead. At his age, I wouldn't even dare to tell it to anyone, even say it out loud. He's more prepared than I ever was. He's not alone. He has me as a role and a guide. But would that be enough?

Yesterday, when we were on our way to Mexacali there was a conversation in the gang group's of Facebook. Did everyone have electricity and water home? There was a black out, apparently. It was all around Baja California. I knew about the march defending "family" that would take place all over different states of the country. I did not know Tijuana was going to be one of them.

It was a weird feeling. Even now I can't take it of. Thousands of people gathered and expressed their discomfort and repulsion towards the laws implemented to help the LGBT group.

Their basis is religious, some "morale". Even before realizing my own situation, I was against them. Why would they feel that way and ask for the abolishments of other's people's freedom?

Now, it's different. Now they want to take my rights away. Now they are marching so I can't adopt a kid with Catherine. They're marching so we can't get married.

Today I read how they marched so I won't be able to change my name and gender marker legally.

And, I guess until now, I never fully understood the meaning of being a "minority".

"Sofia's is pretty"

Catherine stopped by Anahi's house after getting her hair cut to leave the reception for her parents' wedding. Anahi just sent us a picture of the dress she wore at her graduation. Her mother liked it and told her she could wear it for this saturday.

This was Nymeria's second night here. Just now she's in her flower cushion asleep. The internet says puppies usually sleep between 16 and 20 hours. At first I felt inept with her progress being housebroken. If I want her to keep being inside I'll have to successfully train her to hold her bladder and advice her need to go.

First I have the training mats, but she hasn't been using them. Yesterday and this morning she went on the newspaper besides it. Today I could move her a couple of times to the mat. I took her out twice.

At night I didn't get up. I waiting until just before sunrise to turn on the lights. She doesn't go and use the mat until I turn on the lights. My grandma was talking with Miguel. Later, after my mother left, I turned on the lights again and fed her for the first time in the day. I get this weird nervousness. As if I'm going to fail her. I have this fear that I'll mess up in some way and it will be her demise. If I can't take care of a puppy, how could I ever take care of some other form of life?

Are those people in the marches right?

No.

It's Monday. The start of the week. Again it was just my grandmother and me. Nymeria does make use of my time. I have a reason for getting up in the morning. I had not forgotten about Fernanda. She was my first patient as a psychologist. She'll be my first patient as Sofia. This is another layer of difficulty to an already complicated occasion. She studied psychology. She is Liliana's patient, maybe she already knows about me. I don't know.

I was scared and nervous. How could I reach her? What would I charge her? Must I called her? I sent Lilli a text asking her. She'd see her tomorrow.

I sent her a message. She answered almost immediately. She was just about to call me in the afternoon. Actually, she was driving home, could I wait for her? Of course.

She called me Sofy, after I answered her doubts. We agreed to meet us after her session tomorrow at 4. The day after I'll see Rene and talk about what I read and the feelings I don't really know if I've repressed or dealt with.

This started as a diary. No, it was just an exercise to practice my english and redaction skills. Then I used it as another tool to deal with my emotions and fears and thoughts. I started more than a year ago. I've writing almost daily. I went to Chevica's grad and started antidepressants, I started hormones. I told my mother and my family and the world. Lots of things have happened and they've been recorded here.

It came the use of recording the changes and transition I've been experiencing.

The tablet just made a sound. Did I receive an e-mail? Maybe it's a Facebook notification or just a new YouTube video.

What has happened with my body? I took a picture yesterday after Catherine asked me if I was naked. The cleavage shown by my blouse was impressive. I have changed. My face looks different enough. My body looks ambiguous.

My nails are back to their colorless nature. Maybe by the end of the weekend I'll paint them with the new and more obvious red tone.

Tomorrow I'll see my first patient, again. The day after I'll see Rene. The Saturday I'll meet Aidee to do my hair and make up, later I'll attend the so mentioned wedding. The week after I'll take Nymi to the vet, her next vaccination.

Both Catherine and my mother have called me her mom. Am I that? Does it feel right?

I was maybe four years old when a teacher started this game where we walked in a big circle and made pantomime. We acted as the different things she called. A dog, a police officer, a mom.

It was, hard. Something clicked and repulsed me. How could I act like a mom? I could be a dad, but not a mom. I was a boy.

And now, years later, I feel this heartache that I, actually, could never be a mom.

## 2016-09-13

I heard her screeches near three in the morning. I turned on the lights, did she have her belled collar? I can hear when she scratches how the little bell jingles. She moved and peed in the mat. I turned the lights off again hoping she returned and went to sleep. The next time I woke was a little after seven. This time she did not return to her bed. I was lying in mine and turned the lights hoping she'd return, but she didn't. I turned them again and stayed with her. Did I take her outside? It was cold. We returned. We stayed playing and doing stuff until she fell asleep a couple of hours later. I took the opportunity and caught some shut eye.

My grandma got down. She helped me take care of Nym. I really needed and appreciated her helping hand. I don't know how could I would had gotten ready if it wasn't for her. She helped me with training her. The little puppy stayed in my thighs on her back. I scratched her belly and her mouth was open. Her little legs moved almost at the same rythm my hands did. She fell asleep covered in the white piece of t-shirt I lend to her.

I took some pictures and posted them online, both in snapchat and Facebook. Nym is asleep in her flower bed. I had to scream at her because she's been playing with the mat. After it, she walked shyly to the bed and lied down. Did I scare her?

It's tiring doing the words. Maybe it's the lack of sleep, maybe it's all the bundled and bottled up emotions that I keep carrying since I discovered about Luis.

Today was supposed to be my first session as Sofia and tomorrow would be my therapy. I put her today so I could see her before my session. Rene sent me a text message in the evening asking me if he could see me the day after tomorrow in the evening because he'd be out of town tomorrow. Sure, what is a day more.

I was changed, I wore the burgundy pants and the new blouse I hadn't worn. A long sleeved, gray blouse. I put on my make up and took a picture so Catherine could confirm me that I looked fine.

The patient knows me. Lili sent me a voice message asking me to "give her a call". I did and she asked me about Fer. No, I went ahead of her. She wanted to asked me about the other patient she wants to give to me. Someone whom she's been seeing for a long time. She comes to her for months or a year and then goes off before returning the next time she's on a crisis. She wanted to ask me, come to me and see if I would be ok with seeing her, treating her. How would I take the idea?

She had asked me before. She kept referring to this patient as her and she. The last time she told me she was a transgender girl.
Today, she got to the theme: "she's other, she's changed so much... she, uh, she is a boy inside a girl's body, she's trans".

So, he is a trans guy. How old is he? Would he be ok with me treating him?

I agreed and accepted it, she would ask her patient this saturday? She'd call me later. We returned to the patient of today. She had told her, she could be seen "by Catherine or Ivan, now Sofia". She took it as something totally normal. How was I feeling? I told her at first I did feel some nervousness, but later I felt calm.

She asked me later, how would I feel easier? Did I want to tell her myself or she could talk about it before in their session. I said she could mention it and anything I could clarify later.

I was all dressed and with Nym outside. I came in to my bedroom to put on make up. Almost to the last minute I ate some burrito. I got in just in time to the office. They were both sitting in the waiting room.

The session flowed naturally. Time passed like a breeze. I applied both of the tests and we talked a little about her school life.

Tomorrow I might paint my nails. I will send the picture I saved to Aidee and set the time of our meeting. Tomorrow, Thursday I'll see Rene, Friday is free for now, and Saturday will be the wedding.

Time do passes really fast.

## 2016-09-14

It is tiring having Nymeria here. She's licking my toes and I feel her moistened warm tongue strokes. Just now I changed her beds.

In the afternoon, while we were outside in the living room, she liked to go into the couch, the place between the two of them where the phone is. The plastic box in which she came was in there with the newspaper. I brought it out and placed it near the couch. She lied in there most of the afternoon. It's hard for her to get into and out of it. It's possible, but she has to try. So I thought it was a better bed for the night than the cushion in which she doesn't even stays.

Now she's in my thighs liking herself. She's passed to pull the button from the flier of my pajama buttons. Does she know there is something in there?

Having it here is a way so I can work. I know here she won't go piss and I don't have to be turning and monitoring her. I put her down. She started scratching and growling. Maybe it's her way of asking me to leave. I love her. It's nice having someone who follows me and cries when I'm not here. She needs me and cares for me.

In the early morning, near 4, I turned on the lights and she took the opportunity to go and do her business. She at least uses the newspaper. When it was time to return to bed and turn the lights off, she didn't want to. I turned them anyway and she wandered for the room. Without its bell I tried to locate her with the faintest sound. I turned it again and noticed her besides my bed. It wasn't until I heard the newspaper shredding with her bit in the dark that I corralled her with the carton. She cried and moaned for half an hour until she fell asleep. In the morning I noticed how she had peed the flower.

Today would be a lazy day, without Rene's session and nothing to be ready for.

She's sleeping now. I might take the opportunity and lie down as well after I finish these. Catherine is in Playas, she just sent me a text message moments ago.

I have the test to grade and look about the labor outlets of my patient's choices. There is no report now.

I painted my nails. It was easier now than the first time. I put two layers on my hands. I took use of the time Nymeria fell asleep in her old new bed.

I received messages from Lili and Aidee, I had thought about sending the pictures to her. It looked like she read my mind.

Lili's was an audio, in it she asked me to tell her where was the group's chat. I answered her and send a message so she could see it. She would buy the Wechsler Scale for Children. I thought about applying it, I wouldn't mind. I'd actually like it. But there is a girl who specializes in children.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. I have a dog now, it's hard and tiring. It's rewarding, though. I saw my first patient as Sofia. I might see another one, who's trans as well. And, over all else, I read Luis' message and saw his internet search. I noticed his doubts and worries.

I shared them. They curse me now. I feel awkward with him and I hate this. I feel hypocritical about it. Why do I feel bothered when he, in my place, was so calm.

Tomorrow I'll talk about it. After that, it's just one day until the wedding. Friday something will happen. I don't know, maybe I will go out with the family, maybe Catherine will ask me to go with her friend and or cousin somewhere. Maybe I'll stay in bed. Who knows.

And then saturday, the so waited day. I'll see Aidee by one, as she agreed. 500 pesos will be what I'll be paying her. My mother said she wanted to go to the mass. I do, too. I am worried, though. Would the father mention this last march? Or these new laws about the homosexual marriage? Do I want him to say something? Do I look up to being antagonized as if I'd be validating or something?

I should be expecting the ceremony, seeing Anahi and Chevica and the Paolas and being with my family all dressed up and pretty.

I am pretty.

Yesterday was it? When my grandma made mention of what Edgar told her. "There is nothing to say..." "About?" "I saw her, she's beautiful, my niece, my little sister. She looks so pretty, there is no doubt, nothing to say"

I thought my fingers would look huge and ugly, but I like seeing the color on its tips or looking down to my toes and being surprised by the colorful of them.

Let's see if Rene makes a mention of them tomorrow.

## 2016-09-15

Nymeria is asleep in her box. I moved it next to my bed. She's peacefully lying besides the little fluffy dog that Luis owned when he was a baby.

She woke me up again in the dawn. Like a clockwork I turned the lights on by 4 in the morning, she used the light as an excuse to cry. I took her out and before I could think about it, she peed on the floor. I brought her outside and she pooped almost immediately. She's been doing her things outside. She's getting trained. Just once has she pooped inside since yesterday. The urine is harder to anticipate and, for her, to control.

When we returned she didn't want to stay in the box for much. As I turned the lights back off, she started crying. I let her and turned. She lasted way less than the night before. We didn't get up again until the morning. She did her business outside. It was 8 in the morning, I think.

Catherine did not go to english. She talked to me late yesternight. She asked me if I was asleep, later if I was angry.

It was a little frustrating not getting answers from the texts. I understood she was busy. Was those feelings jealousy? Or am I envious of the relationships she has?

We were in Playas when she was talking about going out with Vania and her lady friends. It would be a friends' night, no couples. I could not go. I am not her boyfriend, but I am her partner. It was weird, not being welcomed. I want to go out, meet her acquaintances. See if they notice me, if they clock me.

"Did you tell your friend about me?" She just took her to the bus station today. No. They didn't talk. They made no mention of the present. It's alright.

Today I would shower and go to my session. I could talk about Luis today. I made myself breakfast. My grandma left some chopped tortillas for me in the fridge. While I was distracted, Nym took her last shit inside the house. I ate breakfast and stayed in the couch for a while. Not much later, both Miguel and my grandma came down.

Miguel did not go to school. He had just one class today, but it was cancelled. When I returned from Rene, my father asked him, no, confirmed if he failed a subject. Yeah, chemistry. The regulation test wasn't what he expected. He will have to take it again. He was not angry, not explicitly. He was disbelieved, surprised, mostly disappointed.

I took opportunity the first time Nym felt asleep when my grandma put her the dress to go to the bathroom. The second time she was asleep after we took it from her I showered.

We took it off. It tired her. It was like something took all of her energy away. She didn't move, she stayed mostly in the same place. Not even when outside. It was like the flicking of a switch taking it off. She started jumping and turning and playing again. Maybe it was the heaviness of it, or the warmth and coziness.

I thought I could put it to her by night so she could use it to bed. Maybe this way she'll stay asleep most of the night.

I showered and changed. I like seeing my crimson red nails with clothes. They look different when I'm not wearing pajamas and my face look feminine.

I left home 20 minutes after four. I parked the car where I usually do and walked. The sun was unforgiving, but the shadows were cold and breezy.

I got to Rene's floor by the elevator. There were some people by the opened door. Two women, one looked like a patient and the other her therapist or something. The one client-looking saw me and kept quiet. When the other one turned to me, I explained I was going to see Rene. She let me in.

Just as I was seating down Rene called me by the phone and said he was on the Buena Vista ramp stuck in traffic. I waited half an hour for him. I didn't mind really. He apologized profusely when he came in, but, yeah, I did not care.

I talked about Mexicali and the marches and Luis and being a mother.

I passed by the pharmacy and bought the pills. The pharmacist referred to me as lady. I drove home and found Nymeria asleep.

"Was it hard?" I could not hear her. "What did you hear?... I asked you if it was hard for you, to paint your nails"

My grandma mentioned again what she said in the morning. "I told her that she needs to go to the laser. It looks a little" My mother confirmed it and I felt uncomfortable.

On its time. On its time.

## 2016-09-16

"Why don't you read Ivan's?"

Sometimes words do hurt. Sometimes they're harder than stones and sharper than daggers. They stab straight to the hearth and poison your insights with doubts and sorrow.

I woke up again just a couple of minutes past four. I don't know if I woke her up or she woke me. I took her outside and she did her business. We both woke up at 6 and again went outside, this time it was harder to return to sleep. I messaged Catherine and we talked for a while. An hour, maybe, later, I faded away and didn't open my eyes until a quarter to nine. I gave Nym food and exited again. I saw the paper bag from the Carl's jr and thought my father had brought us food. It was the bag from yesterday when they went to get it for us.

My nails are a dark red. I wore make up. I asked my father what would we do today. He said we'd go to the United States. Miguel was in the bathroom so I stayed with the dog. She fell asleep again and I took that opportunity to shower. I didn't shave my body. I shaved quickly my face. Just one pass, I didn't even lather with the bowl. When I came downstairs the flower cushion was empty. My grandma told me how when Nym woke up and didn't see me, she went straight to her bed.

I finished getting ready. The hair, the clothes, make up. My clothes were nothing special, jeans and a blouse. The blouse is old, it's the black one from the first couple of times that I bought clothes. I wore the thin cardigan I've carried so many times and wore so little.

My make up was natural but noticeable. There was no shadow. My lips were a subtle pink and my eyes just colored enough to be noticeable.

The dog stayed with my grandma. We crossed the border. There wasn't a long wait. It was almost the same amount of time that we stayed waiting in the secondary inspection. If it weren't because the first words of the officer were that he would send us to secondary inspection, I would had thought that it was because of the mismatch between my appearance and the picture in the visa.

We went to eat breakfast in Denny's. The waitress was nice. It was a mixture of speaking both english and spanish. There was no gendering. Luis is the only one who constantly refers and calls me accordingly.

The first one was Miguel. I don't remember when. "No, I told Ivan". He said it fast, his words passed like a shooting star. Even now I doubt if I heard him correctly. From the dinner we went to Best Buy. My mom and I stayed in the car. In there she proposed me of seeing one of her workmates. The one who sees her in the role of a mother, the one who was jealous of me being her daughter.

I told her it was alright.

From there, we went to target. I bought a wallet. Simpler, more casual than the one I have. I didn't bought any clothes, but I did get underwear. Catherine made the comment of how it was a little creepy that I still use the ones she gave me. I hadn't given it any thought.

I bought the puppy's shampoo and food. I bought her a collar and a long snake toy.

I accompanied my mom seeing the make up. She helped me pick a foundation.

Later, just moments before we'd leave. My dad and Luis and me were waiting for both Miguel and my mom. Luis was wandering around the purses area. He looked at the same one, and then the other. He checked the price and opened the zipper. I felt anxious and worried. I wanted him to get away from there. It wasn't because I don't accept it. It's not because I think it's bad. It's that I am scared. I am scared of him following my steps. I am scared of my parents reaction.

I asked him "will you take it?", pushing him, purposefully make him to get away. He challenged my bluff. He explained how he didn't think the price was worth. He took another one with more pockets and said he would take that one. He was going to tell my dad.

I ran away. I heard just the traces of the first words he said to him. I did not stay to hear their answer.

I did not see the purse in the cart. It wasn't relief what soaked me.

We went to many stores. Plaza bonita, two wal marts, Barnes and Noble. I bought a book light and a zen board. You write or draw with a water brush and the draw stays until the water evaporates. It's a reminder of the fugacity of life.

In the book store, it was the first big misnaming. My dad called me Ivan, but there was no sorriness or regret in his voice. It was sure and non-caring. Dismissive.

From there there were countless more mistakes. "Here you were born Ivan... Ivan Sofia" My grandma misgendered both my and my dog. "He follows him." "I'll put this here, son" and so many others. My mother did correct her. Did she notice my face?

Does she now sees the pain behind my understanding?

Tomorrow is the wedding, less than 24 hours from now.

I stepped on Nymeria's shit. I hope it will the first and last time. I don't know how I'll do it with the food. I don't know how I'll do with lots of things.

## 2016-09-17

Wedding.

## 2016-09-18

 Nymeria is right here by my side. She's confused because I went to get her food but haven't given it to her. Yesterday she only ate twice. Once in the morning and a second time in the late afternoon. We went to the wedding. I almost forgot to write those words. I am exhausted. I don't feel with energy enough to sit and write. I've been here for a couple of minutes now and I've gotten up twice. The first time I went for Nym's food. The second I got soda in my mason jar cup. I never really thought I would be drinking diet coke. When I was little I used to drink coke. It was sugary, sure, but I liked it. The taste of the diet one was weird. Then, when I grew, I stopped drinking soda altogether. Why is it that now I crave it?

Yesterday was the wedding and I didn't write the words. I was already in the church when I remembered that I would not have an opportunity to. I asked for Miguel's phone and cheated. I thought I could do twice of the quota today and I'd be alright. But this evening I wasn't even sure I could finish these.

I could fill this page up with yesterday's wedding. I went to Paola's, Aidee, house. I left here 20 minutes before 1. The clock just marked the hour when I was in the boulevard approaching the seminary. I heard the arabic song from my phone and saw her name in the screen. She told me she was a little busy and was going to take a shower. I could wait inside her home. It wouldn't take her more than 10 minutes.

She did my hair. We talked about several things, how was high school for her. Her latest dating encounters or potentials. She even made us wonder when would we ever imagine we both would be there, in her house, doing my hair and make up. How would Monica take it?

"What would your father say? 'You look pretty, Ivan'" There was no malicious intent in her words. They stung like the bite of a snake.

My father asked me before leaving the approximate time of my return. I estimated around three, maybe? We finished half an hour before 5. I returned home with a hurry. I asked them to be ready and dressed, and I'd just put on my dress and shoes and we'd leave.

We got to the ceremony just ten minutes late. It started early but we didn't miss much. I hated the priest and his words. It was weird being inside a church in my dress and make up. My grandmother kept glancing at me. "She looks so pretty"

I was looking at Catherine, two benches in front of us with the hopes of her turning and seeing me.

After the mass was over, everybody took pictures with the bride and groom. My mother asked me if I wanted a picture. I told her no.

It wasn't because I didn't want a picture or I did not like how I looked. I was afraid of their reactions after seeing me. How would they react?

After the church we went straight to the hall. We were some of the first people to arrive.

When we approach them and congratulate them, Cath's mother called me beautiful. She asked my grandma if she was Sofia's grannie.

The party at first was difficult. I didn't deal with the burden of wearing a suit but I was still alone. The waiters and photographers referred to me as female. It would be weird if they didn't though. How did my father took that the photographer asked her to be behind the other two ladies?

Luis sat with me at the second table. The first one to come with us was Anahi. She sat by my other side. Chevo Jessica and Paola were next. Vania came before them but left to say hi to some people. She greeted me and called me Sofia. Were she and Miguel surprised of how feminine I looked? When Miguel left after midnight he said good bye with a kiss.

Nymeria was here in my room by herself. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous or waiting for a mess.

The party ended by four. They gave them another two extra hours because of all the setbacks that happen. There were problems with the lights so the party was music-less for the first couple of hours. The dinner came late and was totally different of what they had ordered.

I felt a little excluded at first. I wished Catherine didn't have to be by other places. I needed her by my side. Anahi started being awkward and silent and Luis, although he tried, was a little uncomfortable with the grown up people.

After the first half, things started to get better. The music wasn't just the live band. We danced. Luis got up and danced, too. I stood with all the ladies to catch the bouquet and both Chevo and Luis went for the leg thingy.

Today Catherine told me how I could use a rolled newspaper to get her out of my feet when she'd bite me. The sound is what scares them. I took her advice just now. She squeak and went straight to her bed. Was she sad, scared? Did she want to play and just went straight to sleep? Does she hate me now?

The room was all clean but for a small spot of urine by the door. There were several marks of wet in the mat and a couple feces. She was clean, she was alright.

Why do I keep thinking she's going to die? Why am I afraid she'll leave me, too?

She lies quiet, rolled up over her blanket.

She woke me up like everyday but at 7 in the morning. I was awaken and already had eaten when my father went for the breakfast. Catherine told me she'd go to the United States and if I wanted to go with her. At first I thought about saying no. I would just spend money. I would spend gas. She offered me a ride. It would be a short evening. She'd just buy pants, and polos and shoes. She was tired. So am I.

I showered and told my parent separately.

My mother was showing the video she saw that made her wonder if she was wearing her earphones wrong. It was a video showing how the shure earphones are worn upside down. I explained her, was it friday?, that the earpods from her iphone don't work that way.

"Ivan told you" said my father.

No, Ivan is dead. Ivan never existed. Ivan was never real.

Why do those words sound so stupid to me?

I am "Ivan", I am their "son". I might be their daughter now, and I may be called Sofia, but legally, officially, I am their son Ivan.

We crossed the border and waiting in line. Is this the first time that I've waited to cross in these new crossing? I handed my visa card to the female officer. I didn't notice at first, but I gave it backwards to her. She turned it and saw me obviously different to the person in there. My hair is longer and different, my face is narrower and fairer. My eyes look bigger and my chin smaller.

Doesn't matter how I look, the officers will always see the male person named Ivan.

I have more information about the process of changing my birth certificate. I saved the picture. It states the procedure of verifying the residence in the capital.

I, still, have to return to the state and change the records with the new certificate and a voucher that states the procedure from the capital's civil records.

There is still time left. I still have lots of things to do before that. I have books to finish, patients to attend, formats to fill and applications to send, tests to answer and interviews to attend. Flights to make and waits to endure. Moving, looking for apartments. Lots and lots of things before even worrying about that.

We crossed and took the bus. The first stop was the Wal mart near Anahi's work and soon Catherine's. We looked for her shoes. I saw some too. At first I took a pair of sandals. Then I saw that the long boots were just 20 dollars. Some short boots were the same price. She tried two pair of shoes and I had five by my side.

I ended up taking the brown boots and a pair of jeggings. She bought the third pair and a black polo.

We went to Palomar Street, the Dickies that's besides Ross. When we entered she asked for ladies black trousers, and the saleswoman asked for whom.

She bought a pair and then we crossed the sidewalk to the McDonalds. She ordered two cheeseburgers and I a fancy one with guacamole. Hers was 6 dollars, mine was 10.

From there we went to the trolley and back home.

I had forgotten to feed Nymeria. When I left, Miguel told me that Luis was in the bathroom, he was showering because he'd be going with me or something. After leaving target, I felt bad for him. I put myself in his shoes and felt rejected and left behind. I keep projecting myself in him.

Yesterday in his words, I caught a glimpse of his doubts if he loves her or just likes her as a friend.

Huh, I did finish twice of the quota. At least I have a reason to not feel bad about something.

## 2016-09-19

Half of the test is scored. The scores are all put into the table, just the sums are left. Nymeria is here by my feet.

"You're fine there, daughter"

She's alright. The spots on her crotch and back are just irritation cause by the lack of her mother baths. I took her to the bed. Just now she left the room and went to the kitchen. She peed just inches out of the mat. I used the newspaper when she started to bite it. She barked at me with her cute puppy screams. I went for her and brought her her. Will she stay by my side?

She woke me up twice this night. Once by three in the morning and another by six. I have a notification of Chevo's conversation. He must have sent a meme.

I like seeing Nymeria play. Move the little giraffe that Cathy gave her with her jaw.

Last night, there was a storm. When I took her out after midnight, I could see the lightning as we got back inside.

I dreamt things, but I can't remember. They mustn't had been important.

Today is Catherine's first day of her first job. She got up in the early morning and went to cross the border. She sent me pictures with the uniform she bought yesterday with me. I got up and ate breakfast. First it was a burrito left behind by my mother and brothers, then I heated the biscuit fro yesterday. I took my pills. Tomorrow is the last day before the estrogen break. The day after I'll be turning 5 months on hormones. My fifth month. I keep seeing the pictures of the wedding. I waited for that day for so long. I wore the long dress I bought with Catherine, I wore my hair styled by Aidee and the face she lend me.

I'm standing there, as the woman I am.

Tomorrow I'll see Fernanda again. I tried to finish interpreting her test, but with Nymeria is hard to concentrate.

I told her I would do research about the job market of her options, but I didn't. Am I a lousy psych?

I showered and got ready for the vet. I knew today was the day I had to take her to the second vaccine. I didn't really wanted to. What was I afraid of? That they would ask for my name? Talk to me as a man, or a freak?

I put her in a box after I dressed and drove to where I remember seeing the vet place. There were no issues. I got to the reception and a nurse welcomed me with a smile. She asked me to sign in their sheet while she made faces and caresses to Nymeria. She was still a little sick from the drive. They would call me, so I sat with the carton box on my lap.

Right now she's sitting besides my feet and licking my heel. I feel her warm fur on the side of my foot.

I saw a man in scrubs having difficulty reading the handwriting and sensed it was my turn. "Ny...Nymia? Sofia Fernandez?" He called and I stood up. He weighted her and asked me how everything was. I answered his question and made him some of my own. He asked me to hold her while he applied the injection. I felt what I imagined my parents dealt with when I cried before a shot. Her high cry made my hairs stood up and sent a shiver down my spine.

She's stopped licking and is now resting.

Tomorrow I'll have my patient and the next day my session. I asked Catherine to go to Argana, the beach. She said yes and we were both excited for a while. I saw her yesterday and I already miss her. I want to hug her and feel her cheek with my lips, and the tip of her fingers sliding by the skin of my neck.

I am a little tired and nervous. How should I close tomorrow? Will it be the last session with Fer? Will Liliana say something about the patient she would send my way? Should I mention the one my mother might send me? What if she denies me seeing her? At first I said I would not give therapy. Although she asked me if I'd dare to give therapy to english speaking patients.

Jhonny asked me when could we see him. This friday will be his show. Catherine told me she would contact him herself tomorrow after she checks her schedule.

She had to cancel our plans for wednesday. It's Vania's birthday. It's the dinner at which I am not invited. It hurt a little more because of that.

## 2016-09-20

Nymeris is right here by my side. She's so small, like a little rat, indeed. I remember seeing MuÃ±eca as a little dog. Today that I entered Catherine's house and was received by her, she seemed huge, almost enormous. I guess I've grown accustomed to the petite figure of Nymeria's body.

Today I received a friend request from Alejandra Olachea. She was with us in high school. Us? Who am I referring with us?

Alejandra's house was the hosting place of the last holiday party. In there Benny talked about me and Monica. In there Omar and Roger slept and Ian threw up and they called his father to pick him up. I went to that party. I had long hair and was thin as a stick. I apper in pictures as a skinny young man with long curls and a melancholic smile. Monica was in that party as well.

Alejandra got into Psychology as well. Was she in our group in first semester? She wasn't around by the second one.

I recognized her from the second I saw her name besides the picture. She was the one who told Monica were I was the first day of classes when she visited me in the faculty. "Oh, you're looking for your boyfriend?"

Later she sent me a text saying "Chulisima, how have you been? Did you finish school?" I didn't know what to answer. Why was I uncomfortable?

Yesterday I had plans with Catherine of going this wednesday to Argana, later she remembered how it was Vania's birthday. We cancelled.

Late at night, I received a message from Fernanda cancelling today's session. She is already in collage, she picked Communication. I sent Catherine a text saying my session was cancelled so maybe we could go today, meet up. She agreed. The plan was that she'd shower after getting home and I'd pick her up. We'd drive to the beach and smoke shisha and drink tea hearing the rain outside.

Nymeria got me up in the breaking dawn and then the early morning. She was asleep by eight and didn't eat until nine. The morning was as lazy as they come. I made myself breakfast. The sound of the rain set this atmosphere of coziness and rest.

I showered in the early afternoon. Catherine didn't answer back until after 2 when she got out of her job. The rain didn't stop. I was already changed. I wore the red leggings and new boots with the long blouse. As she told me she was on her way home I put on my make up. I felt pretty. Even in the morning as I got out of bed, I saw my reflection and smiled. I can see the differences that mark the time between my beginning of treatment and now. My shoulders are narrower and my arms thinner. My breasts are fuller and my skin paler. My face looks warm and delicate. I can see emotion in my eyes.

It was a gut punch when Catherine sent me an audio asking me if here the rain never stopped. There was lots of traffic and her way home seemed infinite. Maybe it wasn't a good idea going out today. The way to the beach is long, the freeway always gets inundated when it rains. Lately I've become more affected by driving.

I could see myself all dressed and made up lying in the couch. I'd be staying here, home, again. I felt little droplets of water forming in the corner of my eye.

I didn't give up and proposed her to go somewhere else. It was a good idea to cancel the trip to the beach, but maybe somewhere closer? We could go to eat something or maybe the movies. I wanted to see her, I wanted to be seen.

She told me finally if I wanted to watch a movie in her house. Her house is now almost empty, just a friend of her mother. I agreed. We could eat there. Anyway, I prepared myself a burrito of meat with potatoes of yesterday and went.

Her mother introduced me as a little friend of Catherine. "Sofia" I introduced myself. Her friend prepared chicken a la poblana.

It was the meal they were supposed to serve in the wedding. I saw them as they cut the chiles and onions. I saw the chicken before being shredded. When they asked for the sour cream and the cheese I knew the dinner would be a little awkward.

We watched Lilo & Stitch. When I got home, neither my mom nor her dad had arrived.

Rene confirmed our session of tomorrow by 1.

Do I have something to talk about?

## 2016-09-21

"Are you angry with me?"

Is this anger what I am feeling? I was irritated, I was angry with Nymeria when she kept peeing and pooping everywhere in the house, when I called for her and she ignored me. I felt anger when I was at the crossing border and the policeman went to the parked cars and left the lights in manual mode. I was disappointed when I had to tell jhonny that I wouldn't be going to his show.

He was really understanding, he told me not to worry. He said he loves me and maybe we could go out later.

Why didn't I want to talk with Catherine when I answered her back that I felt awful?

In session I spoke about the latest occurrences. I talked about going yesterday to Catherine's and the wedding last saturday and going both times to the United States. Being with Catherine and being with my family. The time that Luis asked for a purse and when my dad addressed to me in a forgotten name.

Today is the day of rest. Could it be that? Just five times have I rested from the pills. Or is it four?

I have been five months on them. My face looks a bit feminine even without make up.

Nymeria is by my feet. Just moments ago she saw me cry for the first time? Does she understand what happened? Dogs can detect when people are happy and angry. Does she recognize sadness?

I had her here on my lap when I started the words. She growled for some reason and I put her down. In the evening after returning from Rene I sat with my legs crossed on the floor and she climbed my legs to lie on my thighs. Her head rested and her eyes closed. Her tongue is warm. She rests now, with her head on the other leg.

Does she love me? She recognizes me. Her behaviour changes when I am around. Does she like me?

In half an hour I'll feed her again. Is that why she's grown accustomed to me? Is her love conditional? Isn't anyone's?

I feel this huge gray mist of sorrow over my body. It's heavy and cloudy. I can't see, I can't hear, every move cost me tons of energy. I want to lie down and just cry. I did for a fraction of the day. What is that I think about?

Catherine cancelled friday's plans. It's not her fault. It will be her great aunt's funeral. Her shifts are open-ended. She doesn't know when can they end.

"Do we meet him tomorrow?" She asked me about jhonny. "Don't ask me, just tell me. I am the one who doesn't have a life"

Is that how I feel? Yesterday I had no patient. I have no other one next. I have no job. My outs are with Catherine and that's it. I am shut in this home. Everyone, every single person of the group has a job. Anahi has had hers from years. Chevo and Jessica got theirs even before finishing school. Paola has had many to support both her and her child. Paola found one. And Catherine now talks about going to work and being tired and her shifts. She posted the image of her cap on the group and everyone congratulated her.

I wanted her to have the job. Why do I feel this way? What is it, is it envy?

I could apply to jobs, look for one.

But I don't. I don't send resumes nor search for openings. I haven't even redacted a curriculum. I am scared. I am afraid of filling it. I don't want to face the doubt of picking a name to put on top.

With what face will I face the potential employer, with what name will I introduce myself, with which voice?

I've been rejected and ignored when there was no sign of being trans on my resume. What can I expect from now?

Nymeri has fallen asleep. She scratched my leg and upped her eyes. I picked her up waiting for her to throw a bite. She just accommodated herself and let her conscious go.

Just fifteen minutes until I wake her up and give her food.

Catherine answered my denial of anger saying Vania is. She did not go to her meeting. It's her birthday. She got sick, she has the flu. She got soaked yesterday and had the premonition about getting sick.

None of us had continued the conversation. Anahi didn't reply about her proposal of going to Las Vegas on New Year's.

## 2016-09-22

I feel different. The cloud seems familiar, but there is something peculiar, odd. It's not like I'm used to.

I remember this feeling of just wanting to shut off. Lie down and plug out. Ask for a free time, a pause of life. I'm exhausted and embarrassed because I've done absolutely nothing.

Catherine is right, I did avoid her. All of yesterday I did not talk to her. She did talk to me, she told me how she had the flu and did not went to Vania's reuning. Today was mostly silence. The day started abruptly. Is there a reason why I mostly don't remember my dreams?

Nymeria didn't wake me for most of the night. I was the one who turned the lights and it was already morning. It was the biggest spot of pee she has ever done. I have her again on my legs. After getting up at eight, we went to the living room. I didn't have the energy nor the motivation to make myself breakfast. I stayed in the couch and she lied on her flower bed. She was calm and sleepy. My grandma stepped down an hour later and prepared something.

That was the high of my day. I did not talk with Catherine nor anyone. She asked me last night if I was asleep, but she didn't answer. I returned the question and she replied at dawn. Nymeria has fallen asleep again. Does she like being with me? I love having her like this.

For a time I had her over my legs on the couch as well. I even took a picture and posted it on Facebook. It has like 30 likes now. Even Yadira liked it. Yadira does know about me. Should I send Zayra the email? Why?

Yesterday my emotional concern was my lack of life, my void in actual goals or purpose of life. It seems like I'm in a limbo, stuck in a stand-by mode until the next year. We are almost ending September. Three months and it's gone. In two months the application process will be open. It's not that much.

Gilda posted something in the group. She has a potential patient who is in a grieving process. I could treat her, I could attend her. Why didn't I replied? Iris is the one whose job is to give therapy.

Nymeria almost fell down. She slipped her paw and fell from the chair, did she grasped the carton barricade that I placed in front of the desk's leg opening or was I the one who caught her on time. She was alert for a while, but she let herself down again. How does she trust me? Not even I trust myself.

There was a posting in the faculty group. Yolanda's still looking for an assistant. Someone to watch her reception and tell her when a patient arrives. I wouldn't even be answering phones, she does that herself. I saw it, and remember months ago how I said to myself that the next time she post it, I would call. I don't feel like it. It's not even a full day that I wanted something to do and now that the opportunity arose I don't have the courage to call. I don't know, no... I do know how. I just don't dare to call and introduce myself. Which voice is my own? Which one is my name? Yolanda, kind of, knows about me. It's more probable of being welcomed by her than a stranger.

I am afraid. I don't know what to do. I know what but not how. I know how but just don't have the courage to do it.

And so I waited on the couch, hating myself. I feel the same urges to cry and the self-pity, and I look for the same kind of articles that call for the known commenters who feel the need of stating their opinion about people like me.

I showered Nymeria. I saw her all wet and vulnerable and tiny. She trembled covered in the towel my mother used to cover me as a baby. I held her tiny body in my arms and dried her delicately.

I did my laundry. I got her outside again so she gets used again to doing her stuff outside.

Catherine had a job meeting this afternoon. The conversations in the groups flowed, but ours were stale. There was a silence between us that was broken with a snap from Anahi's account. Will we talk again tonight?

Do I want to talk? Will it help?

I feel like I've made myself this question thousands of time before. Why can't I remember its answer?

## 2016-09-23

I had another opportunity to call Yolanda and ask about the position. This morning I could sleep more than usual. Nymeria didn't wake up until 5 in the morning. Once again at 8, when it was time for her to eat. This time it was different. After her meal and me putting her on the mat, I brought her again to her box and both of us returned to sleep.

She's by my feet now, licking my heel. I should feed her again. It's time. Have I been writing my words earlier?

Again Catherine and I didn't talk until after her shift was over. I don't remember much about the morning. I ate one burrito that was left by somebody as breakfast. I lied mostly in the couch, with nymeria either by my side or over my legs.

I have a strange aching in my lower back. Even reaching a fourth of today's quota is hard. The rain has stopped. The clouds have dissipated. Days are bright again but my mood is still shitty. Not as shitty as before. Did I take my hormones?

Yeah. I had to check.

Tomorrow is the last day of resting. Five months.

My mother hasn't arrived. Luis told me yesterday he had a party. I would not see him until after 10 in the evening.

I read it about in his messages. This time it was from his ipod. I should not snoop. It's wrong. It's not my right. My worry is not an excuse nor a reason. In there I could see it's not over. He referred to himself in feminine and talked about the return of "Leslie" (?). It was a female name starting with L. More than 60% of gender non-conforming kids get over their gender dysphoria by puberty. He is starting his. Does it mean it will be over?

Paola S sent a message saying it was really short-notice. But their friends organized her a gathering in a house near the cacho area. We were invited. It's the first time she invites me, and the gang, I guess, to her birthday party. I read the message and thought how I did want to go. I don't care that there will be strangers. Even the idea of people realizing I'm trans or hearing my non-convincing voice does not dissuade me. The thing that made me unsure was that I don't really know if Chevo and Jessica will go, Catherine and Anahi both work and Anahi is not even in the chat group. So, would I be alone? Being all by myself and surrounded by strangers is another whole thing.

By that time Catherine answered back. She wasn't sure either. Paola A sent another message to the group of the four of us, asking if we wanted to go to a pre-coup.

I'll take the dog outside in case she wants to shit.

She didn't. She just peed a little.

Catherine said she preferred the idea of going with Paola. I don't know what I could wear. Maybe not a dress. Something more casual.

And Nymeria just peed, again, in the mat. Or is she just sitting?

Today she climbed the stairs to the second floor. When I called her to come to the mat in the living room, she would bark and then lie down.

I put the dress on her and she's lying on the mat again, crying . I put her on my legs. Do I do it for her or for me?

Catherine answered my texts about how I feel shitty about the thing with Yolanda. She knows or imagines how I feel. It's frustrating knowing my name is not the one on all my documents. How the person who I am legally has almost nothing to do with the one I am on the inside and outside.

Catherine sent me a picture that I had seen before:

Someone graduated at 22 and got a job at 27; another one graduated at 27 and already had a job. There is somebody who is still single and has a child. Some, married, had to wait 10 years until being parents. There are who have a partner and love another, and there are who are lovers but nothing else, and others who are still looking for love. All works according to our personal clock. People can only live by their own rhythm. It might look like your friends are ahead of you, or behind; but they are in their moment and you in yours. Live with patience, be strong and believe in yourself. It's not late, you are not early. You are on your time.

## 2016-09-24

The 100th day came without notice. I didn't realize until today that I turned on the computer and saw the number. Was the last longest streak almost 200 or 300?

Today Nymeria woke me up again but nor as early as before. I turned on the lights and saw that it was 5 in the morning. I decided against taking her outside and instead guided her to the training mat. Both of us returned to sleep and and get up until eight in the morning, time to feed her. After her meal I convinced to, again, come back to sleep. I heard my grandma chat with Miguel. He was going somewhere today. A course or conference or something like that.

I woke up by 10. Yesterday was the plan of going to Paola S meeting. Paola a invited us to a gathering before. At the final moment it was cancelled because her parents wouldn't be able to babysit her son. Catherine would be returning by the beginning of the actual party, so we decided to see us Sunday I instead. Another cancelled plans.

It was a suckerpunch to resize when I got out of my room that my father and Luis had gone to the United States. They usually wake me up and ask me if I want to go, if I'll shower. This time I asked my mom and she told me. Was it on purpose? Did my father preferred to avoid the awkwardness and possibility of being questioned about my appearance and situation?

I was left behind. Another day without a reason to get out of the house. I felt lonelier than ever.

Paola asked us to confirm and I had to cancel, again, just like I did with jhonny's show. Chevo and Jessica were going and I considered changing my mind. No, I felt awful. All day I've been meaning to cry and just wanting g to hide under the sheets and let the days pass.

My mother said my father was coming and he'd be bringing tacos from the taco bell. He doesn't know how to order for me. He always take the chance about mocking how he ways has to change the order of my food. I hate not being able to eat cheese. I hate not being as normal as he wishes.

I denied the breakfast my grandmother prepared. I went to shower thinking that I hadn't since Wednesday. Did I cry in the shower? It was yesterday that I fell to the floor in sorry a bawled my eyes while Nymeria sniffed the backyard.

Today it was in my bed. I didn't care about Catherine's and the experts advice and brought Nymeria to my bed while I was overflowed with emotion. At first she stayed calm between my arm and body. Then she started nibbling the skin of my hand and forearm. Lastly, when she bit my nipped I took her down.

I slept in the afternoon for like an hour. Catherine had ready returned. She sent me an audio.

"I'm worried about you, Sofi. I don't know how to help you, what to say. And the things surrounding you don't seem to help you either."

Yesterday I looked a video of The School of Life. It was called her with to help the ones we love. It talked about the frustration of jot knowing what to do to ease the pain of our partners. We approach them with the estrategy of what would help us, a d when it's fruitless, we end up feeling resented and frustrated. It talked about the different possible approaches. To some it's a listening ear what they need. Others prefer practical solutions or ideas. To some it's a reassuring optimism and "everything will be right" that helps them. To others, it's a pessimistic understanding that is taken as companionship in their situation.

What is it that I need? What would help me? What am I expecting of her?

I understand, kind of, what is it that bothers me. My dad called me Ivan three times to get my attention and give me the money of the week. I didn't dare to say anything or correct him. I took his money and left with the feeling that he gave it to me as compensation of his denial. A bribe or conditioned help that would stop the moment I break the bubble.

I feel trapped home, isolated. I feel trapped in my own unability to make the call or redact the new curriculum. How can I introduce myself as Sofia when it's not really true? It is not official yet. And again, I am trapped in time. Until I get out of here I can't do anything to escape my life as Ivan.

Today came a man giving the yellow section, the phone book. He asked for my name and I gave it to him. I introduced myself as Sofia FernÃ¡ndez without hesitation, without caring that I had no make up or my hair tied up or I was wearing man's pajama bottoms.

I said it as if it were true, official. Late tonight I finished the registration of the emergency app.

Will I surpass this self entrapment that I reside in now?

Is hope a bad idea?



## 2016-09-25

I really am trying not to cry. I am doing my best.

Why does it seem like everything got in motion exactly with the intention to make me feel shitty. She asked me yesterday if I wanted to go out. We could had gone out yesterday and I could had seen her, and I wouldn't be crying right now. I hate she has not signal or way of communicating with me. Just yesterday I told her that it was legal for her to have an open-ended shift. She doesn't know if she'll work four or the complete hours.

Yesterday she asked me...

I am going for the roll of paper. I can't contain the tears. I feel so miserable and weak. I feel like an idiot. I am so alone.

I said that I preferred seeing her today, that I could see her more. We could use the time. Nymeria keeps coming out of her box and biting the linning of my bed. I put her in there again. The first time it was just grabbing her and putting her down. The second time it was with force. The third I wanted to throw her.

I feel anger. I am angry but it's not at her. She might be desperate right now, thinking about me.

Why did I just throw away my phone? Why do I feel this way?

It's just another day that I'll be in the house. Another plans that got cancelled. It's four o'clock. She might come by 5 or 6 and we might go out anyway. Would I go? I haven't eaten and I don't want to. I think about telling her no. Wallow in my own misery, go to bed and change into pajamas and just cry my eyes out until I don't feel no more.

It's been almost since hours until the start of her shift. Two more hours and she will absolutely be out. They won't put her on overtime. But what if she's too tired? What if she has to return early? Why do I still feel like such an idiot? There's no way I could had known. Maybe it's best to postpone it until tomorrow. See her all day. Maybe she doesn't want to.

I feel like tuesday, when it was raining. We were supposed to go out and, as today, I showered and got ready. She returned from the United States and we talked about where would we meet or how could we do it. But it was out of our hands. The weather was horrible, the rain didn't stop, everything was filled with traffic. We would be returning late and it'd be dangerous.

And I felt something like this, a pain similar to the one that envelops me right now. I was all dressed up and ready. I wanted to go out, to get out of the house, feel like I do something, I have a life. And it was cancelled. I begged her, I proposed other ideas, maybe other places, somewhere closer. Please, anything.

She answered back and told me we could see a movie by her house. I took it like a homeless person accepts a roll of stale bread. Then, the next day I went to therapy, and since then I've been living in my own personal hell. I am trapped in this house. My father keeps calling me Ivan. I am drowning in here, I have no job, no goals, nothing. I have friends but I can't talk to them. I don't know how to approach them, what to say.

I saw yesterday's messages. She got out early and told me how she didn't had any signal and was waiting for the bus. It was three in the evening. Five hours after her in time.

I saw them and sent her some messages thinking she would answer them at any time. When I showered and changed, purposefully I didn't apply any make up. I put it on by three, thinking she could get out at any moment and I wanted to be ready, not lose any time.

I asked Anahi if she knew if Catherine was out already. The cellphone vibrated several times continuously. I, foolishly, thought how it might be a coincidence and Catherine just finally got signal. I was wrong. Anahi told me she got out by 1 in the afternoon and Catherine was still there. It was really busy because lots of people skipped. She didn't know if they'd make her work her full shift. In three minutes it's going to be 6 hours since she got in.

I don't know what I'm feeling. I am sad and angry and frustrated. I want to throw things and scream and keep crying. I don't know if I should finish cleaning up the make up that survived my tears or changed resignated into other clothes.

I think about sending her another text message, one telling her to contact me as soon as she cans, as if it would help in anyway to get out.

She does love me. She probably feels awful right now. She doesn't need my help to share this pain.

## 2016-09-26

I am home. Today I did go out. Catherine picked me up by 2, just like she said yesterday after coming from her job.

She send me a message after 5, closer to 6. In it she told me she was in San Ysidro but her phone was running out of battery, we would talk when she got home.

I sent her an audio later when I told her that I was going to ask her to come home, even if it were for a couple of minutes, just to see her, to hug her. I wanted to cry on her shoulder.The second one was for me to realize that she would not hear them until getting home, so not to bother to come. I understood.

When she got home, she said she felt she wanted to explode, she felt awful. She screamed to her mother when she asked about her time of arriving. She felt like crying. I said I had been crying all afternoon.

When she got home I decided to clean my face and then to change clothes. She told me her schedule for the next week. She'll work tuesday and Thursday. She wanted to make plans. I wanted to see her, but I was afraid of planning something to be cancelled.

Would I want to go somewhere? I wanted to be swallowed by my bed.

She change her mind and just told me. Tomorrow I'll be going to get my results, be ready and I'll pick you up by 2.

I wish I could be that direct and asertive. I can't, I wouldn't be able because she has plans and things to do. I don't.

And so I got up today in the morning. Nymeria is waking up later each day. This time she did not made a sound all night and just woke me up by 5.

I ate breakfast. My grandmother did two burritos for me and was preparing her own meal. She used the already heated pan to reheat them. We ate together. Nymeria had just eaten hers.

In the morning I did nothing. Catherine told me to start getting ready by noon. And so I did.

I showered and shaved both my legs and chest. I shaved again my face but just one pass. I did my hair and applied make up. Catherine told me not to wear pants but a dress. The white one would be perfect. She came and picked me up. Just in time after I gave Nymeria her food. We were playing in the living room with my grandma.

First we went to the building next to Rene's. There she picked up the results of her halter test. It was less than five minutes. We did more walking and getting to the floor than what we spent inside. Returning to the parking lot, we entered the AT&T place where she asked for info to change from Movistar.

I maybe will consider changing companies, too. It's 200 pesos each month, but I would have internet both here and in the United States.

From there we considered our options of what to do. We could eat teriyaki or ramen. There was both Plaza Rio and Playas. At first we decided to go to the teriyaki from playas where they serve us Miso soup and from there going to Argana.

When we parked in front of the place, she notices first how it was closed. What other options did we have? We could go to the sushi place in the harbor or there was a giuseppis close, too. She parked somewhere near the beach and we walked towards the other japanese place. Getting down the stairs a man told us to be careful because of the wind. Both of us were holding the skirts of our dresses. I turned and just smiled acknowledging him. Catherine hit my hand as a signal to not do that.

We got in thinking about ordering teriyaki. The last time we went was last year and I was wearing a dress as well. I ordered two pieces of sushimi, white raw fish over rice and a roll of tuna and salmon. Catherine ordered a yakimeshi and her soup. From there we walked in the beach. This was the first time that I stepped into the sea wearing a dress. The feeling was new and bizarre.

She took some pictures.

Before Argana we stopped by WalMart where she bought the mason jar with the S for me.

Argana was so hot that we change tables and sat outside. There was two women beside us and a group of three teenagers by the wall. She took me home. Nymeria is seated on my lap again. She was asleep most of the time that I wrote this.

## 2016-09-27

Nymeria is on my legs and standing on her back legs trying to reach the desk. I decided to put her down.

The same woman who appeared on the trans segment of the daily show with Trevor Noah is the protagonist of Her Story.

She's a waitress who's approached by a lesbian journalist doing a story on trans people. The short series is about 6 episodes no longer than 12 minutes. The first ones are close to seven and the last one is the longest.

Why did I choose to watch it? Where did I read about it? I had known before. It's not something new. I think it was yesterday in an article titled the series about trans people besides Transparent. I've never really been interested in watching that one. A trans woman of older age, parent of several grown children. Why does that make me uncomfortable? Was that my fear, growing old and realizing my whole life passed and spoiled.

I am not a young transitioner. I started hormone treatment in my twenties. I turned 23 the day I called to make the appointment of the endocrinologist. In my 21st birthday I wrote for the first time in the journal I was not a man. The feelings were not new in any sense, but it was the first time that I acknowledge them in any way.

David added me on Facebook, but he never really talked to me since my out post. He greeted me and started saying that he had a consultation.

He knows a 6 year old girl who was assigned male at birth. Her parents are taking it well according to him, but he wanted to check with me.

I am an expert. I might had not taken a master or specialty but I am confident I know about this more than some sexologists. I've been through this. I know about HRT and hormone blockers and the theories, but current and outdated. I studied psychology, I know how to do clinic interviews and psychotherapy and evaluations.

Why do I doubt myself?

Her parents are supporting, she goes to a private and including school. Her mother deals with the anxiety of telling her grandparents.

I answered his questions and gave him my opinion. I concluded telling him how I did not know the reference of an expert in the field but he could give them my contact if the wanted any kind of orientation or consult. He thanked me and said he gave it to them so they could fill me with their questions.

I think about how could it be, seeing them and answering their questions, seeing the girl and talking to her. They haven't even contacted me, possibly the won't and I still can't help but feel like an expert.

I am not ashamed of they knowing me, seeing me, of sharing my history and experience.

When I told Catherine my doubts about the difference with helping a stranger and my own sibling, she said it was obvious because of the closeness of the lather. And yet it doesn't really ease the tension of the thought.

Catherine worked today. Nymeria woke me and I fed her a little earlier than usual. I tried getting back to bed but I did not sleep much.

In the day I took my book with the intention of reading another chapter, finishing it and passing to a more formal and useful one. I didn't even open it.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. I have things to talk about. I felt sad and miserable this past week. I did not call Yolanda nor updated my resume. I felt trapped in my home and in my situation, the frustration and impotence are like a pool full of water that barely covers my head and my feet are tied to lead. I am heavy and can't jump. I can see the surface, I know it's close, just a jump ahead but still unreachable. There is no way to swim nor float. Time is running out and I'm drowning.

Catherine changed company of mobile. Tomorrow she might come home and play with Nymeria for a while. I want her here, close, with me. I want her to hug me and caress me and care for me just like I care for Nymi.

Penelope just started in Spotify. A couple of days ago Chevo posted in Facebook "And her little eyes full of yesterday" I recognized the lyrics and wondered if Monica would too. I commented how that song makes me cry.

"Somebody ruined it for me" I thought about writing.

Did she? I feel melancholy when I hear it, but isn't that the point?

Who would be Penelope? I or she?

Monica Gonzalez's 23rd birthday, Tomorrow

Why does my machine think I care about the date? I deleted her from my phone and everywhere, or so I thought. I did think about yesterday. Had it passed? Yesteryear I wondered about congratulating her or something.

"Thanks", was her answer. This time there is no doubt about what I'll do. I'll just try to forget about it.

I am trapped. I am trapped in a history, and in this house and in a foreign name. I've always hated the narrative of a woman trapped in a man's body. I reject it . And yet being caged is my whole penance now.

I had read how a person commented how the procedure of changing the name and gender marker was exclusive for the people who were born in the capital. For a moment I was scared, petrified. What if it were true? I would never be able to get out, because of something totally out of my control.

Later another one posted how it wasn't true. You don't have to be born there, but you do need to have a way of prove your residence.

Today was a kick in the gut. Wednesdays are the days which I am sure of going out. I know for a fact that I'll get out of the house and I'll see the world and walk its streets and have a place to be and someone to see. This week I needed therapy, I needed to talk.

Moments before I would get up from the couch to get ready my grandma mentioned how there was no water. Nobody said anything, there was no mention of it on the news nor the internet. We were not prepared, there wasn't even water in the gallons. I had no way of getting ready. My hair was a mess, how could I put make up on my face? How could I get out of the house without shaving?

I decided to cancel the appointment. Even knowing that Rene might charge me for the missed session, I decided to.

Catherine and I had the plan of meeting today. She'd come home and play a while with Nymeria. Was it cancelled? We said nothing about it. Catherine would go out to meet Jessica so she could borrow her a book of psychology for a class of her brother. I returned to bed with tears in my eyes and disappointment deep in my hearth. I slept for no more than an hour. When I got up, 30 minutes before the time of my appointment, I realized the water had returned.

Should I shower? Maybe Catherine could come, anyway. She'd be out of her house. I wanted, needed her. I told her.

I climbed the stairs to the bathroom, and Nymeria, being left alone, followed me the whole flight. I took a picture of her on my lap and climbing my chest. "Come visit us, don't say no to this cutie... I need you"

She told me how she hadn't said anything home. She wanted to stay, she hadn't said anything about this saturday nor monday either.
I could go to her house, though. I told her no. Why did I? I was upset, annoyed and angered. I have nowhere to go and nobody to see. I feel lonelier than ever. I had to cancel, again, another plan. My therapy session, somewhere where I could talk about all of the reasons that keep me in bed and in tears. And she threw it to my face. She didn't want to go because she had other plans later. She has to go this weekend for her paycheck of her job and monday, when she'll go to a theme park.

I slept most of the day. We talked about it in the evening. I said how I felt and she apologized. I cancelled, too, the plans for saturday. I don't have many dollars and I need the money. She invited me this Friday to go out for breakfast. I didn't know. It'd be cheap, I could be out and seen. She said she'd go out in the night and I told her no.

Nymeria woke in a scream. I turned to see and she started shaking and trembling. I brought her to my lap. I care for her, I love her. I'm caressing her trying to calm her. "What is it, Nymi? It's ok, it was a dream. It's ok, darling. It's ok"

I am not alone. I have her. That's the reason I wanted her, didn't I?

## 2016-09-29

Catherine is on her way home. Tomorrow she'll work as well. She read her schedule wrong. She's in by 8 so her out time would be somewhere around one or two. She asked me to accompany her home tomorrow and stay to watch movies or something. She wants to cry. She completed a full shift of 8 hours today.

Last night I told her how I felt. I was upset but there was a deep sadness buried in my chest. "Sofia... I love you", she sent me before falling asleep. "I love you very much, too". A couple of minutes I sent her another text: "I am in so much pain".

"Sofi, do I make you feel alone?" she replied back in the early morning before I was woken up by the cries of Nymeria. It's not her, not really, but I do feel lonelier than ever. It's being here, and having nothing to do but wait. Just a day before the start of October. I did not even started drafting the story to send to the contests of sexuality tales. I've written a quarter of a thousand pages daily for months but I haven't started a project that supposedly I feel passionate about.

Tomorrow is the last day of September, a day before the third to last month of the year, a month before the start of the application process. I am not sure still about which master program to apply. Today is my ex's birthday. It does have its benefits not having her on Facebook. I won't stumble on our friends' congratulations nor will I give a thought about the number of people compared to mine, nor will I try to suppress any thoughts crossing my mind after reading the nauseous messages of her partner.

Yesterday I shared my thoughts of my mother having her still on her friend list and the possibility of her being one of the people who would send a message.

"Besides them being friends, how do you feel about it? That tomorrow is her birthday?"

I told her how it was different to last year in the sense that there is no doubt or worry about what to do or not to do. This time it's obvious. I feel anger and resentment still. I don't know really why or how to stop.

I read something about holding a grudge. It's a way that I keep her in my mind and thoughts when she has moved on. I'll never be free if I don't let her go and forgive her. In her mind I'm the one who does not deserve forgiveness. Does it mean that I'm in her mind and thoughts as well?

Has she received the box? Did she throw the stuff I gave her? What of those would I care to get back? I remembered in the wedding about the Seville handcrafted fan. She never gave me the francs. Does she keep the fridge magnets?

I did love her.

For the first time I can really write without any doubt that I don't anymore.

It's not like I lied to Catherine when I told her that I would never return to Monica's side, or that I didn't want to.

I think of her and remember our memories and recall the video I made and I just feel nothing. I am happy with Catherine. I cherish our memories, even now that I was upset just yesterday with her, I think back to when I juggled the decision of whom I wanted to be with.

I picked Catherine. I almost lost her. She was close to cut her ties with me, stop looking for me, to let me go, when I reached out and we reconnected. I, honestly, don't know where would I be today without her.

In the bathroom I remembered about a skype conversation with Monica before her October's departure. She was already in her relationship. She started to change clothes and undressed herself in front of the camera. Was it her blouse or pants? I saw her underwear and was not excited. I felt uncomfortable. "Don't you have a boyfriend?... Do you expect me to go there?... I won't..."

She put her clothes on and made no comment. Had she any intention? Why do I think about it? Would it change anything? Just as she could not think of me in the last months, she might struggle with the idea of liking me. But it changes absolutely nothing.

I answered Jessica's message asking for the textbooks. I invited her home and she accepted. I showered but stayed in pajamas. She came and I let her in. She knows where I live. She's seen my house.

Catherine will be home soon. Nymeria is asleep between my feet.

## 2016-09-30

I have a headache and not much intentions of writing and finishing the words. Nymeria is biting the lining of my boxspring under the bed. I cam home and cleaned the shit and urine outside of the mat. I fed her and she almost shat again on the same place. Nymeria now is quiet after barking at me because I didn't let her bite anymore.

Catherine is on the other window, in the chat of whatsapp.

I dreamed today with Monica. She was in a car with me. I don't remember the reason why but she was looking at my breasts, as if she were measuring them. She told me, in a manner of conclusion, how I could use certain kind of bra. There was a conversation that I've already forgotten. It ended with me saying no and then she ending with a bye. Was she proposing something? Her closure was the same of mine. No, I replied to her "don't look for me anymore ... you behaved like an asshole" with an OK.

After her departure in my dream. It was something like a ghost leaving, maybe a reference to the phantom I used to mention? Or like the scene in HIMYM when Ted lets Robin go as a balloon, but less melodramatic.

I tried to sleep after feeding Nymeria but it was all for naught. I stepped out of the kitchen and noticed a plate with two separate eggs, one was over easy and the other scrambled. It was covered with a napkin. In the pan, there were fried tortillas scrambled with eggs and chile. I returned to my room realizing that being 7 in the morning my mother hadn't left for school yet.

Luis stayed home because the teachers had some kind of conference or meeting. My mother didn't have classes anyway, but that workshop.

Nymeria, after being reprimanded, went straight to her bed and stayed inside. It's funny how I can see the reactions and emotions in her. How, after screaming or calling her attention, she barks back as answering back. Her anger and tainting me pretending to come bite my toes. Then, after not backing down, she resigns and retracts in shame, lowering herself submissive and going to her bed.

Just now she exited. She's here by my feet were she lay down. In this instant she put her head on top of me foot. I love her. I have what I envied of Catherine with MuÃ±eca.

Catherine went to work since the early morning. We had said that maybe I could go to her house today, watch some movies or something. We decided not to agree on anything because it wasn't sure. Today's shift was open-ended like last week's. I didn't want to repeat that occurrence. She did work her 8 hours. I asked her if she wanted me to go anyway. I was still in my pajamas and in the couch. I had not eaten since noon. Nonetheless what I had eaten until then was plenty.

Something in me didn't want to go. I would need to shower and shave and do my hair and make up, just for a couple of hours of being in her house. What is it with me about wanting to be seen? I want to be noticed and validated. I don't want to stay home or go to somewhere where everybody knows me. I want to face strangers and meet their reactions to me. I want to be addressed in some kind of way, see how people see me.

I asked her if she was sure. She let me decide. I ended up going. I showered leaving Nymeria in my room. I put on shorts and a tank top. I gave her her third meal and left. I parked the car and noticed two old men outside the mom and pop shop across the street from her house. One of them was Cathy's grandpa. Would he recognize me? I noticed both of their sights on me and saw their lips move as their eyes were fixated on me parking. How would he see me? As Catherine's boyfriend? Or Catherine's girl friend that stayed the other day.

Catherine met me on her porch and told me to move the car. I had parked it in front of her house, away from the men. I moved and they saw me. He told me how it was dangerous because of the big trucks and buses that sometimes pass.

We ate chinese food and watched the first episode of Luke Cage. The first minutes of Cloud Atlas and the series Her Story. We kissed on her couch and talked.

I liked today. I love her and love seeing her. She had her first paycheck today.

## 2016-10-01

Nymeria is on the floor. She's still with her fore legs on mine although she has just fallen from my lap. I've returned from Catherine's car outside the private. This time we didn't go out, nor she brought me home from her house. I accompanied her outside after spending the afternoon here. We were talking about Mexico. I opened up, "I'm nervous about everything that's ahead". What can I do? How can I do it? I showed her the status before when we were in the couch. Someone posted in Reddit if it counted as discrimination when he was denied information about an apartment because the building was a "family place", of mom, dad and children. He referred as his Significant Other as partner instead of girlfriend, so he assumed that the landlord took the presupposed sexual orientation as the cause of denial.

If being gay was cause enough of being denied. What would happen with me, someone who is trans. A "man" who thinks is a woman. A freak that looks like a girl but has a boy's name in her papers.

Catherine's response was just a frown. There was nothing else to say.

In her car, I explained how it wasn't just that. I'd have to be accepted to the master program, then finding somewhere to live and the whole process of changing the id, as Ivan still. After that could I start with the whole process of the name in the birth certificate and then the id again and the CURP and the papers in the university and everything else.

She said that I'm taking everything at once. One step at a time, she proposed, posing her hand upon my thigh.

Looking for a place to live is the first place. The master program? What if I'm denied? What if they refuse my entrance because I'm trans?

What will I do if I don't even get to the program? How can I stay here, where I can't change anything, where I don't dare to look for a job, where I'm trapped in an arrested development. I cried in desperation in her car. It was the realization of the words I said in the discussion of early today.

We talked about going to the United States, maybe going to In N Out. She invited Anahi. Everything was set until she started calculating the money needed for transportation and gasoline and parking. She was almost touching the red figures. We cancelled and she concluded with a "I was already excited about today. It's like I'm getting up again just to be thrown back."

"Tell me about it", this has been my last weeks. "I feel mine and yours".

There was something in those words that made me lose it. I did not scream nor insult her. I said no more than three words, and yet those were enough:

"I doubt it"

"Wey, I try looking for the chance of going out with you and I see how you get when I have to cancel you again. I feel guilt. I know you feel bad. I know what it is to feel trapped."

"But I don't feel bad because I won't go out today. You can ask money to your dad. It can even be borrowed, and there, your problems are solved for two weeks. There's going to be a mass for my uncle in Orange and here they're talking about going. We would need to get permits, and that would mean that I'd have to dress as a man and pretend I'm still studying.

You can get your permit and take the driver's test and in two weeks have your license and avoid the spending on transport and parking. I can do nothing to change my name.

Don't tell me you fell both yours and mine."

"I know, I'm ridiculous."

I did not know if she was serious. In my last relationship that could be a sarcastic statement, an exaggeration trying to undermine my point. Was she really thinking she was ridiculous? I don't think her problems mean nothing. But it was the pain of being in front of her issues with the two hundred dollars she received in her paycheck when I don't even have a job.

"I feel you put me aside... You feel nobody can understand, ok, maybe it's true. Maybe I won't get to understand you. I've been here, some years now, by your side. Every step ahead and back I've been here. I'm glad when you're happy, and it hurts me when you're sad. I've seen you beautiful and radiant like in my parents' wedding and I've seen you in your worst when you're crying on my shoulder.

And it hurt me that you underestimate my feeling respecting you and me.

...Can I go to your house?"

We watched Netflix. The first episode of Rick and Morty and the second episode of Luke Cage. We ate meat and tostitos with fruit. We played with my dog.

I love her. Why do I keep trying to hurt the people I love?



## 2016-10-02

I almost forgot to write today's words. I was just coming to my room after watching TV lying on the couch. Nymeria was resting on her flower by my side. I called her to come to bed and asked Luis to turn the lights. I was just about to get onto it, when I saw the computer and remembered.

I don't have the energy. It's weird. This is supposed to help me. These words are an outlet that let me get the feelings out of my chest and unload all thoughts and sorrows that haunt me and cloud my day. Writing here is almost the same as what I do in Rene's office. The blank page can't reply to my discourse. The screen won't reply with an answer or an intervention that will make me see everything from a different perspective.

Last week I did not make it to Rene's. I feel as if I were to see him tomorrow. I won't. It's Sunday.

Yesterday, while Catherine was here, I received a call. I reviewed the first numbers to check for the origin of the caller. In a couple of rings, the in app I have let me know that it was the veterinary. The caller confirmed the place and told me their records show that my pet had an appointment for a vaccine.

This is Mrs Sofia, right?

Was my voice not convincing? Was he just confirming?

Wednesday I'll see Rene and will be able to say to him all the things that have happened. The several times that Catherine had to cancel. The ideas of uselessness and ineptitude that fill me with self-loathing. I feel alone. I feel miserable. I feel frustrated and trapped.

Yesterday in Catherine's car I shared with her some of my anxiety. There are lots of steps and things to do. I can't do none of them yet. I can't even start.

Today I got up and almost begged Nymeria to stay in bed. I feel tired, exhausted. Remembering that my days are empty just makes it worse. I ate my breakfast and took my pills. I haven't refilled the dispenser. I know one of the medications will run out this week. Will I buy them or will ask my mom for help?

Nymeria just left my feet and got herself to her box.

What was it that made me cry today? What was the reason now?

Gabriela shared a post on her Facebook. She placed a heart stating support for the idea in the pictures. "The closet is for clothes" was the name of the page that posted originally. I am not subscribed to it but I am familiar with its nature. It's one of those pages of LGBT support. The pictures followed the same theme: "Not all women..." Not all of them... us? ...

Not all women are skinny, not all women are feminine, not all women shave.

Not all women have a vagina.

I know better than to read the comments. It's not the first time that I see and read the ignorant and hateful and dismissive thoughts of the people. I am not unfamiliar with what most, no, several people might think of people like me.

It being a support place, an lgbt place threw me guard.

The same arguments. How is not natural, how they... we are sick. Men confused or who want to be woman. Feeling like a helicopter, like an animal, like being taller, like being of other race... Woman are born that way. Chromosomes are unchangeable. Why don't we accept our bodies like they are? We are just perpetuating gender stereotypes.

And then, the most hurtful. I can take the hateful people, the religious or ignorant. But these ones, these who state first how they accept us, we should be able to do whatever we want or wear or look as we desire... but we're not men nor women. We are trans, not women. We'll never be women. We're different.

We're people, but not like them.

We're not really people. We're less. We're thrash and worthless.

And then I think, what does it matter changing my name in a piece of paper? What use will there be for getting a fixed birth certificate and changing my documents? Why do I want it? Will it make me more of a woman?

No. It will just help me hide myself. I don't want to fix the papers and documents so everything's in line. I want them so I can shut up and hide this part of me. I want to erase Ivan and not having to mention that history or let anyone know...

That's why it hurts so much that there are several steps even before starting with the procedure.

It doesn't matter that I move to a foreign city. I'll have to take a new id there and let them know I'm trans. When I find a place, the tenants will have to know and be ok with me being trans. The university will know my past and nature and will have to accept me anyway. My neighbors will probably now, my potential grad school mates and teachers.

Everyone will know. I'll be visible, exposed. It'll be the same as here. Except I'll be alone and vulnerable.

## 2016-10-03

"Sofia Way"marks the souvenir that Catherine holds in the picture she just sent me.

She has returned from her trip to Six Flags. I could not get up in the morning. I fed Nymeria by seven as I usually do. My mother hadn't left still. We both returned to bed. I felt tired. There are fractures of snaps of the dream I awoke from.

"You will hate me after not buying it for you"

No, of course not. Nymeria is playing at the back of my chair. She's so young. Three months ago she didn't even exist. Even when I posted my secret online and came out to the world she wasn't even born yet. Two days after that she came to the world. A month later would I go to Mexicali and meet her. Two more weeks later would she come. And here she is. She's not my first pet, but it's the first one that I really care about.

Why can't I take the thought of her leaving out of my head? I see her running and playing, I hear the little bell on her collar and feel the warmth of her white fur brushing my legs as she pass by. Will I miss those things when she'll be gone? Will she go in years? Months? Just today did I start to thing about December.

For a lot I was afraid and nervous about how would Christmas be. Would my relatives behave strangely? How would I feel, how would I dress and present?

I've been to Mexicali, I've presented myself to them and everything was alright. I have nothing to worry about in that sense. How about Nymeria? Will I leave her her? Will we take her with us? Catherine said that by then she might take care of her for me those days. So sure, I might have a solution. In the vet clinic there is a service of sitting, as well.

But, what about months later, when I, hopefully, leave for the capital? Will she stay? Will she miss me as MuÃ±eca would miss Catherine?

At the same time I want her to both miss me and not. I don't want her to suffer, but I love the idea about somebody caring that much for me. I thought It would be awkward or uncomfortable when they refer to me as her mother, and yet, I feel this weirdly tingle inside.

I was nervous at the beginning of the day. I showered at noon and prepared everything before leaving and taking her to her appointment with the veterinary. They had called me in the weekend.

I usually feel bad because of having nothing to do, and yet, today that I had plans, they made me nervous and uncomfortable. Like the last time I took her, a strange anxiety accompanied me the whole way there. It was as if it were me the one who was going to be pricked.

I brought her to my lap, She's resting between cries. Maybe she wants off. I'm putting her down. She has gone to her bed and jumped over the t-shirt I placed in there for her. Her head lies over the little dog Luis gave her. She was tired.

I told Catherine just now not to wait for me. She was up before dawn. An hour ago she got to her house.She went to Six flags with Anahi, Anahi's cousin and Xennia. It was weird seeing the picture of Catherine and Xennia by Batman sides. The have some faint resemblance. I was just a child and I liked Xennia. What did I see in her.

In jr high, I was infatuated with her. It was a childish fixation. I knew her since we both were fours years old. I saw her. Did the thought of seeing her as my double ever crossed my mind? We looked nothing alike, and yet I saw us similarly. Later Jessica would take her place. She was my "sister". Jessica wanted me, she kissed me once and I never reciprocated.

I remember the fantasies where I put myself in their places.

In elementary school, maybe the last year, there was a time when we always were together. We exchanged my tamagotchi. Every time the professor asked us to group by pairs, we would end up together.

And then I did something, I said something or asked for something or confessed something, and we went apart. We stopped talking. It was as if we didn't know each other.

Did I felt then what I feel now with Monica?

I used to fantasize how years later would we reunite and we'd be so much different and grown. And I see her now in that picture with Catherine, my girlfriend, and I look at Xennia and I see nothing but past and stories yesteryears.

Will it ever come a time when I will feel the same way when I stumble upon a Monica's picture?

## 2016-10-04

The days keep running. Today is October fourth. When was it that I checked the updates of the feeds of webcomics? Was it more than three days ago?

Nymeria is running around like mad. Maybe it's just a rush of energy. Earlier I took my phone and looked the pictures from when I met her, the time when she was just a little puppy. She's grown so much. She barks and runs and comes to me when I call her.

Tomorrow I'll see Catherine and I'll see Rene. 1pm, I think, is when I have the appointment. A week ago I ought to cancel because the water was out. I could not shower and I dared not to go out. Will I talk about it? What if he charges me the lost consult? I've never had to pay him double before. There was just another time that I cancelled less than 24 hours from our appointment.

It was a Thursday, or was it Wednesday? It was when we went to the Mental Hospital in the early morning to take our class there. After the class I would return home and have a couple hours until getting to therapy. This time I was giving a ride to Catherine and Anahi. We saw Marlene drive past us. I made some stupid joke about defending my manliness, so I stepped on the gas to catch up with her. Now, in hindsight, the comment is kind of ironic.

Talking and playing I did not notice the warnings about the bump. No, it was not a bump, the opposite of that. The front tires fell and the hit made the car jump. We all were fine. There was no damage but a broken hose of the radiator. The anti-freeze fluid spilt all under. When I stopped after having smoke come out of the hood, the first thing I did was to call Rene.

I told him I would not be able to get there. I think I said nothing about the crash. Maybe I did. It wasn't until I set that, that I called my father for help.

Catherine will go to the dr tomorrow. She told me that she'd pick me up in the early morning. She hasn't gotten out of her shift. It was 7, I guess, when she got out on her thirty minute break. She will pick me later in the morning. She can go fix the problem of her phone service while I am in session.

Have I thought what will I talked with Rene? I try to recall the issues with the last weeks and I came upon a wall.

I've been feeling alone and inept. I've been fighting with these thoughts and emotions that bring me down.

Is this depression? Is this dysphoria? Is this just a shitty time?

I've been watching South Park. Someone from Telnor called today to give some information about this new service they're offering. He talked about this new number of emergency and my mind ran to the new 911. He addressed me since the very beginning of the call as miss. At first I thought it would be like any of those other calls that they give their information and just hang up.

This time no, he said the number and asked me to confirm it. He asked the relation I have to Jose Luis, the titular of the line. I said I was his daughter. I gave him my full name. When he asked I said Sofia Fernandez. When he asked for the second last name, a sudden rush of anxiety flashed through my spine. What if it was official, what if somehow he realizes I am lying?

Am I lying? Is this why I feel desperation to change the papers? I hate the sensation that my name is a lie, that is not mine.

But it's not. It's not official.

Catherine had to cancel last week, it was Sunday. Did we go out last weekend? What did I do the weekend?

Why is it so hard to remember?

I don't think I'll be writing the short story for the contest. When I read the poster I thought about sending several and I've written none.

I haven't updated the resume. I thought about writing the actual one with my name but I can't. I have to put the official one, the one they'll know me by in the application process.

Lots of things to go through, lots of steps. High, difficult and painful steps.

Will freedom finally come after everything?

## 2016-10-05

I'll start the words early. I'm in the living room seeing Nymeria biting and pushing her flower pillow around. Is she playing or is she just as frustrated as I am?

We didn't agree on a plan yesterday. Catherine went to sleep and I watched some episodes of South Park in the tablet. I remember fragments of the dreams that intercepted the flashes of consciousness in the middle of the night. It had been long since I dreamed as a man with no mention or thought about being trans. There was something about a school. In most of my late dreams the concurrent theme is that I'm a grown student still in school. In this one my voice was deep and the trying of speaking was tiring on its own.

Something about a teacher or a test and its grades. Later something chaotic happened. A storm, maybe? I went out and found Jessica, Chevo's Jessica. I got into the other building and met my "friend". Except it wasn't Eusebio. Sergio. From where is that name? Did his face match the person I know? I haven't known of him in years. Does he know of me? The last time I saw him I was walking with Monica by my side and wanted to be recognized because of the pride I felt having her by my side.

He finished or is studying Graphic design. He went to a summer abroad in Prague. He learned english in Canada. Why did I dream about him?

I talked with Catherine when my alarm sang. It was early. She hadn't gotten up either. Could we postpone? Maybe she could pick me up later. I felt an uneasy feeling, like a premonition of another cancellation.

We didn't cancel. She did pick me up. In fact she was waiting outside when I got out of the bathroom. We went to AT&T near the River Plaza.

I got distracted seeing the site of renting and roommates from the DF. There are several options with a huge range of prices, from the cheaper ones at two thousand to the more expensive ones near the ten K.

That's the reason I returned early. From the plaza near the cell center, she drove us to the sam's one. Where she park was closer to the booths than the stairs. I got down and remembered the time when I got my first kiss. I decided to not mention anything. We walked to Rene's. He didn't charge me the missed session. He asked me to enter early.

The session was hard. I cried most of it. I'm desperate and frustrated. My plans are founded on clouds. What if I don't get to the university? Why don't I move earlier than the application process? My parents will help me anyway, won't they? Do I count on them for helping me? I remember my father comment of how he would not maintain me on another city.

Will I be alone? I counted on Catherine, I was afraid of her not getting in and letting me go. Now, if I go earlier, what would happen?

It was a hard session. I got out with more doubts than the ones I got in. He told me to actually have plans, not see them far away. What if I don't get in? When will I go?

What other options besides the capital do I have?

I can ask for asylum in Canada. I might marry Catherine and fix the papers. No. Catherine would not marry me. Is that why I had that faint but dangerous feeling that I can't count on her?

It's unfair to expect her to marry me. I love her, she does love me.

Could, should I look for a job? Should I send the so thought e-mail to the SER NGO that gives trans care? Can I ask them for a job or a volunteer option?

I thought again about the course, the MMPI course that I considered giving. I have the worksheet. I've graded it. I know it.

Would people really be interested to take it? How much can I charge?

Looking at the renting site gave me a short-lived peace of mind. There are postings cheap enough to be practical. I read the bio of the ones offering and there is even an option for looking to rooms that are welcome to LGBT people.

Still, I didn't get to mention it in session, but I just remembered that even in the LGBT community, I might not be totally welcome.

Where, where in this world will I ever be?

## 2016-10-06

I am afraid I'm having suicide ideation again.

I got up to feed the dog and feel this imminent and heavy load on top of my chest. I returned to bed and tried to sleep again. Lately she's been easier to stay in bed after urinating and, sometimes, pooping. I got up not much later knowing that I won't be falling asleep easily if I stay in bed. Catherine would enter after noon. In the morning she got ready.

After seeing the renting site yesterday I stayed with the idea of the city and the possibilities of going and surviving. I looked at a job sites, it was just the intention of knowing the job market and situation in there. Are there much of offerings for people in my field? Are there some research positions? Human resources? Psychologists?

I had the price ranges of the site in mind when looking the salaries. My mood took a dive. I was falling non-stop to the dark pit that I used to call home.

Was Catherine out already of her shift when we talked? I just mentioned how I was seeing the job offerings and feel inept when seeing that the experience I have doesn't fit to what they're looking for. I searched for CV templates so I can finally upgrade mine. There is no point in putting my name in the applications if none of my papers are changed. The university one, too, will have to be named under my legal name.

It's like a short chain that keeps my hands tied to my feet. I can't move and my back is aching.

I need to change my name to apply for a job, but I need to move the capital to change my name, but I need a job to move to the capital.

Catherine's support was disheartening.

"Didn't you make the little chicken, son?", I ignored her. I just heard the word and stayed quiet and continuing writing. She called my attention calling me Sofi. Catherine told me before how I could say something, correct them. What's the point?

I told her before entering her shift that I was stressed and tired. She asked me if I knew the reason. Of course I know. When does it lessens? Since yesterday, never. It's been a continuing curve of distress and worry. I am afraid. I feel hopeless.

I told her how It's so real now. I will have to endure it all by myself.

"You don't know that"
"I don't know what?"
"Well... Nevermid"
"You're entering now... I'm afraid of ending whoring myself"
"I thought that to the master we would go together, but yesterday you were thinking of leaving January. You won't end up doing it"

Then she got in and four hours later got out.

I am sitting down after looking for Nymeria. A lump is stuck in my throat and my eyes start to water. It's like my heart is slowing down and skipping beats. Every heartbeat hurts and is stronger than the last.

She asked me if I would consider working in a call center. Would I? Would I really? I doubt it and the mere thought stabbed me like a dagger. She mostly focused and talking with my parents. Actually consulting them on what could happen, if they would support me.

Yesterday thinking about telling her about my dad almost made me cry again outside Rene's. How can I ask my dad for support when he directly told me No six years ago? Would it be validating his fears letting him know that I am not able to ask for a job interview in my situation?

"I know telling yo to start working is too much, I know you would have to do it as Ivan"
"Then why are you doing it?

I almost begged her to stop. I couldn't take it.

"Because if you start to work you would start to solve plans", she kept on with an audio and more messages.

"...I don't know what else to tell you"

"Don't say anything, don't talk to me"

She sent another audio. "Really?... Ok"

"You're not helping me. You're making me feel worse. I'd rather die than go back to be Ivan for another six months."

I don't know what to do. I don't know if I can take it. I am scared. I can't do it. It's too much, I am not alone, but why don't I feel otherwise? Why is it so hard for me to ask for help?

Do I? Do I really prefer to die?

Will that be the only option before being homeless and turning to prostitution?

## 2016-10-07

What is it of these last days? I did not send the e-mail to the editor who asked for freelancer writers.

I had the pictures of the contact of the recruiters for the call centers. Last night, when I was in bed I could not fall asleep. I kept thinking about the courses I could offer. I know the supplement scales, and I have the spreadsheet to grade them. I know other tests that they don't teach in the university. The inventory on anxiety, the one of self-perception... When I thought about them an idea came to my head. I could post on the group of the university how when grading an MMPI manually I made myself a spreadsheet to save me from using the transparencies. Would that be something they'd be interesting in buying? The spreadsheet alone would be almost incomprehensible. But maybe they'd be interested, in a coursework? Those scales are not seen in the university.

How many of them would take the course? I could get an idea of the number of people that might take it. I thought about checking the capacity of the conference room in Cupsi. After another hour of turning in the sheets I grabbed my phone and logged into the site. There is an advert promoting the services of Cynthia. Several hours were taken. When I tried looking for the big one, I could not find it. It's not offered anymore. And then, the plan I had, the solution that I could follow instead of resigning to look for a temporal job and another months hiding in the rotten persona that is Ivan, was over.

What else could I do? In what other way could I offer it?

It's been hours since I started and I am not even by half.

Was it after or before the realization that I thought about the pitches I could offer the editor? It was before. I asked Catherine if she thought I was weak, vulnerable. I told her how I couldn't help but wonder why would anybody read what I can say.

"From everyone our age, you are the smartest person I know. I love what you write, for school and yourself."

What were the ideas? I could write about my own experience, personal and intimate essays. Or I could write about more technical and informative topics.

The first pride I went to, all the process from crossing the border in boy mode, to putting on feminine clothes for the first time outside, to getting to the actual parade, the break of silence in honor of the fallen trans brothers and sisters who have ended their lives, to the culmination of pride, the acceptance of knowing that who I am is something to be proud of.

I could talk about the stages of coming out, first to myself, to my partner soon to be ex, to my closest friends, to my mom, to my family and finally to the world.

I thought how writing about those things and putting my name on those could not be a perfectly good idea. Do I really want my personal information online? Something as private as talking about the first time I wore feminine clothes outside a hotel room, or how I told my love ones that I was trans.

The other subjects I could talk about, more impersonal, less dangerous to publish, could be talking about the difference between dysphoria and dysmorphia. How being transgender is not the same thing as being delusional or dysmorphic, the difference between wanting to cut off an arm to a penis. The double dysphoria, how depression and dysphoria might go hand in hand and worsen each other off. The pros and cons of Informed Consent and the Gatekeeping of the formal route.

Somewhen after those thoughts I fell asleep. Did I dream something? Was this night when I dreamed again of my ex? Another reunion and truce? Coming out of the dream but still in another one, I thought how it would be impossible to talk, to mention it, to ask.

I read today, another chapter of the book that I can't seem to finish.

Catherine has her permit now. She went to do her test and passed it on her first try. I opened the files of the resumes but have not written anything on anyone. Tomorrow we might go the United States. In the evening we will go to the reunion in Paola's house. A six of beers and bag of chips.

Andrea will be invited, will she say something?


## 2016-10-09

Yesterday I cheated. I maybe could had done them, but decided not to. The last plan was that Catherine would come pick me up and we would return in her car or I could take a uber if I'd prefer to stay.

Word is almost out of its license term. We were going to go to the United States to buy a new yearly license and other stuff. My dad didn't buy breakfast. I got up early and showered after him. My mother and my father renewed the license online. My mother decided to stay home with my grandma and Nymeria. My brothers and father crossed the border. It was a little uncomfortable going on the copilot seat. My father didn't addressed me in the old name or used masculine pronouns. My fingernails were painted red and my clothes were feminine. When I got out of the house my mother asked me if I were not going to paint my mouth. My lips were already painted in the light color.

I didn't want to correct her. The crossing border patrol made no questions or comments about me or my appearance. He asked were would we be going and doing and he let us go.

Where did we go from there? We ate at Denny's. When we got there we were seated by someone who wasn't serving. Was he a manager? He had this earpiece and was busy doing some other things. The waitresses were busy with other tables and we were left ignored. Was it because of me?

Finally a busboy came and said he could take the order of our drinks while a waitress got free. He spoke in spanish. When he turned from my father to me, he stopped himself mid-word. Was he going to say sir? Was he going to say miss? His face was of surprise. Not much time later the waitress return and asked us again.

We went to Target and I bought several things. From a plate and food for Nymeria to a bralette and a hoodie. I bought a blouse, a long tunic but it's too big. I look like a child wearing her parent's clothes.

We went to a Hot Topic store and a Best buy. It was fun being with my brothers, the three of us teasing and laughing. I asked Luis about how he was going to buy a purse, and why he didn't take it. He said my father told him people would make fun of him, mock him for wearing it. He said it should not matter, he has the right to wear or use whatever he wants. And everybody respects him anyway because he can solve a rubik's cube.

We stopped by Taco Bell, before coming home.

I showed Catherine what I bought. She said she was uncomfortable thinking about her clothes. She wanted to go but skip all about getting ready.

I changed clothes and was unsure about what to wear. It wasn't cold enough but it wasn't that hot either. I wanted to look feminine, Andrea and her boyfriend had not seen me after I came out publicly. I was nervous about them, their comments, their reactions.

I felt I could not ask for Catherine's help. I was ready so I offered Catherine to pick her up and return in uber, like we had planned before. She said yes so I had no time to finish the words. We were on our way home in the Freeway when in the group conversation Paola asked if someone could pick her up. I told Catherine to offer her a ride.

She accepted and we all stopped in a Calimax in my neighborhood. We bought beer and chips. She grabbed a bottle of Black Tears for Chevo.

Before leaving the house I asked my dad to move the Pick up. I had first told him how Catherine would pick me up so he was a little confused. I explained I'd be bringing her here and we would take an uber. "Or could you give us a ride?"

He agreed.

Catherine told Paola that he would fear my Dad. He's intimidating and looks angry.

He greeted them and we put our stuff in the back. He drove us and left us in Paola's house. He asked me if I would want him to pick me up, but I said no. He waited for us to enter the house and then left.

Andrea and Rafa were already there.

"It's been a lot since the last time I see you" she told Catherine when she hugged her. "well, the two of you", she completed when she saw me in the neutral masculine way.

It was... hard. When they later referred to me as Ivan, it confirmed my anxiety. I was worried they'd be doing it all night. I felt self-conscious. Didn't I look different enough? Was I too manly?

Luckily, after everyone kept talking about me in the feminine and by my name, they caught up. When Paola's boyfriend came, no one said anything about me. Paola introduced me as Sofia. He greeted me by a kiss in the cheek. Does he know? Does Paola's sister?

Was my voice not too obvious?

We smoked hookah and drank. We played beer pong and Fuck you and a game Chevo introduced which you had to put a table tennis ball into a cup before the other cup came to you. We had lots of fun.

Paola is officially in a relationship now. I felt more attached to everyone of them. I remember when we all hang out in the university I could not get this feeling away of being two groups of friends interacting. I sat beside Paola and she called my name and hit me in the leg when I teased her.

Paola was the first one to leave. Then Andrea and her fiance. They said good bye using my name and he even kissed my cheek.

A little after two in the morning we left. There was an issue with the uber. He waited for us in the other street.

Paola used my phone to set it all right.

He picked us up and took me home. She got to hers not much later.

I dreamed with Paola. Maybe the sudden feeling of closeness was a thought that stayed in my mind when I fell to sleep. I put on my pajamas and lied down while Catherine went to her room. I put Nymeria on my legs, we both were falling asleep. She was awake in her box when I got into my room.

A couple hours later I saw her walking on my side in the bed. Both of us had fallen asleep.

In the morning I fed her and felt nauseous still. The room spun around. I tried to stay sleeping but it was hard with her barking.

I ate breakfast and took my pills. I haven't sorted the ones for the next week. I downloaded a trial for a week of Photoshop and Illustrator. I haven't updated the resume nor talked to my parents about my plans.

I did ask my dad yesterday in the united states the prices of the rent in the capital and my thoughts about selling the jetta. I didn't say I wanted to use the money to maintain myself the first months there. I don't recognize what is it that scares me. Does he know my intentions of actually being in Mexico city?

I could make two hundred and fifty more words to reach the limit, to fill the quota that I missed yesterday.

I have more visible stubble. Even now after just a day of shaving I can see the black little hairs on my moustache and chin and even my cheeks. There is a promotion on the laser place where if you buy more than three sessions they give you a 50% discount. I used a similar deal for buying four sessions. I could use three this time, but I don't have the money. Should I tell them I am trans? Do they have to know?

I've been five months on hormones now. one hundred and seventy days today. In two weeks I'll have been on them for half a year. Do I look different enough?

Am I content with how I look?

Yesterday my mom told me how Jessica is upset because I have more bust than her. "I use fillings, too". But I don't.

My bras are a little small on the cup now. I bought another one yesterday but it doesn't fit right. The band is too tight, even on the furthest hook.

I hope is colder soon so I can wear coats and hoodies. I am more comfortable covering my body.

There are some flea bites on my feet and legs. Days before I found two bug bites on my left thigh. Today I found another one on my right.

The little red balls on my feet are itching. The rash I had on my elbow is dry now. Will it heal?

Will I heal?

## 2016-10-10

Nymeria is under me, she's playing with her snake. I am watching South Park on the tv in the living room. The episode right now is the one where the gang is on a school news show and is being cancelled because of a more popular show. I've seen it already. I can focus on writing and just hear the conversations of the first half that I didn't see.

Catherine was here earlier. Just half an hour ago she left.

I didn't remember when was it that we had plan for her to come.

In the morning I woke up near seven when Nymeria woke up and asked for food. She didn't let me sleep after that and I decided to get up anyway and came to the living room. I lied on the couch and ate my breakfast before taking my pills. In a couple of weeks I'll be turning six months on hormones.

I put South Park and let Nymeria fall asleep on my lap. The first and only episode finished and my eyes were closing. They felt so heavy that it was tiring keeping them open. I woke Nym up and took her to her box and put myself on bed. I fell asleep not much later. I know I dreamed several things. Was my dad on them? Was Catherine?

I remembered them when I woke up.

Last night I put several books on my waiting list in Amazon. Most of them were of Trans themes. Am I really interested in reading them? Did I made progress yesterday? No, it was before that. Lately I haven't opened it. The folder of the CV templates is still unopened and the countdown of the trial keeps getting smaller.

I stopped the episode and put the next one. I recognized the moment when they go to the pharmacy to buy the cough syrup so they can get ideas. The next one is the one with Paris Hilton and the contest of whoring with Mr Slave.

This is the next one. I haven't seen it.

I slept while Nymeria got up and my grandma fed her. I kept dreaming and resting. I got up after noon and I had a message of Catherine that she was showering.

I got ready. I put out a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. I wore the black bralette that I bought this weekend. I decided not to put any make up on. After just a shower I still felt comfortable with my face.

Catherine got here after some minutes. She sent me a message asking me what to bring. I told that she didn't have to bring anything but her cute little toochie. She told me that she could pass to the Oxxo before coming here. I came to her car and we drove down. We bought a bag of tostitos and a bottle of clamato.

In here we saw an episode of Luke Cage and ate chicken and rice. We were in the couch watching the last parts of the episode when I started brushing her thigh under her dress with the tip of my fingers. I told her how in the morning, while I was watching television I let my hand slip into my pajama pants and started caressing the tip of my sex.

Sex... Why didn't I type penis? Don't I dare to call it by its name? Before, there were moments when I called it clitoris. She called it that way as well... When was it when she mentioned me her doubts about that and how should she refer to my genitals.

She told me that she felt that kind of urges, too, but she did satisfy them. We both thought about going to my bedroom like before. I don't remember who was the one that actually mentioned it.

The episode finished and we went there. We kissed and touched each other. She was wearing a black dress and just after I thought it she mentioned that I should be wearing another one. I mentioned I could change and after considering she agreed. I put on the gray one she gave to me and let her see me in my new underwear.

We had sex, she was touching me when I warned her that I'd be coming soon. Nothing came out. It's a month and a half since I had an orgasm.

We kept doing it and I made her finish.

We watched Mean Girls until my family arrived.

She brought the formats and tests. I can sort them according to their type and pass and scan the ones that correspond to us.



## 2016-10-11

Am I in an endless nightmare?

I feel trapped in those sorts of dreams where I have a complete different life with other past and worries and I'm terrified of the future. I know I dreamed something. It wasn't in the morning, but at the nap I took at noon. My family kept calling me Ivan and it hurt. I can't remember the rest. Some sort of conferences and halls with chairs.

It wasn't important.

Will I wake up now? And all of these worries and problems won't be important, I won't even be able to remember after a couple of hours of being awaken.

In less than two weeks I'll be turning 6 months. Am I different enough? Is that a good or a bad thing?

I finished grouping the formats of my part time job. I do have a part time job, more of a freelancing gig. I have something to do, even though I don't do nothing. I have opened the Curriculum templates but have filled none of them.

One of the applications has been up. The master of neurobiology is the one. Will I apply to that one? I don't need letters of recommendation and that means I could avoid going for teachers and dealing with asking for and reading letters of Ivan's achievements and skills.

I can't even get to half of the words.

It's monday and I haven't sent the e-mail to the editor who asked for trans writers. Will I do that? Or will it be another passed opportunity?

Yesterday I talked with Catherine. I mean, we talk everyday but there was something different this time. Today we haven't talked much. I don't feel like it. In the bathroom I considered breaking up. Am I mad? Am I angry? No. Then what is it? What happened?

She told me how her parents were sleeping in different beds. They've been fighting lately and she's sick o it. I asked her how would she react if they got a divorce. They haven't been married for more than a month and they're already sleeping in different beds.

"I've seen them together, married by the civil, now by the church, and things don't change, doesn't matter the hassle that is marriage. I don't know, I don't feel excitement or illusion. And I know you do, a little."

She had told me before when I asked her to talk about getting married, filling the papers of immigration. She doesn't want us to get married just because of a green card. She doesn't want it to be just because of convenience. And now she tells me she sees no reason to do it.

"Then why don't you want to marry me?"

"Honestly, I think we need to grow before engaging to each other. It's not about age or maturity. But you need to get to know yourself a lot. And I need to accept myself, too. I'm still scared that my family knows I like women, you're still absorbed in yourself and sometimes I feel left behind. With those feelings I don't feel ready to marry you."

I told her about how it's because she's going to USA and I feel here. I feel trapped and she's one of my keys to get out. She says she wants to be with me, apply to the master and get into it.

"But if you don't get into it, you can just keep on with your life without me. It hurts that I need you more than you me."

"You have to find your life, without me, without nobody. Even if I go, you'll have to move and start accommodating your life. Here I couldn't come with you everywhere. There is no way for me to guarantee that I'll be with you forever.
I'm not saying that I don't want to be with you or that I won't.
It's the truth, we don't know what can happen. In March I had surgery, in January that you made your appointment to the endocrinologist we never thought I'd be recovering from surgery when you would go.
It hurts, I know you're hurt, but we haven't had a single date without talking about this.
We don't know what's going to happen, Sofia."

I read her message and said nothing. What was there to say? What was it that hurt me so much? Is it the fear of being alone? Are the words of Rene resonating in my mind about having a support network and needing to expose myself and ask for help? She's telling me that I can't count on her nor anyone. I have to do this alone. But it is too much for me. I can't.

I thought about breaking up. Fifteen minutes later she sent another message:

"I love you. I hug you and am fascinated by your scent, I like feeling you close. I like chatting with you and watch the TV together. I feel comfortable, at peace with you"

Half an hour later I answered back that I loved her and another half hour later I dreamed again with the ex that left me.

## 2016-10-12

My grandmother asked me if I have a picture of Nymeria when she was small and I just bought the flower cushion. I searched in my phone and actually have one from the day I bought the cushion. She's lying on the center, her tiny body barely covering the yellow circle. She was over almost the whole cushion. She's grown. She's changing color, from a recently born white to a cinnamon brown tint.

What happened today?

I did not sleep after getting up and serving Nym's breakfast. I returned to bed but she did not let me sleep. I got up. Last night Catherine sent me a text message asking if I love her. I answered yes. I hesitated. What was it? Is the chat about marriage? Is it the feeling of betrayal? What did she do to betray me? She hasn't cancelled her application. She says she wants to, and is going to. I'm projecting all my fears unto her. I'm blaming her for the anxiety of being alone.

I went to the kitchen and ate the burrito that was wrapped and then made another one with the leftover in the pan. Did I watch television? Did I read? What did I do?

I showered and got ready for leaving to therapy. I wore the crimson jeans and the gray long-sleeved blouse. I hesitated before putting on make up. It's not about looking feminine, it was doubting about if it was worth it.

Nymeria barks now when I leave the house. Does she miss me? Does she love me?

I parked in Sam's parking lot. I keep remembering that time when I wore a gray dress and found Monica and her boyfriend. I won't find her or them when going to therapy. Both of them work for sure.

I walked the blocks to the building and got into the office. It's the second time that I get in early because of an absent patient before my time. I cried in this session, but what was it? He asked something. It triggered a thought but I can't remember it.

I did not mention my thoughts about breaking up with Catherine. Last night before sleeping I realized that breaking up would mean losing another best friend.

I try, and want to, hide who I am. I want to bury down the fact that I am trans and live a normal life. I hate the idea of being discriminated or looked down. I feel that whenever someone, or anyone deny me, I won't have the security to defend my self, who I am.

I hate this vulnerability and sense of fragility.

That's when I cried. When I got that thought and let it out of my mouth.

At work or at school, you can just do that, 'My name is Sofia and I am a trans girl'.

"Let me give you an advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like an armor and it can never be used to hurt you."

He finished the session and asked if the device that was in the couch next to my purse was an ipod. "I thought they don't make them anymore" "They don't, I barely got this one. You have to buy them used."

I got down the elevator and walked back to my car. There was a malfunction with the parking voucher.

Getting home Nymeria got out of her box and came to me. I had to punish her in a time out because of her biting the training mat. She is in my room now, probably asleep.

Lili sent me a text message after returning saying there is an evaluation for this Friday's afternoon. I didn't fill the templates of the resumes but did update mine. I took out several things that I thought useless. Being in the highest places of high school, or exposing an educational software. I took out the autism forum and other stuff... I wanted to take the name out but it has to stay.

I reviewed the guide of the test. It's simple enough, an analysis of a Wechsler test results, the basic information about neuropsychology and neuroanatomy and neurophysiology and a last section of reading comprehension of english texts.

The general one is about the stuff I like about psychology, mostly research and methodology.

Why am I worried, then? Why do I keep doubting about which one to choose? Will they answer my e-mail? Catherine is right, maybe I should call, or send another one.

I have this month to decide.

## 2016-10-13

I got an answer about yesterday. I told Catherine last night to wake me up with her and don't let me fall asleep again, nor let me get to when she'd leave for job without sending the e-mails.

I woke up to feed Nymeria. Catherine was awake already, I guess. Did I dream something? No... In the middle of the night I covered myself from the cold. I failed to stay awake. I made myself breakfast an hour after the first light of the day. I was sitting in the couch watching South Park when she asked me. "Have you sent the e-mails?"

She was right. There were two, no, three e-mails that I promised I would send. The first one was to actually send the message I had redacted in the contact tab of the Master's site, the second was to post a comment in the comment section of the master in psychology and the third one was to contact the editor about the possibility of sending an article for the trans blog.

I tried sending the redacted message but it was stuck. Looking at the other site, I scrolled to see the comments, to review the dates of the last ones, when I got to a message that one of its words struck my attention. It mentioned another master and the possibility of applying to both. I read the answers. The first one was a question asking for clarification, did she intend to take both? Or was it with the intention of having a back up plan and picking lastly the chosen one were she accepted on both.

There was an answer but the question was two years old. I showed Catherine and that was her reply. I grabbed the email under the format of contact and wrote a message on Inbox. I sent it and received an answer a couple of minutes later. An affirmative answer. The system does allow it.

The answer, as expected as it was, made me more nervous.

I can apply to both, I can have twice the opportunities of getting into a prestigious master, of achieving my goal. But twice the possibility makes the fail twice as painful.

I have the guides, the bibliography of one and the content of the other. For one I need the review the things I know, for the other learn what I don't. The thought of driving to the university and studying in the library came to my mind and I actually consider it. Going somewhere, doing something, actually feeling like I am accomplishing something.

Being able to register now, made me feel anxious. I feel the pressure of it. The first thing I tried to calm it was to look at the dates, the deadlines. I have until January to send the first batch of papers. Then I noticed that I have until December to put my data on their system and register myself. The other application opens by the end of November. The first test will be by the second week of February.

It's true, everything is close and near. The dates keep passing by like light-posts on a highway.

It's hard, thinking about everything that I'll endure and do, but at the same time, it's amazing thinking that the changes keep happening and I'll keep looking different.

That will make things harder, still, but... sigh, it doesn't matter.

I told my mom when she arrived about the open application and how I can apply to both. "What are we going to do? How are we going to do it? I mean, the trip and staying there... will I stay from the first trip in february for the first test? It's actually cheaper than going and coming."

She told me to look up the information, the rates of rent and costs and all of that.

My father was at the table. I mentioned nothing, but I guess my mom did. He looked at me and talked at me, but I did not hear him. Instead of calling my name, he repeated himself.

"Is the application open?"

I told him that it was and that I can apply to both. He said nothing more.

Will I work there? How will I maintain myself while at the same time be able to go to the tests and the different procedures that I want to do. I could look for a part time job in the evenings. Or something in the weekends?

I don't know. I don't know.



## 2016-10-14

Three trans women have been killed in Mexico in the last two weeks. Two were in Mexico City and another inside the country. Just now I read the news about a fourth one. It's just a status update on Facebook, shared on the Trans Forum. I tried to ignore it. Not ignored, but stay skeptical. It could be a false alarm, it said it in the message itself.

I viewed the forum and stumbled upon the same post of the girl who put a photo of a thin blonde. I suspected it was fake. In her profile there were just pictures of anime and said she was from London. Even after my suspicion I just ignored her. I don't care about meeting anyone in there. I didn't introduce myself when they accepted me. I'm nobody to criticize or judge her. There were new comments in there, several people had the same suspicion and told her to put a real picture. She had commented that she was stalked before so she was cautious. She added a picture "of a friend and me". Under her comment there were a couple of others telling her nowadays it's really easy to do a reverse search of a picture. If she didn't want to show herself, don't put a picture, but not put a fake one.

I told Catherine about the incidents with Nymeria. Today she pooped and it was kind of liquid, runny. I took a piece of glass out of her mouth. Yesterday, or in the week, Liliana told us about an evaluation. I took it. Catherine has a job already. She picked me up at 4. I saw my patient. Arantza, she's a 21 year old girl who is in because of a depression. She has suicidal ideation already. She tried once already when she was intoxicated.

From there we ate in River Plaza.

I dreamed with Monica again, and couldn't help to think about seeing her somewhere in there. Catherine and I ate Ramen in the Food Garden. We walked to some stores and shopped around. She brought me home and Nymeria welcomed me by the door. She was different, something about her. It seemed like she shat just fine, not runny like earlier. She wasn't excited or hyperactive, it was something else, weird.

I changed the training pads because they were full. She growled at me and threw bites at my ankles. I remember MuÃ±eca's attacks the first times I were to Catherine's house. I was upset. She's my dog, my puppy, she loved me and came looking for me. Why was she behaving like this?

I tried to put the new pads and tape them to the floor, but she ran at the tapes trying to take them off. I closed the room with her inside to put the one in the living room. She stayed there. When I returned to change clothes, she bit me again but this time it really hurt. Unintentionally I kicked the pain away and she flew a couple of feet almost hitting the closet.

After opening the door, she went to Luis and I heard him saying "No, Nymeria, not there", I thought it was her biting the pad but they were apart from it. I told her not to bite him and approached them. She bit my big toe and I hit her with the roll of newspaper. She squeaked and cried, a lot calmer and lie down on the cushion.

I felt sad and guilty. It was something I oughted to do. It had to be done. She tried going upstairs several times so I shut her in my room.

She's in there right now, quiet. Probably she is asleep now.

I've been writing the words for almost an hour now and I can't seem to finish. I have something to do now. I have a patient, I have two tests to study for and a book to finish.

There was an update on the post about the fourth trans victim. She wasn't dead but in critical condition. She was shot by some people in a gray Audi.

Four people in two weeks. Three in the city I am trying to live in.

I can't stay in this country, I am in danger. But I am trapped. How can I get out? I told Catherine and mentioned the asylum detention centers. If I go to Canada, I won't be able to see my family again.

She asked me if it was something I suppose or I had read about it. I looked it up and it was true. In the United States at least, an asylum-permit can be revoked if there is evidence that the person put itself on danger of being persecuted again.

I told her. And then I saw, Canada uses detention centers, too. There are lots of news and pages talking about the Human Rights breaches in those places, and I felt sick.

"I understand, she told me"

I felt rage. No, you don't.

You're not trans, you have citizenship, how would you understand?

She said nothing but :/

"Have you heard the song? Joaquin Sabina, he has a song called "Black tights", like yours", it was a little awkward but I found it charming. I knew the song, of course. That might have to do with it. I'm hearing it right now. Did I know it because of my ex?

I thought I knew The Beatles because of her, but that's not exactly true. My father had asked me to burn him a disc with the compilation of their discography. Even before that, a classmate in middle school was a fan, he sang the songs and knew their history. I already recognized and were familiarized with Paul's Yesterday.

I dreamed several things but remember scarcely anything. In one of my dreams I had people over, Eusebio and Jessica, and Paolas, as well. I don't remember seeing Monica in there. There were plates of different kinds of food, and there were cards, too, like a type of game. I don't remember seeing any alcohol. It wasn't really this house. Was it in Mexicali? There were other people. Some relatives came and did or said something. Paola S asked if all my family was like that. With "that" she was referring as something like rude or obnoxious. One of them heard and answer back that of course not. They were the good ones.

I explained how they weren't that close, they were the daughters of the brother of my grandma.

Just yesterday I mentioned Catherine how I don't usually dream with her. When I said that I was thinking about the last dream with my ex.

Even now, why can't I let her go? I see Nymeria in my room, running towards her bed, and wandering sniffing the floor. She goes to grab one of her toys, but stops just before reaching it. She grabs her giraffe and comes to me with her toy on her mouth. She climbs the stairs and stays there. And I watch her and feel so many new emotions. I want to brag about her, show her off. I think about telling all about my dog, my puppy to her. Like those times.

But she's dead. No, she's not. She's different. I'm different, too. And the past is gone.

I returned to bed after breakfast by noon. I let Nymeria climb the bed and put her over my legs. We both fell asleep and I dreamed some other things.

Catherine and I had plans of seeing each other in the US after her work shift. I asked her several times in the morning for confirmation. Finally we decided to cancel it. There is no point, the public transport runs fewer times on Sunday and she'll be tired and time will be scarce.

Next week, probably Monday, I'll go to the library in the university. I do want to study, and actually going and spending on gas might motivate me to not lose my time.

I haven't signed up in the system of the application. Am I scared, nervous? Catherine is right. I am smart, I have good possibilities of doing well on the test and getting in.

Luis asked me if I liked going to Six Flags, if I'd go again were the entrance paid off. I told him no. He asked why and I replied asking him why, will he go? I thought maybe he wanted me to go with him.

He said he won't, he doesn't like big rides. "When will it be?" "Next year, October"

"I won't be here by then... I'll be in Mexico City" and I dared to say it with the security of it being a fact. I said the words out loud as if I were not afraid of cursing my luck. I saw his face and felt guilt. Will I leave him alone? Will I leave Nymeria alone?

What if they need me?

What if I need them?

I will talk with my mom about asking for some money to pay the next laser sessions. Yesterday I shaved to meet my patient and just 24 hours after I already have a black shadow.

My father said Ivan in a really low voice handing me the money of my week. "Did you say something back?", asked Catherine when I told her.

No, I didn't. Will I? I took the money, I need it. As soon as I got yesterday's pay I spent it on a date.

"Do research on the rent and those things, we'll see how we'll deal with it" I don't have to go through everything alone.

Well, yes, but not totally.

I hope.

## 2016-10-16

I have things to do again. My to-do list doesn't have to be empty anymore. Last week, I just remembered, I filled some entries on Wunderlist. Haven't I done anything or did I just forgot?

What is this that I am feeling right now? Is it irritability or sorrow? Am I sad or angry?

I opened YouTube in my tablet as I was lying on bed. Was I looking for something specific? No, I saw in Facebook a picture of Victoria shared by Paloma. I remembered about her procedure of updating her passport. I got into her profile and read the status update of the three transfeminicides that Catherine told me about. The comments were disconcerting. I don't really understand how can they still affect me. I should be accustomed to them by now. They don't say nothing new.

From there I went to the YouTube app and looked her on the search bar. I didn't end on one of her videos. She appeared on the evening news from one of the biggest tv channels of the country. The comments were worse and yet the same. I know them by heart I could categorize them in different types. There are the obvious "trolls" who comment with the sole intention of enraging people, thinking themselves as funny. Then, there are the ones who think they're being respectful and tact, just stating their "personal opinions". They're the first one to get defensive and saying how the LGBT people are the intolerant ones attacking them for asking questions. There are supporters who comment stating how they see the first sane ones or they "respect" their insights and courage of defending "the obvious". Others are the loving supporters who come defending the community.

I don't think I can remember about a single comment that has make me feel better or make the action of reading the comments worth.

Today I slept two hours after Nymeria's breakfast. I was in the living room when my dad left and arrived with the Carl's jr meals and the tacos.

I took the pills. The dispenser is empty. I have no need to go to the pharmacy still. Another day passed and I made no mention of the laser session. Last night I thought about them. I thought about grabbing the phone and calling and setting the appointment in his name. Would I need to consciously make my voice more masculine? How would I go dressed? Would it be uncomfortable, bearable?

Should I come out to them? It's not like men going to depilating their beard is something really common.

Maybe they noticed since the very beginning. Who knows?

Tomorrow I'll go pick up Catherine's patient's file. After that I can make use of the shower and clean change of clothes and go to the library to test the idea of studying in an external place. Tuesday I will take Nymeria to the vet. I told Catherine that I will pick her up with Nymeria and stop at the vet on my way home. From here I can drive her wherever we'll go.

Wednesday I'll see Rene again and Friday I'll meet my patient for the first round of tests.

I don't feel nervous anymore. I do, but not about her. Does it make a difference if she clocks me?

Nymeria is lying on her cushion beside my feet. I left her home, alone in my room for most part of the afternoon. I mopped the floor of my room and felt different about letting her in there.

After breakfast my father asked my mother if she wanted to go to the movies. They told Luis to go shower and get ready. I considered declining their potential invitation. I wanted to stay home, lie in my bed and resting from all the things that I will have to do eventually. Catherine worked today, I guess. She told me to go, it's been a long time since I've gone out with my family. I can't even remember the last time we went out apart of going to the United States. I showered and changed.

I picked one pair of jeans from the lot I took out of the dryer machine. I cut shaving like I hadn't done in a while. A centimeter long crimson line on my cheek. I didn't know what to wear. I have things in my closet, both masculine and androgynous and feminine.

I picked the Mickey t-shirt and the long black cardigan.

In Galerias I looked around thinking I'd see somebody. My mother was the one who saw three different known people.

## 2016-10-17

Today was a long day of nothing.

How am I supposed to fill the daily 750 words if I don't do nothing in the whole day? I could type about my dreams. I had several.

I told Catherine how I knew some of them weren't good yet I could not really remember. I was somewhere where it was supposed to be my house. Relatives were visiting or something like that. They addressed me by an old name. I could talk to Nymeria. She was bigger, was she still a dog? It was time to feed her, and there were other beings in the house, too.

I took Nymeria outside after noticing her sniffing around the floor near her mat. She ran around with a strap of the mop on her mouth. Whenever I would get close to her, she'd slid away running as fast as she can. I would corner her behind the race car Miguel and his team built in high school. I stepped on her strap and took it from her. I opened the door and she would slide through the air rapidly as if she could fly.

I fed her in the morning and tried to stay awake. Even after returning to the bed she would not let me sleep. No, I took her outside and she did her business. I did not talk with Catherine until after. My grandma had left me some eggs in the pan. I ate them and watched some tv before taking my pills. She played a little in the living room until she tired off on her cushion. I slept less than 6 hours in the night, so I was as tired as she was. I woke her up and lead her to my room. I got under the sheets and shared my bed with her. We both fell asleep. It was around ten or eleven o'clock. I put the alarm at 1. I slept and dreamed, and she stayed still by my legs.

Catherine is home by now. She talked with my while her bus arrived. She told me how she felt bad because of certain comments on the weekend. She's ashamed of working in a Carl's Jr. There was something in her issue that I took badly. She's ashamed because she's a graduate. I wanted to console her, give her a new perspective and reason to calm down and be relieved.

We see patients some times, the friend of my mom who's a psychologist told her how she found her first job two years after graduating. I thought about the people on our Facebooks, recently I noticed how they've been changing jobs, going from one to the other. Tere, who was a counselor in a high school, posted about unemployment and then how she had become a teacher. Elena who bragged about being offered a promotion adn then working in an office in the HR department, today posted about her first day being a prefect.

Were they fired or promoted or just offered better opportunities? How can they get several and I none? Us...

I retook our conversation and concluded: don't be desperate. They told us that if we put our own private practice, there would be a couple of years until we had a base clientele.

She replied: you don't get desperate about a job.

It was a spark that kindled my anger. I got conscious about my upsetting.

I explained how it was not just that I could not find one. It's me being transgender, how should I present to the interviews and show my papers and exposed myself to the potential discrimination and mocking.

And then I saw it, she was coming to me, about her job in the united states, how she's getting dollars, but she's ashamed because being a graduate she has a job in the fast food industry.

Where does I that let me? I can't even job in the United States, I have no job and I am a graduate as well. If she's a failure because "what's the point of so much study" then I am a bigger one having never gotten even a single job.

And I tired to console her.

I told her and she answered back with an advice. I should suck up to teachers. Well, later, I could suck up to anyone who gives me an in.

Every time she answers my whining with an advice I feel how she doesn't understand. Why am I worrying if there are so many simple solutions?

Why worry about facing work discrimination and being a vulnerable minority looking for a job? I can just suck it up to people and be fine.

Two more vaccines in a single application next week and her vaccines are done. A reinforcement three months later and then yearly. I guess it's gonna be alright that Nymi can stay in Catherine's house for the weekend. I don't really know why the idea excites me. She staying with her, befriending MuÃ±eca.

Today was the first day that I'd be leaving the house for different appointments. I woke up before Nymeria. I looked around and turned the lights. She raised her white sharp head and those big black eyes where fixated on me. I had woken from a dream where I was in this same house coming from a different home. At first I was alone in the back seat of a van drove by no one. I climbed to the driver's seat and continued the trip. In some way I got here with both of my brothers. As I told Catherine when I remembered and started retelling it, I came here looking for the Aerostar mini-van that we used to have when we lived in the other house. It served the place of the jetta in my plan of selling it for getting funds to my first months living in Mexico City. My father had driven it and parked here. "It's in the second file of parked cars that gets full when there is a party". It was empty. There was no mini-van in sight. I took out my phone and tried to contact my father. There were some inconveniences with its functions and it wasn't until several tries that I was resigned to the idea that the van was stolen, and so, gone.

I fed the dog and took her out to do her shit. Almost immediately we return and I came back to bed. We both slept for two more hours. The house was silent. Almost empty except by us and my grandma sleeping in her room. I ate a burrito for breakfast that was saved in a kitchen towel. It was a burrito of meat and potatoes. I thought about taking one of the weekend's biscuits, but didn't.

After finishing the season of South Park I took some clothes of the closet and went to the bathroom to take a shower. I put Nymeria in her bed box and closed the door on my room. She stayed quiet for a while, but kept moaning and crying while I shaved my body and washed my hair. As I was shaving my face her laments were almost continues. I tried shushing her and consoling her with my voice but it resulted ineffective. My grandma got out of her room and asked me "are you in the shower?" I was standing in front of the sink with a face lathered and the wet body covered by a tank top and panties. "Yes", I lied although she could completely see me outside of it.

She came down and took her out of the room while I finished rinsing and cleaning the brush and razor.

I hesitated while changing. I put on my pants in the bathroom but didn't know what to wear over. I had thought about the light cream blouse with the scoop neck. As I tried it on, I felt it too tight and a wave of discomfort washed me over as I look the reflection of my whole body. I took out a striped white one and tried it. There was something that felt off still. I changed again to the green one I ended up with. Yesterday was cold, so I realized I would need a jacket or light sweater. I had taken out the long red one but it felt wrong. I tried the black one, but it didn't match with the brown flats. I took the gray one I bought at Target and sent a picture to Cathy.

I changed the sweater to the long black one and the flats to the blacks.

I took Nymi's to Catherine's house and from there I drove to the vet office. We got home and I fed her.

I drove to Lili's where she picked up the file of her next evaluation and she sat in the driving seat on the way to Playas. We got to Argana were we ate and smoked. We stayed there for a while, the waitress welcomed us in the couch of the first floor with a "girls". Does she know I'm trans? The dark skinned one from before we left three years ago does.

We walked on the beach and talked. On our way home we sang to the tunes of the songs on her spotify.

Tomorrow I'll go to the meeting at work and my session and then to the library. Will I register myself finally on the system?

## 2016-10-19

I can't remember the last time I wrote the words out of my house. Was I in Mexicali? Maybe I wrote them in the phone somewhere... Right now I'm sitting in the top floor of the library. I came here to have some free and quiet time dedicated just to study. I guessed that being here would force me to focus and do only the thing I came to do.

I guess I was wrong.

I did not study absolutely anything.

Well, I did transcript the guide to the red notebook, although I haven't decided if I'm going to make the notes on the notebook or use the special notation app of the Laptop. Using the one on the laptop has the benefits of being faster and, of course, way more legible. The notebook has its portability. I can take it here without carrying the two pound laptop.

I went to the meeting with Liliana and her other "girls". It was Friday when I went to attend the last patient and the office was "full". She mentioned it yesterday when Catherine and I picked up the integration of the battery applied to her patient and now today as well.

I noticed the eyes of the other girl, the younger one. Did she notice me? I sensed the changes of my voice and the slips of Lili's "son"s.

Maybe dressing this androgynously wasn't such a good idea.

I had thought about wearing the dark jeans and the stamped half-buttoned-up blouse. I was already clothed when I changed my mind. I put on a plain black t-shirt and over it, the red flannel that I have since I can't remember when. These last days I've been hesitating with my choice of clothes. I feel uncomfortable in them and anxious about the way I look. This time it was unexpected the calmness I felt when I looked myself with this clothes.

The meeting lasted about an hour. We talked about... Have I really just forgotten the topics about the meeting? She mentioned the cups and the coffee area. I gave her the formats and she repeated about the postulations of the possible flyers and ads. We added now the tryouts of a format for a contract of services.

I got in just in time. No, I got in two or three minutes late. Iris, is it? That's her name. She was already there chatting with Liliana. Gilda arrived just some moments after I sat. I got into my car at approximately 12 o'clock. I got into Rene's building half an hour later. I sat at the stairs and just listened to some music and relaxed. This session was calmed. He told me that next week he won't be able to see me. It's alright.

I ate in the cafeteria. It's weird that I know I had intentions of going to the bathroom and yet I haven't gone. Am I scared of entering the women's? I have done it here, haven't I? I entered with Catherine.

I am just two days shy of turning 6 months in hormones. I bought a sandwich and a bottle of water. I told Catherine my idea of buying a wrap from the coffee in the middle of campus. I remembered that I need to give my name after ordering. The cook is those kinds of people that think they're so funny that their sense of humor transcends rudeness.

I got into the library and filled the registration. I made another account of Khan academy. Maybe in there I can review the themes of Chemistry and biology.

Later I can just take out books from here and study at home. Or maybe another day I can come whenever I've felt trapped in my own house or room.

I feel tired. I woke up at 7. Nymeria barked at me but I was still half unconscious. My mind didn't comprehend her intention and I just stared at her. She went out of the plastic box that is her bede and positioned herself on her forelegs lowering her, is it a vagina? A vulva?

She peed in front of my bookcase and I just watch her. I fed her and took her outside. Her anus does look different when she wants to defecate. I can use that to guess and take her outside as training.

We returned to my room and I put an alarm for an hour later. I didn't make use of that time to rest. I couldn't return to sleep.

Maybe now that I've finished today's words I won't have to go late to bed.

## 2016-10-20

Today was another day of emptiness. I woke up early than usual, was it me or was it Nymeria? I fed her and took her outside. I tried to sleep again, but couldn't. Maybe for some minutes, but nothing significant. I'm sitting on the couch typing the words. Legends of Tomorrow is playing on the television. The protagonist of Suits is wearing a superhero costume. In a couple of minutes the second episodes of Supernatural will start. I watched the first one in the morning after growing tired of South Park.

Nymeria is biting the papers over the package of sheets for the printer. I took her to my room. It's tiring. Having to supervise her and watch every move. Maybe that's why I drove to the university yesterday.

I almost forgot my phone. As I was getting all my stuff in my backpack, I was chatting with Catherine over Whatsapp. I put the laptop and the cable, and then the notebook and the pencil bag. Everything was set and I put the backpack over my shoulder. I walked towards the lift and turned seeing if anyone had their eyes on me. I got into the lift and checked my appearance on the mirror. The male shirt didn't overturn the feminity of the rest of the outfit. My face is narrower and sharper, my skin is softer and clearer. I have changed enough.

I got away from the computer and cooked me some chicken in a piece of bread. I've finished now.

Where was I? In the lift. Getting out of the library I looked for my phone. The trousers I was wearing didn't have front pockets and the back ones were empty. The side pockets of the backpack were empty as well but for the water bottle. A flash of fear stomped me. Where could it be? Inside the backpack? I left it behind...

I went inside in a rush, got into the lift and pressed the button. I almost ran to the cubicle where I was seating hoping nobody had noticed it. It was there, on the shelf. I grabbed it and continued the conversation with Catherine.

I had to hit Nymeria again. She's bitting on that self pieces of paper. The folder of papers that my mother left in there. I struck her with the rolled newspaper. Does it hurt? She didn't cry.

I asked Catherine if she has plans for her mother's birthday. That same Saturday is Andrea's party. I can go, it will be late at night. Even if we go out that day, I'll be here by the evening. I looked at the event on Facebook, and specifically the list of guests. Am I scared of being introduced to them? Found out? Last party a year ago, those people weren't so nice and friendly. Will I be under threat?

Just now, remembering last party, I think I'll go. I might stay with Chevo and Jessica. Both Jessica and Paola have confirmed their assistance. I should not depend so much on Catherine. I don't know. I have still a day between now and then.

I've confirmed tomorrow's session, but haven't printed or even planned the tests I'll apply.

The meeting is appointed to tomorrow's evening. I have time, still.

I don't know what I'll wear, neither tomorrow or the day after. I'll wonder about that tomorrow.

Catherine went to work today. In one of her breaks she told me how Anahi would pick her up. Later, she apologized for being late, she said Catherine took her out to eat because both of them were angry. I jokingly told her, that I would cry were they had gone to In n Out. I've been telling her I want to go since months ago. We've postponed going countless times. I remember an imaged I had seen and, continued saying that were they'd gone to 5Guys, I'd commit seppuku.

She asked me what was that, and then played some audios telling me that she would take me to the restaurant after her next paycheck. She would take just me and pay the burger. I noticed how she didn't answer the question and sensed some guilt on her words and voice. I asked her again. And after a third time, she said that they did. She had promised Anahi.

I'd lie if I say I'm not upset. I was sad, I am disappointed.

It's weird because I don't feel my emotions are validated and yet I feel them. I had told her that I would go, but now I don't really want to.

I mean, I still have cravings for that food, but I don't want to go with her.

Is that the reason why I want to stay on the party after her leaving, or even go without her?

## 2016-10-21

"Are you mad at me?"

Was her the first message after hours or was it a reply after mine? Was I mad at her?

I feel something, but what? We talked after I got out of my session. It was the first conversation of more than three consecutive words that we've had since the beginning of the day.

I'm sitting right now at the dinner table, beside my grandmother and with Nymeria by my feet. Deadpool is on the television and Miguel is asleep on the couch.

I woke up a couple of minutes after six. I don't really remember even if I dreamed or not. Catherine texted me she was still asleep or just waking up. I ignored her... No, she answered the last questions I made her last night. She doesn't think she'll go to Andrea's party, she might go out with her mother to dinner, and she'll surely be pretty tired at night. The day after, Sunday, her father had said he had plans of going out to the Valle de Guadalupe. He hadn't confirmed anything. She was planning on asking him, but he was asleep last night.

I answered with and "Ok". I kept thinking about yesterday. I remembered Monica's upsetting when I went to Fuddruckers with Anahi and Catherine some years ago. I thought it was absurd. I had reasons of not going with her. I had offered her taking her, crossing by feet and taking the trolley. She was the on who declined. And now she was mad at me because I went.

What's the difference now? Catherine had invited me times before and I declined. I used the money as an excuse. I am in not place for spending the few dollars I have. Anahi took her. They had an opportunity and took it. I have no right to be mad nor upset.

But I still am.

Maybe that's why I don't say anything. But keeping those feelings to me only makes things worse.

Miguel sent me a message in the morning asking if I went out or were busy. Could I pick him up from school? He uses the feminine with me. I remember the time he asked my grandma about me, using my name.

The only one left is my dad. He used Ivan way more times before. I guess he is taking the idea. It's been 6 months since I started hormones. Half a year to take the idea. Three months, maybe, after I went public. Have the relatives from his side said anything to him about me? Some didn't add me right after, the closer ones, actually.

We have gone to Mexicali just a couple of times, but I haven't seen anyone from that side of the family in a long time.

This weekend is Andrea's party. Next Tuesday I'll have the third session with my patient and the day after I won't have mine. Later that same day is the birthday of Diego, Paola's son. I should go buy him a gift or something. Maybe we'll go to the United States.

I don't know what else to write about. I could scan the papers to upload them to the site. I am finally registered. I started studying math again in the Khan site. For now just reviewing the early and easy subjects of algebra and geometry, things of middle school and high school. It's a little disconcerting how I passed most of the Math classes with perfect A's and yet I barely remember how to do most of those things.

They are part of the syllabus of the test so I'm not really wasting my time.

Statistics is another of the next subjects in Khan and the most important subject in the psych test and a significant one of the Science one.

The time is shorter than what I imagine. The first test is by mid February, just a month an a half after new year's, which is a little more than two months from now.

Will I do it? Will I be able to?

Will I survive?

Most of the people I know have a master's. The grown ones I mean. No, that's not true. Not most of them, most of the teachers, but that's a biased view.

Why am I scared? I've talked this with Rene. It's not a condition anymore for the procedure of changing the name. Why am I still preoccupied with my ability and results.

Because it's my future.

I wasn't able to imagine me now. Maybe that's why I am scared. Because I am wandering blind.

Catherine is out with her parents celebreting her mom's birthday. They are on a Chinese food buffet. She sent me some messages a couple of minutes ago. We didn't talk much today.

I woke up early in the morning, so that I had to wait before feeding Nymeria. I did try to sleep again but she did not let me. My father went out and brought breakfast. Luis did not ask for anything, There were four biscuits, a burger, crisscuts fries and a bag of hash browns in the paper bag. I assumed the biscuit were for my mom and grandma, and the burger for Miguel. What would Luis eat? He came down before Miguel and I hadn't finished my food yet. I asked him and he said he didn't ask for anything.

I guess I was pretty hungry. I didn't even hesitate before deciding to eat two of my biscuits. My grandma and mother came down and I was already in my room when they ate. They asked Luis what did he crave but he answered nothing. My grandma insisted over and over, suggesting him meals she could make him. After several failed tries, she told him she would make it anyway in case he did want it. I felt like screaming even though she wasn't talking to me and I wasn't even in the room.

My mother got angry and sent him to his room.

A while later, when I went upstairs for some reason, I passed beside their rooms and saw her standing in theirs with his arms surrounding her. I looked for more than an instant, so their hug was continuous. Was he crying? Did he confess something?

Catherine went to work. She will have unpredictable shifts all November and December because of the high needs of personnel. They let her out early.

Yesterday Gilda posted that there were two patients available for evaluation. Iris should contact her about the info of one and the other, which was looking for a vocational orientation, could be taken by either me or Catherine. In other conversation I asked her if I could have her. It was more like a courtesy. She has her job with a constant wage, her shifts are chaos and we've been talking about my need of money and economic pressure. She agreed.

I said I would take it and Gilda replied questioning me if I wanted her contact or should she give her mine. I hesitated. Should I ask for it so I'd have the control over contacting her? Or was it easier just letting her have it and waiting for their initiative. I opted for the latter.

Even this morning I wasn't sure about going to Andrea's party. I didn't. It wasn't much that Catherine wouldn't be there. I don't think I'd be very comfortable. Sure there would be new people who'd see me and I could sense their perception about me. But some of them I've met already. They saw me in a black skirt and cape, last year. I didn't like them much. What if Andrea hesitated introducing me to them? What if she told them? Is it ok me being scared of them knowing? Or was it more their attitude and personalities after a few drinks?

I think about my closet and clothes. Yesterday I had my patient. I applied some tests. I changed before picking Miguel up and put make up before having the session. I wore another male shirt over the blouse. Was I feminine enough? Did I felt comfortable enough?
I need more clothes, the season has changed. Soon, the climate will as well. Most of my clothes are short-sleeved and I lack jackets.

Luis told my father he needed to buy pants. He didn't have many or needed more or I don't remember what. My father asked him from where does he want them. "The United States". I asked if we'll go but didn't get a definite answer. It would be perfect if we went. I could buy some of the clothes I need and look for Diego's present for his party this Wednesday. I already proposed Catherine about giving him a gift from the both of us.

I counted the money after my father gave me the three green notes. This time he said no name and I thanked him silently. I have a little more than two thousand pesos and like ten dollars. I could use that money to buy the laser sessions myself.

I hadn't said nothing to my mother and the month is almost over. I would benefit lots of them, why am I bothered by the thought about them?

Oh, because it means using the phone and introducing myself as Ivan again.

## 2016-10-23

I don't feel much like typing, writing. My mind feels blank. I haven't slept since waking up in the morning. Nymeria wakes me for breakfast and stays active the first couple of hours of the day. After that, she fells into this kind of tired and slow state. She lets herself down on my legs or her cushion or sometimes even the floor. I envy her and resent her a bit.

I reviewed some early math subjects. Two or three chapters before finishing algebra. Geometry, trigonometry and then Statistics and Calculus, the things I should be learning.

It's unheartening, how most of the stuff I'm reviewing are things I've supposedly have learned already.

I haven't even started with biology and chemistry or physics.

Catherine was going to go to Ensenada, or Valle de Guadalupe or somewhere... We talked a little in the morning. I guess I was the first person to get up in the house. Luis came later and asked if my dad had brought breakfast. It was close to 9 in the morning. He wanted to wake him up. Yesterday he declined food and now he was about to wake him. I told him to wait. Moments later Grandma came down. Did she eat something? She offered him food.

Miguel and my father were next. My dad asked us if we wanted anything. My mother came down until after he returned.

Yesterday I saw an episode of Black Mirror. San Junipero. It was about a woman visiting this coast town in the 80's. In there she met another woman who was more accustomed to the region. The grow intimate and you see their relationship flower.

San Junipero is a town, but not one of any kind. They see each other after every week in this bar. Kelly is young and out-going, with black curly hair and dark skin. Yorkie is shy and cautious, her hair is light brown and her big eyes stay hidden behind big glasses. The finally get together and spent the night. Well, until midnight, anyway.

Next week, Yorkie can't find her. So she looks for her in different times.

They agreed to meet outside San Junipero. Kelly will visit her from Nevada to California. They get to know each other and marry. She helps her get her euthanasia.

I put the second episode of Falling water, but I can't seem to remember what happened on the first one. I guess I'll take it off. I didn't pay much attention the first time. Now, that I'm writing it's a lost cause. I am putting on instead Saturday Night Life. I don't have to see it, I can just hear the skits and pretend I'm caring.

Nymeria is tiring me. She keeps biting me every time I try to grab her.

My father took my mom to a concert in Cecut. She'll see a ballet recital where the daughter of her friend is gonna perform. My father just now is unlocking the front door. Nymeria ran to meet him and welcome him.

My next session will be before Friday. She said she would confirm Saturday. I guess I'll send her a text tomorrow asking for the time.

I registered for a conference Tuesday afternoon, but after seeing that they'll use my microphone and videocamera. I thought about unregistering, I was scared. What if they expected me to talk or say something? It's improbable and yet, I still don't know if I'm going to take it.

Wednesday will probably be free. No. I have Paola's reunion. Her son's birthday.

I'm still a hundred and fifty words left and I feel mentally exhausted. I studied most of the morning. Math is mentally consuming. But what I did should not count as math. It's elementary school leveled exercises. I should feel ashamed of struggling with simple algebra of middle school.

Catherine didn't go to the place she was gonna. They went to Playas, and after that to the house of somebody's grandma who has a birthday, too.

Tom Hanks is introducing the show, he's making a skit about being the father of America after being named "America's Dad". He put on a sweater and sat beside the chimney to have a talk.

I hear him and wonder about my own father. Would he sit and talk with me like that? Chat and try to understand what's happening to me. What has happened and what will. What will I do, how do I feel. How am I taking it.

Why don't I go and sit with him.

Is he scared, too?

## 2016-10-24

I remember always having a computer. Since before I could write there has always been a computer in my house. I was an only child in pre-school when I would enter into the "lil room" and play that game of a skiing man running away from a Yeti. It was always that end, when the Yeti appears and eats you and it's a sudden death. Game Over. That's it.

Lots of people grew with that name. I remember once reading on the internet someone saying how it was an allegory of the inevitability of death, and the finite nature of life. To later know about the person who later appeared with the knowledge that pressing some button you get the acceleration you need to avoid his grasp.

When did I got my computer? The PC in the lil room was my father's. Once I bought some food that came with a complimentary cd of a videogame. I was unable to play it because the computer had no CD-drive. Just floppy disks. We used those in grade school in the computers class to save our work and give homework.

I fantasized about having a laptop. I don't really know what was exactly what I fancied in them. I imagined myself taking it with me to Mexicali, to coffee shops, walking to other rooms, maybe sitting in the stairs and working on something. Writing? Reading? What did I use a computer for in those times?

I saw one in Costco once. It was a UMPC. Ultra Mobile PC. It was 10 inches wide. I didn't care about the specs or what I could use it for. I wanted it. I had the intention of saving money and buying it.

Years passed and I got into Macs. I think it was a movie about a scriptwriter working on one. I was already in High School? No, Middle School. I saved some money and my mother helped me with the rest. That was my first laptop. This is the second. The first one's hard drive failed and its battery started inflating. Instead of trying to repair it, my father bought me this one. I have six years with it.

I used it to write the scripts of the shorts of high school. I used it to edit the videos I made for my friends. I took it to Spain with me and talked to my family and friends through its screen. I've been writing these words this whole time in here.

Why did I started talking about computers? I remembered the scene of my imagination with the computer resting on my lap and my fingers tapping the keyboard. I used to try to imagine myself in the future. In grade school once when we returned from the US with my godmother and Jessica, my mother parked besides the middle school. We all talked about schools, their uniforms. The different colors of the jumpers depending on the grade of the girl and the boringness of the shit-colored boys' one. In high school, on the other hand, the skirt was nice and the boys wore jeans and a white polo. It was like wearing no uniform. To my child mind it was unimaginable. Jeans, not wearing uniform, going in your normal clothes.

By then I already had dreams about wearing a girl's uniform. I didn't think of them in that conversation. I tried imagining me wearing the khakis pants and shirt, or the jeans and polo. Even when I bought the first ones and tried them on, seeing myself in the mirror was weird. That was the way I would look for the next three years.

The thought of wearing a jumper never really crossed my mind.

In grade school I once had to do a homework where I had to draw myself as an adult. I put glasses on myself even though by then I didn't need them. There was something in me that knew they would be a part of me. I drew me with short hair although, by then, I already despised having it that way.

My life is immensely different to what I could had imagined. Lots of changes and things have happened.

And even now, after all that's happened, after living in Europe and finishing college, having a girlfriend and knowing the pain of a broken heart, being dumped and breaking up a relationship, juggling the hearts of two people, transitioning and coming out, being in a lesbian relationship... Even now I can't imagine what's going to happen next.

## 2016-10-25

I am worse than I thought. I am home with Luis by my side and Nymeria between my feet.

This day started really early. I woke up a couple of minutes past seven and feed the dog. There was a plate covered with a napkin left on the table. I was hungry. Was that for me? The red car was still in the parkway. There was nothing behind it but the empty street through the house in front of ours. My mom was still here but my brothers not.

My grandma asked me if I saw the burritos she left for me. I asked which were they. I asked again after not being heard. Those weren't mine after all. She handed them to me and I ate them so my stomach wasn't empty receiving my pills. Miguel turned behind me and asked me if I'd go out early, if I could take him to school by 9, 9 and a half.

Sure, why not. I didn't return to bed and I haven't rested since then.

I am in my pajamas after taking my clothes off. I thought about staying in the tank top and just putting over a hoodie. Two days ago there were some clothes on the couch, some of my father's pants and Luis' shirts or something. When she took them upstairs, my gray hoodie was with them. I put the other darker and thicker one but it was too much. Yesterday it rained, storm-like. Today I decided to wear the gray hoodie I bought at Target. Were it going to rain again or just be chilly it would be ok.

I went upstairs and my grandma was already lying on her blankets reading her ipad. The question of the location of the sweater didn't reach her ears. Again, I threw my words at her. And again I missed. Almost screaming I made myself be heard. I didn't found it and irritated came down and just put on a long-sleeved t-shirt. Still it isn't cold but by the middle of the night it refreshes.

I showered, shaved my body and almost drowned in nausea. I remember the time where I stepped out of the shower to throw up in the toilet before a cancelled plan with Catherine. Was this going to be like that?

It wasn't.

I changed and combed my hair and put make up on. I'll go take it off. Whatever is left, I mean.

So I took Miguel and Nymi by the same time. I grabbed my portfolio with the tests and my purse and told Miguel to get into the car. The last week, when I took Nymeria, she threw up on her box over the brown t-shirt. It could had been the heat. This earlier time it could be less probable that she'd get carsick. I was wrong.

She threw up when I left Miguel in the Tech. Then again after I moved her to the front seat. Before getting to the 7eleven to buy a soda, on the lights behind, actually, a person asking for money for a rehabilitation center approached my window. He addressed me in the feminine from the start. He called me m'ija and pretty when he asked me for money. "Can I sing you a son, beautiful?"

I told him I had no loose change. In the vet there was a different receptionist. I annotated our names in their sheet and sat to wait. 10, 15, 20 minutes passed. I was annoyed, sick, tired. I wanted to get home and rest. I am here now and I still need to rest.

I came home and tried to rest for the hour before my second time to leave. I got to the office and saw my patient walking upstairs with another person. Was she a patient of Lilli? just a friend of hers? I saw the closed door of the office and remembered I never told Liliana that I'd see the patient today.

I called her and told me she was in traffic. It was alright.

My patient introduced us. Her friend extended her hand and I reached her. Something crushed. Arantza looked at her and asked. "Oh, no, it wasn't me, it was he ...she" She apologized but I didn't realized if it was because of the misgendering or the hands. I apply the test and the hour went flying. Nymeria was already shot and I was already out. Catherine bought the present for Diego so I could go pick it up.

Getting there I parked ahead of where I usually do. Catherine told me there was ringbell after I sent her the message. And passing the door she added her uncle was home, so she didn't know how would he address me.

Was that it? I got inside and felt sick. I felt sad and dark. I was in pain.

Anahi would be getting there soon. In the way there, Catherine told me they were just sitting on the table but she could invite me a taco or something. When I got there, I lost my appetite.

I sat on the couch and she asked me several times how I felt. I told her I did not know. Didn't I? Why didn't I tell her I was in pain? I didn't know why, or even what exactly was tormenting me.

She asked me if I wanted to stay. I thought of Anahi and shook my head with tears in my eyes. I noticed how she was annoyed. "I thought we could just stay here, chat, do something.

I just wanted to lie down and cry.

Anahi got there and I did just that on her shoulder. Minutes later I said good-bye and came home.

I don't know if I'll go tomorrow to the party.

I don't know what's wrong with me.

## 2016-10-26

I haven't gone still to the pharmacy. I have until Saturday to buy the pills. I should be starting grading the tests or studying for the tests. Should I mention to them my application to the masters? I saw them. I went. Catherine did as well.

I showered in the morning. No, it was the afternoon. Yesterday I went to bed early with the weight of misery on my back and shoulders. A couple of hours later, before midnight still, I woke up in the darkness thinking it was a new day. I checked Catherine's unread message and realized I was wrong. Did I dreamed something today? I know I did. I thought about mentioning. Yeah, school. Something about a dance? It was grade school, again, but I wasn't a child. I stepped down the stairs in some type of costume. Was it a festival? I saw several of the girls I've known wearing red dresses. Other were in a suit, gray slacks and a fitted cocktail coat. Was Catherine among them?

I fed Nymeria and came out to the living room. My grandmother was cutting fruits or vegetables for her drink. There was no burritos, yet. I sat tired in the couch. Thinking about the day. The party of Diego would not start until three and a half. I ate the two burritos my grandma made me. My mother left for school. Grannie offered me another two, and I accepted, but ate only one.

Nymeria was tired of running and playing and started falling asleep on my lap. Or was it her cushion? I thought about going to the room and sleeping some more.

I woke up two hours later. Was it noon? Something like that. I showered and changed. I put on the black blouse with the white vest.

I was ready for leaving. I could buy the bag or something for the gift on the way. When would it be too early? When would it be too late? I waited until the appointed time on the Facebook event to leave home. I bought the gift bag and drove to her house. I stepped down and went to the front door. I called her on whatsapp and then to her phone. After a couple of minutes I decided to return to my car and wait.

She called me back and told me she would open the door. I stepped in and everyone was home already, helping in the kitchen. I felt a little embarrassed about coming this late. On my way up I had seen Carlos, Diego's father putting on the decoration in the room under the building.

It wasn't long until Catherine arrived as well. There was some of Paola's friends. I approached Carlos' cheek when he said hello. He knows about me, I guess. Paola told her mom "Sofia got here", I guess she knows, too.

Her childhood friend?

Like when I saw my patient, as we were playing that game were you have to guess what is written on the paper in your forehead only using yes or no questions, Carlos hesitated before addressing me.

It was Jessica's turn to play, but she approached him to put the paper on his forehead and he said: "No, it's hi...her turn"

They correct themselves. Shouldn't that be good enough?

I took out the phone just moments before the game would end. Catherine sent me a text asking me what I was doing minutes later.

"I don't feel good. Anxiety, maybe?" She replied how she was just thinking about leaving herself. We both said our goodbyes.

We both got into Cathy's car and she took me to mine. We used to do that when we were in College. Sometimes we would park on different parts of the lot, and we'd go to the closest car, or usually hers and stay and chat. Then, when the time to leave would come, she would take me to my car and each of us would go their way.

I talked to myself on my way home. At first I rehearsed the speech I would give about being trans. How it wasn't really something I've known my whole life. But I didn't really changed my gender. Will somebody some day ask me about it? Do I want to?

I wished no one could see or notice. I wished it would be actually a secret that I could keep and just disclose to the people I want.

I am just six months on hormones. And from here on, I will be changing more and more.

Time will pass.

## 2016-10-27

So today. Since yesterday I've known that I would take Miguel to his school. I woke up by six in the morning to feed Nymeria. I took her outside like all of the mornings. My mom was still upstair getting ready. Only females were in the house. Do I count myself? I hesitated before writing the sentence. Nymeria and me, my mother and grandmother.

I don't recall dreaming something. I slept maybe six hours. Grannie still hadn't made breakfast.

Like ten times today, my grandma has called me son. Every time is harder and more painful. I don't understand why can't I say something or correct her. A burning rage is boiling in my guts. I want to say something, scream...

It's not her fault, it's not on purpose. My mother had corrected her before.

It doesn't matter.

I stayed awake for some minutes in the couch waiting for the time to come and take Miguel to school. Nymeria was running and playing and, as usual, came to my legs and fell asleep. Nothing happened, I guess.

My mother is talking about her colleague, the one who was jealous of me in Facebook, the one with mommy issues. I hear them and feel, I don't know... It's like if they were girls in middle school talking about giving the silent treatment.

Yesterday in the child party of Diego, I noticed how he is really immature. He spend half of the party in arms, being Paola's or his father's. He had the pacifier in his mouth and I didn't hear him say not a single word. By the time of the pictures he covered himself in his firefighter hat and then fell asleep before the second half.

I told Catherine how I have this weird feelings about it. I should not care about the way she raises him. It's none of my business, they're not even family.

On the way home from the party I thought about having a conversation with my ex. Again, another one.

Why do I keep dreaming about her? It's not even that we make peace or reconcile. In my dreams I see her message, I see our conversation and I'm surprised and shocked. "Why are we talking? Why are you looking for me?"

"I wished I could stop thinking about you. Why can't I let you go? It's not that I want you back. I'm sure I don't love you. I don't care about not ever seeing you again, but... what is it that I want then? I wished I could hate you, sometimes I enlist all of the things that you did or failed to do, all of the things that would made anyone tell me that I am better without you. And not even then do I wish you wrong.

I miss talking to you, knowing how you're doing, what's happening in your life and sharing mine. I miss you.

And I hate it."

I feel pathetic. I came back from Miguel's school and on the way thought about the messages that were in the conversation of the gang. Paola thanked us about being with her, accompanying her and helping. They talked about it, said that maybe Paola can help for the next party when Chevo and Jessica have a child, they talked playfully about the future. And those hopeful talks hurt this time. Even the talk about the plan for next year's, even the wedding of Andrea.

I, hopefully, won't be close for them.

It's sure now, I've applied. The plan is set. I will go to the capital in three months. It can either be for two years or for a couple of months. Would it be a failure not getting in and coming back? Would I look for a job if I don't get into any of the masters?

How would I feel with myself?

I should not think about that. Even in the couple of months I am supposed to be there I can deal with the papers and change my name. Just doing that would be a victory and an accomplishment.

Step by step. Sometimes it doesn't help to look at the full picture. Everything as it comes.

What's the point of asking to myself: "Will I make it?", if I haven't even finished the first steps. Take each thing one at a time.

My mother brought something that I had left behind. Last night before going to bed, she came and told me how the principal of Luis school's told her he talked to his school psychologist about "doubts about his sexuality".

Did I write about this yesterday?

Am I repeating myself?

Am I trapped in yet another cycle of anxious rumination?

## 2016-10-28

I think it was a week ago, when Catherine first told me she had thought about going out today. Yesterday I think I wrote how my grandma called me "son" like 20 times. There was something that made me feel like shit as the day began. Nymeria barked at me and the lights were still off, the Sun itself was still off. It was too early still to feed her, yet I had not the patience and fed her anyway. Even I ate and took my pills.

I wasn't out of my room for more than three minutes when my grandma addressed me as M'son. Irritated, "I am not 'son'", I exclaimed and walked away. I think she did not hear me. Less than five minutes later she called me the same way again. She laughed just after. Was she because she realized her mistake? Or was it something completely different related to the thing she wanted to tell me in the first place?

I don't know and I won't ask.

Tomorrow the weekend will begin. I'm home after going out with Catherine. Miguel is asleep on the couch next to the one where I'm sitting. My grandma is doing something in the kitchen while Nymeria observes carefully.

I've given the big blouse I bought mistakenly in a Large size. More than a blouse it's a tunic, but similar to the red flannel shirt I wore today.

Yesterday when we were thinking and planning what we could do today, she proposed going to the Plaza between our homes, the one with the fun park and the mini-golf and the Bowling. In the morning I tried to go back to bed after finishing the last episode of Black Mirror. Nymeria stayed for a while in her bed-box and I could sleep. I dreamed about something, there I was in a car driven by my father. Out of home, the closest under-bridge was different. It was a sort of rock tunnels, deep, complicated and narrow. After there, I was with Catherine wandering in an indoors Mall, going through different stores. I was wearing a red dress and felt vulnerable. Some time later, we ended in the line for a bathroom.

I woke up. The darkness trapped between the closed doors made it even more difficult to stay awake and get up. Catherine had sent me a message that she'd have to go to the United States to the bank and take some money out of the ATM. She explained that we would not need to cancel our plans.

I wasn't conscious enough to even worry. I got out of the bed and went to the bathroom to get ready. I put on the black jeggings and the red flannel shirt. Almost the same outfit I wore to the University.

She would pick me up by three. When I got out of the shower she was already at her home. As she picked me up she told me how she would have to go first to an AT&T to pay her bill and from there we could go to the restaurant. She told me if I wanted to go to the movies, River Plaza, we could see the Dr Strange movie.

We went to the cell place and an employee welcomed us at the front door. Everyone today used feminine pronouns. She drove to the Plaza and we got into the Giusseppi's. The waiter sat us and after a while came for our order. We asked four all of our dishes before the drinks. As he finished taking our order he stayed and looked straight at me with a smile on his face and opened his mouth to ask me something. I cringed and waited for the worst.

"Are you, it's your voice, when you spoke, I mean, are you still a lady? Because, I mean, you look young, but your voice sounds deep and..."

I smiled uncomfortable and just mumbled yes. Catherine answered back that, yeah, I'm young despite my voice.

He brought us our food and everything went fine. We walked through different stores and looked at stuff waiting for our movie. We would be seeing it in 4D.

In the movie theater, getting up the escalator I watched a woman climbing the stairs. I moved to the side so she could pass. After some moments she took the cue and walked past us. "Thank you, girls", she said. Then, as she ordered her Tostitos and I stood in line for a bottle of water, the man behind me, told to his wife "I'm behind her (esta)... After her, then it's me."



## 2016-10-29

I don't remember the last time I sat here in my desk and typed the words. Is it more than a week?

The laptop has been having issues. I broke Miguel's can shaped glass because of it. I feel guilty about it. I was with him when he bought it. I imagined how I would feel had he broken my Mason mug. Nymeria is running with her giraffe on her mouth. I took her out of the desk irritated after dealing with the problematic laptop.

Maybe I should make use of the opportunity and play with her. Maybe that could help me with my mood.

I went outside and ran with her. We ran besides each other. I ran behind her trying to reach her. I ran ahead and made her bark when she could not follow my steps. I ended exhausted and sitting on the floor. I was sweating when came back inside and lied on the couch to catch my breath.

Edgar and his friends would come any moment. I heard the voice of my mother mention his name. Luis came down the stairs almost immediately. "My mom says that you go and open the door to Edgar and tell him to put the car on the visits' parking space" I went to my purse for the keys and felt a sudden pulse of anxiety in my spine. What if they see me? What will they say or think? They will recognize me and think I'm a weirdo or a faggot.

I gave him the keys. "You go". He asked me to accompany him. "You go, why do you want me?" "I don't know what to say to him." I gave him no answer and went to my room. I heard their voices get closer and closer. I was trapped, again, in my room. Some minutes passed before I took the courage to open the door and go outside. Edgar said hi. I approached him with my hand extended, but he hugged me. His friends, one was sitting in the table and the other one was in the restroom. When he came out he just saw me and smiled cordially.

They came to the Oktoberfest. I caught the word in their conversation and remembered last week that I could not go. Didn't they know?

I opened my mouth and turned my thoughts to words. They were sure they had read it was supposed to be the 29th. After some laughs and reconsideration of their plans, they decided to go to the Plaza.

Miguel is there right now as well. We were in the mail when he told my dad he was going to go out this evening. He and his friends would meet at the house in La Cacho and from there would they go to The Plaza in front of Plaza Rio.

The line wasn't long but it was tedious. We were like 20 cars behind the booth when it stopped completely for 10 or 15 minutes. I started thinking what could happen when we reached the officer, what kind of questions would they ask or comments. Would he made a mention about me?

Cars started passing and advancing. And then, somehow, we stopped at the booth and the officer was a woman and for a moment I was relieved. As if a woman was less probable to take offense about my being. She took the cards and made the usual questions while she reviewed the pictures in them. She paired the pictures silently one by one. I knew the order of the credentials because I was the one that took them out of their sleeves and passed them to my dad. Dad, Mom, me and brothers. She looked at my dad and from there passed to my mom. It was my turn and her face turned to the seats of the back. I was the one closest to the window and to her. She passed the cards and asked Luis to move back to see Miguel. She saw all of the three cards confused. Then she asked out loud. "Jose?" And I raised my hand as if confessing a shameful crime. "You are?" and then said the names of my brothers and just let us go.

We ate at Denny's. From there my dad took us to Target where the bill surpassed the five hundred dollars. I bought a purple top and a dark red blouse. I tried some formal pants but none fit. My mom asked me how the make up turned out. I told him it was alright. And she asked back if I needed anything else from there. I said no, but then ended up buying a lip pencil, mascara and a concealer.

I took a picture of my red lips matching the blouse. I see me smiling and remembered me imagining how would I look when I transitioned.

This is the picture of me at 6 months of hormones. This is me.

And even as I type this, I can't help but smile again.

## 2016-10-30

And so another day is close to ending. Just one day for one more month to pass. Two more and the year is over. A week after its beginning did I finally call to make the hormones appointment. Here I am thinking, planning, preparing for the next step of my life. My master, my change of name are the things that are ahead.

Tomorrow would be the day that Anahi and Catherine would go to the United States in costume to, I don't know, do something. I wanted to go, I want to. I see everybody's pictures of them in disguise and I feel envious. It's scary just to think about crossing the border. Catherine is right. She told me how she can imagine what I feel or fear. It's crossing with papers with another name and appearance, to somebody whose job is specifically to assess and judge me.

I had decided not going. And some hours ago Catherine sent a message telling me how they had changed their minds and instead would go to the Macro Plaza at night. She would be asking to leave early, but would see us maybe by 9.

I woke up in the early morning, an hour before time for Nymeria's feeding. I turned off the lights again ignoring her. It was way to early. I went and returned from slumber. After feeding I opened the door and carried her with the intention of not waking any of our house guests. Did I sleep again after that?

I remember hearing their voices and my mother and grandma preparing breakfast. I opened the door and headed out, dreading my grandma's "son" callings. Would I look suspicious in my pajamas? They are not overtly feminine.

Nobody said anything about it. I sat and ate with them.

The chatted at the table after finishing their plates. I, on the other hand, moved to the couch putting some distance between me and them. Andres is the name of the taller one. His hair is lighter and longer. El Pollo is the oldest and shortest of them. He's the teacher. Elementary school is where he works.

They talked about school and dealing with a special kid. The talked about the gym and the breakfast, their age and appearances. When they mentioned the beards I noticed something. El Pollo, doesn't grow a beard. He doesn't even need to shave according to them. He's young looking and mistaken for a child sometimes. They told about the time when the three of them were 22 but seen as 28, 22 and 14, respectively.

His body is gynecoid in form. He has wide hips and a voluminous behind compared to the rest of his body. His hips are actually wider than his shoulders. Does he have an hormone imbalance? That would be actually really probable. I thought about mentioning to my mother, but decided against it. What's the point?

If they did notice about me, he was the one most probable to have clocked me. When they left, Edgar hugged me but I extended my hand to them.

I thought about starting grading the tests today. It's ten o'clock and I have barely even opened the folder with the tests.

Tomorrow I guess I'll go out with both Catherine and Anahi. I don't have to worry about the costume anymore. I don't have to worry.

I should had done the tests. Instead I spent most of the day on the couch resting and reading. I'm a third, no, more like a fourth, behind finishing the book I've been reading. I haven't studied anything though. Maybe I go to school in the week to actually study or do something in there. I haven't gotten to familiarize with the notational app.

Melissa talked to me yesterday. In the morning she sent me a message asking how I've been. We chatted for a while about our recent lives. She's been busy and I got a little jealous. When I mention my plans it seems as if I've actually been doing something.

In paper I look busy and interesting. I've been transitioning hormonally this last year, I'm applying to these master programs, gathering the papers for the processes and studying for their tests. And I've been seeing this patients for evaluations on the side to gather some money.

Anyway, she was the first person outside Anahi and family that I told about leaving in february to the Capital. She told me how she knows this person who works in a NGO that deals with trans people. She thought about mentioning me so I could participate in a forum or something. It would be really cool.

I agreed with her and told her I was in.

Would this actually lead to something? Or will it be like those patients that say they're interesting but I never heard of them?

## 2016-10-31

I'm all dressed up and ready. I should go upstairs and tell my parents I'm about to leave. We're going to Macroplaza to get a coffee or drink something. Maybe TGI Friday's or Applebees or something like that. Why am I nervous? I won't have to go through Customs border nor any CBP officers. Nobody is going to judge my appearance.

I think I'll order an uber. Anahi and I will meet before Catherine, although she's going to check out in less than an hour.

I'm Batgirl, but brunette. I started grading some tests and put the first episode of Chance, where House is a neuropsychiatrist called Chance. I didn't finish it.

I woke up early and fed Nymeria. After the usual early mornin routine I went back to sleep and she went straight to her box. A couple of hours later I woke up and ate my breakfast. Then, after seeing yesterday's episode of Westworld I slept some more. I was tired, I still am.

I didn't send the message to my patient confirming tomorrow's meeting. I don't know at what hour I'll see her. It's still early. I could send a message right now or even tomorrow morning.

I put on some make up, even eye shadow. I sent a picture to both Catherine and Anahi, the latter told me I looked good, a little thinner.

I don't know what else to write. It's like the last few days have been slimmer or voider.

Should I cheat right now? Tomorrow I would have to write double.

I've ran out of ideas and I'm not even halfway. I could take a picture of myself and post it to Facebook. That's what I wanted to do, didn't I?
That's the whole point. I wanted to show myself, to be seen and do what everybody else has been doing. I want to be social and do something.

I opened up my cellphone and went to instagram. Did I had her in mind before I opened the app or was her thought a kind of reflex? I looked at her profile. Catherine told me some weeks ago that her profile keeps showing up in the list of people she might know, her latest posts as well. I got there and saw her latest post. She looks different. It's not like she has changed. I just recognized her less and less every time. She is reclined on some kind of fence wearing a short brown sweater. "I have no tits" is the description of her picture.

Do I have more than her? Was that the intention of her only question when I told her I would start Hormone Treatment? Envy? Fear that I, somehow, would end up more feminine than her? No. I don't think it's that.

The phone has vibrated. I guess it's Anahi telling me she's ready.

I am nervous and a little scared.

I cheated but returned to actually finished the words. It wasn't my phone that vibrated. I guess it was Luis'. I've gone upstairs and told them how I would be leaving in some minutes. It's going to be eight o'clock. It is eight now. Will it be too late when we get there? What if it is too dangerous? I won't be taking my car. I'll ask for an uber. Myabe on the way home Catherine could take me? No, I guess she's going to be tired. I could just ask for another uber back. My phone should be charged enough. She'll be leaving in a couple of minutes. Maybe we'll get there by the same time. Why should things go wrong? Why am I still worried or thinking about the chances of something going foul?

I ought to calm down. I wanted this, I asked for this.

Everything is going to be alright. The words are done and I even did some exercises on Khan Academy to maintain the streak.

I wish Catherine wouldn't have to work, that she could had come with us since the beginning. Am I just envious? Why did I have to accept going out? I had cancelled already. Anahi is ready. Maybe I should go now?

It is still early. I know where will we be going but I don't know what we're going to do. It's hard going out the three of us because I worry that ANahi is not having a good time. I don't know what she wants to do and she doesn't give options. When we decide and do something I don't know if she's enjoying herself. Maybe I am a little nervous because of that. It's going to be just the two of us for a while.



## 2016-11-01

For a minute here I thought yesterday's words had not been saved. I saw the last empty box below the month of October and my heart skipped a beat. Could it be again that I would lose unintentionally the streak of more than a hundred days? Again all this effort thrown away, even after all I went through yesterday, cheating and then working up to the quota in the time before my parting.

After refreshing the page and returning I saw the complete set of the 31 checked boxes. And in this white page, up there rests the 30 next empty yet-to-be-filled white squares.

Do I write about yesterday's night or today's day?

I left home when Anahi told me to meet in the plaza just minutes after Catherine sent a message that she was off her shift. I wore my costume outside my home. This was the third time that I was disguised with the black skirt outside my home and the first time that I was seen in it by the people that live with me.

I waited outside for the red Uber car to pick me up. There were groups of people supervising children marching in their disguises door to door in the look for candies. Some saw me; other's sights stayed in me for longer. A mother passed and left behind a "good afternoon".

The car arrived and took me to my destination. I was earlier and I waited. I hide my face in my phone in the conversation with Anahi. I walked towards the Starbucks, our meeting place. I decided not to enter yet. The two closest benches were occupied so I walk to the third. To a side there was a Torta restaurant guarded by person inside a big Torta costume. I sat and he looked at me, although I could not see his eyes. He got closer and closer until he was just by my side. A kid approached us and extended his hand to salute him. He answer his call and return his pretended face towards me. In an awkward state of nervousness I invited him to sit. He took my invitation. More and more children came and surrounded us. One mother asked me if his son could take pictures with him. I guess she thought I was with him. I stood and after a couple of minutes and children, I left.

Anahi got there and ordered a coffee with me. Mine was a tea and hers a green frappe. We were chatting about stuff and our lives and looking at the people in their disguises, when a group of teenagers wearing a white mask came to the glass behind us and stayed there observing. We glanced at them but tried to stay in our conversation. Another two people from their group stood beside them and took a picture with a camera. Moments later, they left.

Catherine arrived some time later.

We went to the Alitas and later Applebee's. The night end and everyone went home. I changed my profile picture.

Today I woke up and stayed awake. I fed Nymeria and then ate what my grandma made for me. She prepared three burritos but I left one that I would later eat on my way home from the session.

I met Paola in the University. I got there first and walked around the faculty. At first I felt exposed and nervous. There is almost nobody there that knows or could even recognize me. There were no stands in the building and I sat in the bench of the Language faculty. I felt this ache in my insides, a discomfort that crunched my guts. Paola called me and told me she was on her way. We saw Eddhy in the conference room and told us how there would be no stands but a conference at two in the afternoon.

We drank a cup of coffee and chatted in the Circle. Like yesterday I gave my name to be called when the order were ready. This time I was called. Time passed and I told her about my departure and plans. She talked about her classes.

I left and met with my patient. This was the last session of test applications. We didn't agree on a meeting for next week.

I got home and I've been talking with Melissa and Catherine. Melissa told me that she has said my name to the contact of the organization so I should be ready if somebody adds me or sends me a message.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene before the meeting.

There is the pain again. I'm tired.

## 2016-11-02

Day of the Dead. I met with Rene earlier than usual. He sent me a text yesterday afternoon telling me how they had just told him that the building would close at noon and ask me if he could set my appointment at 10 in the morning instead. I agreed. I would go out anyway, I had a meeting today in the office. "Office"... it's not an office, it's a clinic, a private clinic where I am a consultant, a freelancing evaluator.

Anyway, I could not think about something to talk about. I mumbled about my vulnerability and the changes that mark the difference between before or the barely beginning of hormone treatment and now, six months later. How being referred as him by a friend of my patient just moments before of being introduced as Sofia was a hit enough on my self-image, even though she corrected herself almost immediately after.

I mentioned the occurrence with the waiter and his question about if I was still a miss. "He noted and mentioned my voice", I told him. Do I have to hide it? Is it something that I should be ashamed of?

I woke up with Nymeria and fed her. This morning I went looking for breakfast and realized later that I was the only person awake. Neither my parents or brothers would go to work or school. My grandma had no reason to get up and prepare breakfast. They probably didn't even know that I would be leaving. I wanted to return to bed, hide under the warm blankets and rest my head on the pillow and my mind in my dreams.

Did I dream something? It's like I could feel the distant memories of a different reality. There was something about being naked and looking for a bathroom. I woke up before dawn and went to the restroom.

I showered just after getting completely awake and conscious. I left Nymeria in my room and could hear her hurting barks from the shower. Even after an absence of half an hour, my return to my room is celebrated by excited hops and energetic barks.

Just know I have her sitting on my lap with her head resting on the desk between my forearms. I see her round big black eyes hidden in her white thin fur and the warm of her body over mine begs me to embrace her and keep her close and smell her and kiss her. I don't think I've ever felt this kind of love and affection for another living being. It's different from all the kinds of love that I've experienced. Not greater or lesser, just different. I don't own her, I am not her mistress or her mother like Catherine and my mom says. She cares for me and I do for her. Even after just a couple of months living with her I don't want to think about my leaving the city, my leaving her behind.

Leaving Rene's office I drove straight to Liliana's. I got there a quarter of an hour late but the dr had not arrived. The dr never arrived.

In the Whatsapp groups there was a talk about a reunion to organize the exchange of gifts and the meeting before the holidays. In another conversation Paola told me how she posted on one of her groups and there was two or three people interested in the coursework that I've been planning.

I didn't want to let myself get excited. I had considered doing it and planning it. I wanted to and had the intentions. There is no place available, no option... I shared my worries and she resolved them in a matter of seconds. The hall where she did her son's party is available, she could reserve it. I would only need to bring the chairs and tables.

We kept talking about it and she showed me the post, she posted about different tests that they don't see in their syllabus and an excel program for the MMPI. I have all of the things she offered. The programs are ready, the tests I know and I've applied. Why do I feel reserved about it? Charging five hundred pesos would give me an approximate of four thousand in profits in a group of ten. Two thousand would be a modest expectation.

What am I waiting for? I told Rene I feel overwhelmed with the guide of the application exam and now the evaluation of my patient and now this course. I have lots of things to do. Gilda asked me if the girl contacted me, and that she would talk to her. Melissa told me yesterday how she recommended me to the Trans organization for the forum.

Isn't that what I wanted? Having things to do?

How is it that now I just want to lie down and rest. Even after I slept most of the afternoon?


## 2016-11-03

We were sitting in a stone bench outside the Burger King, in front of the Bol-Bol, the bowling place where we had planned about going but didn't. I had my phone in my hands and in its screen appeared a news article that I noticed from Facebook. 9 trans murders in Tijuana, was titled. In it, several sentences proclaimed the same idea: Men that transition from men to women. Trans women are men. They are seen by men by the police and the journalist keep referring to them, to us, as just that.

I have lost count of the times that I've thought how would it be being killed in a hate crime. Once by the pistol or knife of the killer, another by the article in the paper where they mentioned me as a cross-dressing male, a third one in the mass that I don't want where the priest mentions the name which I was born with and outgrown, and finally in the tombstone where eternally would be written a name that doesn't corresponds. How many times will I be assassinated?

Itayee, was she a friend of Telma's, sent me a message in the afternoon asking me to like a picture of her dog for a contest. Generally I ignored those kind of messages, but this time I looked at the picture and actually liked it. I did and complimented her on her dog. The conversation kept going asking how's everything been going and those kind of questions. Just moments ago, when she asked me about my job, she continued asking if it would be viable or possible for me to see her. I grabbed the agenda and remembered how I should be filling it. It's several months now that I am behind. The black one I bought with Catherine in the gift shop of the university was forgotten by its middle.

Anyway, the date is set. I'll see her in two weeks. Next one I'll finish with the current patient. In yesterday's meeting, Gilda mentioned me that she would communicate with her contact about her interest of Vocational Orientation.

I woke up and took Nymeria to her plate and outside. Everything went as normal. My grandma told me there was a burrito aside for me. It wasn't just one but two. My mother and brothers had already left. I thought it was just the two of us and the dog. I was mistaken.

Did I fell asleep before or after? No, I did and I was awake again when I left the room and heard steps on the stairs. It was my dad. What was he doing here? He opened the door and went outside. Would he leave? Did he went to work in the night? I heard the sound of a car accelerating and turning on and off. I looked outside and noticed it was my car. He was helping with it. I stepped outside and looked at him and what was he doing.

He asked me if I would go out today. I told him that in the afternoon. And so I did. I showered and changed. I wore the red blouse with strings on the neck. Catherine picked me up after finishing her session. We went to the bank first, I think. I waited in the car while she went to the ATM. It was in there that I answered Itayee's message. I got another notification, Medrano had commented on one of my pictures. I was scared, actually. I thought lots of possible things he could say that would make me really uncomfortable. But he didn't. He was nice. He just posted how he loves going to comic-con because of how you space out of reality for some days.

She paid her cable and we went to the Supermarket. I bought Nymeria's harness and leash. We went to the Giusseppi's in the Plaza of Fun World. For a while we considered leaving the restuarant. I thought they were ignoring us on purpose. Two girls sitting together, were we on a date? Or maybe it was the "guy in girl's clothes". The waiter came and everything went fine.

We played mini-golf and actually had lots of fun. We even bought some tokens and played some videogames. I had lots of fun playing Ms Pac-man and she did with skeeball.

Tomorrow she'll bring MuÃ±eca here and we'll take the dogs outside to meet each other. She'll take Nymeria home and care for her for the weekend. Will I miss her? How will I do? How will she?

## 2016-11-04

Catherine has Nymeria by now. I woke up half an hour before the time I feed her. I saw the watch but ignored Nymeria's cries. It was early. I turned off the lights and fell asleep for another 30 minutes. She stayed quiet as well, maybe she slept, too. I fed her and took her outside. There was a nice chilly wind. It's frustrating how the cold just last a couple of hours in the morning and then the Sun comes by noon and makes everything hot and uncomfortable. The switching temperatures give my allergies another opportunity to bother me.

I showered and put on male skinny jeans. I don't have hips yet, but my thighs are wider and there is a narrowing in my waist just below my breasts. It was hard pulling the pants up. I was going to start shaving when Nymeria's cries were louder and more frequent. I won't sleep with her for the first time since I took her home. I came down and let her accompany me to the bathroom upstairs. I shaved while she barked by my feet.

I saw Catherine's picture of her and MuÃ±eca. She was wearing a wonder woman t-shirt. The one of her costume. I thought we could match. The Superman t-shirt was in my closet. I could wear it. I would be wearing just male clothes.

I told Rene how they bother me less these last few days. Maybe it's because they don't make me look completely like a man. I outgrown them, they don't fit the same way, my changes are more obvious than them.

I put it on, but I see enough of the person that I was that I changed my mind and took it off. I'm wearing the green blouse that I had picked yesterday.

The luggage is ready. I put in there the pijama I wore this morning, the black jeggings that I plan to wear tomorrow and the black blouse with the white vest. Coming home I can either shower again and get ready or just change blouse to go and meet my friends in the evening. In the bag I put my sandals and the black flats as well. On top are the bags of cosmetics and make up. The only thing that's missing is a towel.

In the morning Ana Ascencio liked my Profile Picture. Does she recognize me as that student of hers? That one friends with Hilda, and the one that was walking once near Downtown with that friend. Does she know I am trans?

I thought about sending Medrano a message. A heads up. "So... what you think? Did you see this coming?"

No. I was nervous enough when I got his notification. I won't tease the bull if I know I won't handle its horns.

The red dress is hanging from the upper door of my closet. My face is already made up. I won't do anything to my hair. I am almost ready. There's like two hours left for my mom to arrive. Catherine is right, I got ready very early.

Am I nervous about the party? I've seen several of my uncles and aunts. Most of them added me on Facebook and are cool about me. They have seen pictures of me in dresses, there are the ones where I wore the black long dress and my face even fuller of make up than now.

Will there be some comments or questions? Is the dress appropriate? What about my cousins? Should I extend my cheek to the male ones or just wait for their initiative? What about the younger ones? Will they recognize me or ask about me? "Weren't you a boy?" "Why are you dressed like that? Are you gay?".

No, everything will be alright. My nose is running and every time that I touch it with my finger I think I take the make up off. Getting ready from now wasn't such a good idea. At least I know now how to put it on. This is the third time that I've put eyeshadow. The first one was barely noticeable. The second one was more obvious but still hidden behind either my glasses or a mask. This time is fuller and more colorful. I took a picture and sent it to Catherine.

Having this much make up makes me uncomfortable. I'm afraid about looking like a drag queen. I'm scared of seeing my male features through the colors and make up. I don't want to look like Ivan. I don't want people to think of him when they see me.

I don't want no one to remember that name.

## 2016-11-05

Since the last words, nothing has changed. Or, more correctly, everything is the same again. I'm sitting in the same chair and Nymeria is running in my room.

My profile picture is a new one different to the one of me wearing a bat-girl costume. That one has a little more than 50 likes. What are likes? I mean, I'm writing this to myself. I know what they are. Will I remember? Which me am I addressing this to?

It doesn't matter. Fifty people looked at my picture and spent a little more than a second making proof of their approval of my picture. It seems kind of, pathetic. Giving meaning to a single click. But even then, if it's nothing, what about the people who didn't?

I see pictures of Omar and Valeria. They are Monica's friends. She appears on the list of people who have given their respective click under their pictures almost every time. I thought about Monica when I saw the most recent picture I uploaded and the ones my mother did. The profile picture is public by definition. Everyone, absolutely anyone can see it. She is unblocked, so she can type my name in the search bar and that picture will appear. The rest won't. Just that one and the previous ones. But my mother uploaded more from yesterday. They are still friends. She doesn't have to even remember my name to see those. They will suddenly appear on her screen if she hasn't hidden my mom. And she will see me in the red dress and with red lips. Will she?

She won't. I think about her a thousand times more than she does about me.

We got to Mexicali by 8 in the afternoon. We arrived directly at the party. My aunt welcomed me with a hug and complimented me. Most of the women who know me did. Men were different. They seemed uncomfortable by my image. No, they didn't. It was just my aunt's husband. He extended his hand to me and I could sense repulse from his face. The kids were something else. Didn't they recognize me? My cousins said hi without mentioning my name or anything, it was as if nothing had changed at all. My nephews didn't acknowledge me. They said hi to my parents and my brothers, and the passed me. Maybe they didn't see me, maybe they did but didn't know me. Maybe they did but didn't know what to do. Or what to think. I noticed their eyes. I didn't know how to feel, so I felt nothing. I ordered sangria. Then later that night I ordered Kahlua. The dinner was chicken and pasta. Both of them had cheese.

I didn't dance. I missed Catherine. I could had brought her. I was exchanging messages with her and the thought came up. Would I introduce her as my girlfriend? I am not only transgender, I am homosexual as well.

To some theorists, me liking women doesn't make me homosexual and that, ironically, makes me less trans as well.

They might see it that way. That I have a girlfriend makes me "less abnormal".

I didn't noticed at first. I did hear her but, I don't know, the words didn't register or I paid no attention. It wasn't until my aunt Armida came that I heard her consciously: "And this here is Sofia" "I finally meet you", she answered with a chuckle.

She introduced me to her family. I could see it under a benevolent perspective and think how she's acknowledging me and showing her support, her standing behind me. Or I could see it as she thinking I am somebody different to the person who I was.

The party ended an hour and a half after midnight.

Today we had breakfast at the pancake house. In the morning they mentioned something about going to a buffet in a casino. They weren't kidding. On the way there I felt nervous about being asked my id and having to bear a fuss about the discrepancy of appearances. When I passed under the metal detector and the lady asked me for my credential my heart skipped a beat. I showed it to her without taking it out of my wallet. She looked at it and inspect her. Her eyes were different when they returned from the card to my face. She said nothing. There was 17 minutes left of the buffet, so we left.

The plan was that we would return by noon. There would be time, except there wasn't.

We waited for Edgar to congratulate him on his birthday. We visited my uncle and we arrived to Tijuana an hour after the time I was supposed to meet my friends. Irving said my name when he hugged me. His girlfriend greeted me, does she know? Everyone said my name and used feminine pronouns except my uncle when he said good bye. Did Ivan slipped him or was it intentional?

Should it matter?

I feel anxious and restless. I feel like screaming.

Just now I feel like crying.

Last night in was the daytime change. Is that how it's written? We delayed the clocks an hour. It's not something new, it's done every year.

I felt, something, last night. I remember crying in my bed under the sheets. I hit Nymeria after she did something. She stayed quiet after that. I feel it's really late but it's barely 8 in the afternoon. The day started later than usual. Or is it earlier? I had one more hour of sleep and dreams. I dreamed a lot today. Nymeria woke me even later than usual as if she knew my mind was busy.

The first dream was a kind of a compilation. There were different sequences of stuff that I don't remember. One of them I ran from a chase of two identical people. Then I turned into two as well. One of me was killed, stabbed, by them, and the other grabbed their keys and took off with their car or bike or something. It wasn't me me. I was a guy and my appearance was different. Inside my dream I woke up in a theater sitting with known people, one of them was Chevo, to whom I asked about the themes of the movies. As I suspected it, the themes were related to my dreams.

We were walking in some kind of school, I recognized the terrain and buildings of my jr high. There were several people walking amongst us, like those times when I would start classes and walk through the front door towards my classroom. It was late at night as the skies were a dark gray. The people surrounding us suddenly were all wearing red robes with hoods that covered their faces. And then, an orange light flashed around me. Heated flames embraced my body and another flash blinded me. I woke up. It was 5 in the morning. Was it the new or the old time?

I slept again and entered to another different dream. It was more complex and real. I was in some kind of ship, was it underwater? There was some kind of sense of urgency. It was drowning. The danger was known, as of a sounding alarm blaring, or was it some kind of hidden threat? I looked out for an exit. Another theme in that dream was the idea of fake realities. The boat was real but, like matrix, reality was disguised in a simulation. In it I was playing some kind of videogame, like those arcade machines of an era before mine. The activities in the game played as another layer of the dream. Around me there were several other people, were they children? Was I a child? Was I a boy or a girl? I remember wearing something like a red dress.

I told Catherine how a girl of those came closer to me and almost brushed her body against mine. There was a thought or feeling that I've never experienced before. It was doubt, doubt of her intentions, was she trying to be affectionate? She rested her head on my shoulder and I wanted her there. Did she know I was a girl? Was it wrong? It felt, abnormal, weird. Not the sensation itself but what could be seen. I never really stopped ant thought about being gay.

Then, another dream was an old woman, a scientist with an investigator or journalist or something. She explained the simulation, the reality. She explained about me, the child. I was her creation. I was the core personality and root memories of her late partner. She was a biologist or computer scientist or something. She was the creator of a Neural net computing simulation. She was explaining it about her wife, she was a psychologist, her first work was titled the Genetic basis of memories, attitudes and behavior. Nobody took her serious, she was a woman, she was trans, and her discoveries contradicted everything known in the field. Until they met, and with the woman's work, they proved in the DNA and neural structure was embedded the core personality and memories of people. With that knowledge she was able to preserve the person whom she loved in this new child, their savior.

The journalist was something related to Monica. That part I skipped to Catherine. Was she her herself? Why was she still young? What importance would it have my person to a Monica's relative?

"So, your wife, she was Sofia" was the revelation that would culminate in the dream. Except it didn't got to that. I woke up. That reality, that story, that tale came to a finish and it extinguished leaving nothing but fractured and expiring memories that are cursed to fade away.

It's been several days now that I waited for these elections today. It's not my country, I don't live there. Although I live in the border, in the near future I probably will be moving further away from this neighbor nation. Why am I this worried? Yeah, neither of both candidates were optimal. Both had their deficiencies. I'm glad I didn't have to cast a vote to either of them. Yet, everything on play is important to me, to people like me.

It's not that I fear Trump. He is a fear-mongering, mysoginist, homophobe and islamophobe. His vice-president, Pence, is a bigger and more concrete threat. He is a religious conservative who thinks homosexuality is a disease that can be cured. I don't even want to imagine or infer his thoughts on transgender people. There are two vacant places for justices on the Supreme Court. The republicans own the Senate and Congress. They'll appoint people who align with their beliefs. Their changes of policy on SRS surgeries, HRT and Informed Consent should not matter to me. I am on my treatment. Foreign policies on Trans treatment don't matter on here. Discrimination, on the other hand, do. North Caroline and several "red" states have these laws where they prohibit people of using a bathroom of the other gender of their birth certificates. What does that mean to me? What will happen when I cross the border to go shopping? What will happen to me when I'd need to use the restroom or a fitting room? Will they respect my papers?

I woke up in the early morning and fed Nymeria half an hour earlier. I forgot to fed her last night. She was asleep and I didn't want to wake her. When I realized it was two hours after her meal-time. I decided to let her sleep.

My father had told me to get up early and accompany him to take the car to the shop. He would take my brothers to school and return for me.

He did. I didn't change. I just put on a hoodie and went upstairs to shave the excessive facial hair. I drove the jetta following him. He took me through some strange paths. Worried that the car would stop, I tried not to desaccelerate suddenly. Various cars would get between us and slow down. I almost lost him three times. One, in the freeway, I missed the exit because of a van.

We got to the shop and I left the car. I felt the sights of the mechanics on me even though I was far away. I went to the pick up trying to hide myself but it was closed. My father returned and drove me home. He tried to make some chit chat just before arriving. He mentioned the elections. He asked me about my application. When I made a comment about staying in the capital for the times of the application, he didn't seem much convinced. I didn't want to continue talking. I feared we would make that comment about surviving by myself, maintaining me, being self-sufficient without his help.

I got here and slept. I've slept a grand fraction of the day, I graded just one of the four tests I was supposed to interpret today. I am so tired.

"Do I bother you?"
"Not that word"

"Why didn't you want to go out today?"

Was there ever plans for today? It was the weekend I think or was it yesterday? I asked her about going to the In n Out. She mentioned Friday, asking me if I had a patient for that day. No. She does. Her only off days are today and Friday until next week. She's busy. She has a job. She's successful in a way.

I am busy too, I have things to do. I have a post saved in my phone about a place where they rent offices for single therapy and courses. It's just 100 pesos for an hour. There are people interested in my offer.I have this evaluation I have to finish and another patient waiting for next week.

I feel like I reek. I don't remember the last time I showered. These last few days have been exhausting. Tomorrow I'll see Rene. The party was this friday, Catherine took care of my dog. She has only two days of rest and I, having a full list of things to do, am bed-ridden because of self-hate and depression and fear.

What is wrong with me? Why can't I bare to be happy?

## 2016-11-09

I did not notice the empty white square in the upper side of the blank page. I had finished already when I accessed to the statistics page that I finally see the lacking number of continuous days. A sudden explosion of panic made me move from my chair. Didn't I write the words the day before? I looked around in the archive that is my memory, as if I were looking for a misplaced file. "I know it's here, it has to be around here, somewhere". Something had to be wrong. There must had been a mistake. I replayed the day before on my mind, I graded the tests, I used excel, I was tired. Didn't I write them? I didn't, did I?

I felt resignation. Again, more than one hundred days thrown away. I failed. I forgot.

The three projective tests and I would redact the report today. Just four tests and I would had been done. It wasn't much to ask. It wasn't that tiring. I still failed. I interpreted one. I left the double of work for today. That was even before knowing that there would not be a meeting in the morning.

My car is still in the shop. I woke up but returned to bed. The morning was mine. I didn't even try to pretend that I would do some work in the morning. I slept and rested. By 10 in the morning I woke up again with the urge to postpone the alarm clock for more minutes. I showered without remembering the last time I did. I felt disgusting in the stench of my own body. I shaved my body and my face. There were crimson droplets of blood and the cuts of the sharp mis-strokes were well received. I embraced the pain and enjoyed it. When the alum stung as I passed it, I smiled a little.

Did I like the pain?

The uber was at the tire shop when I ordered it. He came 10 minutes later but still left me some minutes before the closing of the clock. I had things to talk about, I guess. Rene misgendered me again. Was it intentional? Was it because of the way I was dressed or my voice?

He asked me how I was dressed in the masculine way. The pain was different, it wasn't physical or enjoyable. Was it that I didn't think it was deserved? My face froze and de-inflated. Why did I try to hide my discomfort? Isn't the whole point of going to therapy the freedom of expression? Why wasn't I able to correct him? Was that his intention? Would I hate him if it were? Would I hate him less?

I asked for another uber home. Maybe tomorrow the car will be ready, probably it won't.

Catherine sent me some texts while she was at work. The last ones were where she said that we could invite Anahi somewhere tomorrow for breakfast if she had a late shift. Herself would not enter until noon. Maybe we could go to Denny's or IHOP, somewhere closer to the border.

I thought about yesterday's election. The dollar is more expensive, it has reached the 20 pesos. I don't have a car, I would need to return in the evening for my session.

She told me not to worry and continued. Anahi would prefer going out on the weekend because those are her free days, but she works those, that's why she wanted to do something in the inner week.

The only thing I kept reading was how both of them have a job where they are paid in dollars. Neither of them have to worry about the devaluation of the mexican peso, or being discriminated because of their identity. None of them have to worry about hiding themselves or live in fear because of whom they are.

And I resented them, and I hated them. And I hated the world. Most of all I hated myself. I asked her not to keep talking.

I saw the election yesterday. I watched the shows and looked for the polls. I saw the fear and anxiety in the hosts and guests. I felt it myself. I don't even live there. I can't live there. I won't be able to, anymore.

Most of the states were Red in that map. Most of the states hate me. The laws that passed to help people like me will be discarded. Today I read the news that my government didn't pass the initiative of the president asking for equal marriage. They don't support the gay community.

They kill the trans community.

I'll be alone, completely alone and vulnerable.

Maybe it's not sadness I feel, but fear.

"I see you very cheery and joyful, how are you?"

I finished with the last evaluation. I finished the report today. I went to bed last night without finishing redacting the conclusion. I trusted my self-control, hoping that I would stay up in the morning and finish it instead of returning to bed and continue sleeping. And so I did. I fed the dog and ate my own burritos. I was irritated and kind of upset about something. My grandma called me "son". And then, correcting herself, repeated "son...daughter". I acted as if I didn't hear anything. I redacted the last paragraphs and printed the whole thing. I fixed a mistake when I mistyped the objective of the Person under the rain test, so I printed that page again. There was no way for me to realize I had written the patients last name wrong.

I stayed for a while in the living room. Did I think about something? Felt something? I just remember being extremely tired. I couldn't stand there for long and I hide in bed. I put the alarm to wake me up by noon and yet I postponed it for an hour more. I showered and got ready. By now I am wearing my pajamas and have cleaned my face.

I read a post in Valeria's profile. It appeared on my feed and it was long. Why did I stayed and read it? It wasn't the first post she had published about the Trump's winning. No, the one before that was about the election, and the mexican people who posted their pride about voting over there. Monica had liked it. I didn't really agree with it. What if some mexican celebrities published about voting over there and inciting the american population to do their civic duty? I guess if they're living there and have the chance of voting it's because it's their business. I hate that absurd nationalistic pride of putting your native country before all. "How do they dare to incite the american vote when they don't do it here?"

I saw Monica's face in the little boxes under the numbers and I wondered what did she think? What was or is her opinion about all of this?

Maybe I did think about all of that when I read the post and I made my comment. I was enraged and upset and posted a comment almost as large as the post itself explaining my worry about the outcome. Would anybody read it? Would Monica? How would she feel reading my words, recognizing my speech and thoughts? Would she care?

It stayed there, and the numbers under Valeria's post kept increasing. Maybe it's hope that they want? Feeling like they have a little bit of control. Convincing themselves they have the answer and are above the masses who follow the american way.

Yesterday I asked Catherine to stop talking and most of the evening went by in silence between us. I sent her a message apologizing about my weakness and fragility. She doesn't think I am weak. Almost at the same time I confessed I am afraid of breaking in any moment.

She thinks the opposite. I asked her about it but she felt asleep. The night came and went and I read her answer in the morning.

"I feel like you have a lot inside: anger, rage, fear. That instead of becoming weak or just about to break, that is what is making you stronger. Not strong as in a fighter sense, but like though, impregnable, isolated. Maybe you are feeling like shit, I don't know, I really don't know what you feel. Every time is harder for me to reach you."

My grandma tried to make me some meat, but it was overdone and it tasted like a tire. I couldn't eat it.

The uber was really close and yet it took like 5 minutes to arrive. It was a young man. They make me more uncomfortable. He welcomed me and made some small talk.

"Are you sick?"

I remembered the waiter and his suspicious face and his question. Was this going to be like that? Does he think I have a sore throat? Does he suspect anything? Why does my voice sound so manly? "No, why?" I answered.

"You're going to a medical center. People go to the doctor when they're sick."

I told him that I work there and that made us talk about psychology. His mom has Borderline pd and his father is bipolar. He has ADD. "Do you have something?"

"No" I lied.

Nymeria bites me. She does it over and over, almost every time that I hold her in my arms. Is it intentional? Does she try to hurt me? I don't think so. Just now she is almost inside her food plate biting it. Her teeth hurt, they're growing. She's teething. That's how is called in children.

Yesterday Anahi, after I sent her a picture of Nymeria on my legs, told me her cat died. Telma was her name. I asked her if it was true. I could not believe it. I didn't want to. Today Catherine told me how it was this monday that she had a rest day. The cat was irritable, and later she was having difficulty breathing. When they got to the vet, they told her that it was poisoning. She died on the table.

Anahi had the cat for several years. I remember her mentioning, Telma and Yoko. Until now that I have Nymeria, I guess I would had never understood the lose of a pet. Nymeria is more than just a pet, more than a dog. I care for her way more than I ever did for Stitch, or even Max and Sparky. I read of Anahi's cat and I imagined Nymeria's death. I couldn't help to cry.

She's outside walking into the darkness of the empty rooms. Does she want to be alone? Does she want to rest on her flower bed?

I've returned from there. She went to poop on her mat. Catherine told oh how her mother was surprised when she saw Nymeria going and actually peeing on the mat. I took a piece of toilet paper and grabbed the warm shit and threw it on the toilet. Stepping out of the bathroom I stepped on her front leg. A sharp high cry deafened me. I see her limbing on one leg and I feel guilty of the harm I did to her.

She's under my chair right now nimbling on my sandal.

Catherine would pick me up by noon. I got up and fed the dog. Outside my grandma had prepared me three burritos. Did I do something in the morning or did I just return to bed to continue sleeping? I remember setting the alarm to 10 in the morning. Two hours was enough to showering and getting ready. I turned off the lights and close my eyes.

I was falling asleep when I felt something wet in my behind. It was a pressure and warmth. Was it Nymeria's tongue? Why would she lick my asshole? I should had taken her off. But it felt so good. But it was so wrong. I should not let her. She's my puppy. Maybe if I didn't know that I could just stay this way. I am so comfortable, so relaxed. Each breath is deeper than the last. I feel some hands over my body. The darkness is not the one I am accustomed to. There is something strange in it, something that doesn't fit. Nymeria is small, she can't really climb to the bed. How does she reach me? I felt it more and more, the pleasure was drowning me. I let myself go and climaxed. I was dreaming. I should had woken up, I could still avoid the mess. No, it feels good. It should not matter. I stayed in bed and continued sleeping. I could deal with it when I wake up.

And some time later I did. I slipped my hand into my pants and there was nothing wet. I guess the hormones do make something. It's been months since I started. How much since the last time I ejaculated? It was in Mexicali, when we went to the course of neuro. No, once Catherine came to my house and I invited her to my bed; Nymeria was already here.

That time I came but didn't have a condom. In the rush I couldn't stop it. Both of us were surprised when almost nothing came out.

I showered and got ready. I put on the red blouse not caring about the heat. It's the last month of the year and it was 32Âº outside in the middle of the day.

We picked her mom from the border and left her home. Catherine drove us to the swap meet where we bought the sweaters for the gift exchange. It's done, it's over.

We went to the italian place near our high school, and from there we ate some ice cream.

Her session was at 6pm. We got there an hour before and stayed in the car for a while. Half an hour before we went into the office and her patient was leaving.

Liliana stepped outside after they entered. With her Karla stepped outside as well. Liliana kissed and hugged me. Karla looked at me and when I smiled, she recognized me.

I saw her as Ivan. I evaluated her as a boy. She was the last patient I saw in disguise. The only one who still doesn't know is Hiram.

I guess Liliana is right. It changes nothing. Everything is alright. I am a great person and that's the only thing that matters.

I hope.

The evaluation is done. I won't see the next patient until next friday. I have this whole week to myself and time to study. Tomorrow I'll use to rest. I don't have no plans of going out or having any sort of meeting. It will be just me time.

Yesterday, when I accompanied Catherine to her session with her patient, before entering to the office I got a message of my Patient, Arantza. I saw the notification with her name and opened it. She has my number and contact information. The message said she just wanted to thank me for this month of evaluation. I said it was a pleasure working with her.

Today I woke up in the morning to feed the dog. I think I gave her the food a half an hour later than usual. Nobody was awake. Was today the day I had the dream or was it yesterday? I remember narrating it in english, to Catherine I have no reason to do that. Maybe I dreamed the night before. I have the urge to open my phone and look for the message. I guess I'll do that.

It was today, this morning when I woke up from the dream and this morning when I had the chat with Catherine. I read her dream of going into a narc's house and having Nymeria with her and seeing whole families inside. Small children.

I got out of bed with the mixed emotions of the dream, but when I read hers, mine looked tame in comparison.

In mine it was some sort of Christmas or New year's party. I remember being in Mexicali, not because of something particular of the place, but being surrounded by family and relatives. Catherine was there, and maybe some of my friends as well. Some things happen about them, about Edgar and some uncles, but I didn't remember them. In the middle of the event, I don't remember if it was a courier that brought the package himself or some relative acted as a middle man. I was given a box, was it a box or a tube? Whatever it was, inside had a big piece of paper with its corners burned. It was like those letters that girls used to do in elementary school, that with a lighter they'd burn the edges of the sheet to give it some kind of decoration. This was big and it wasn't just the edges. Pieces of the inside were gone, words and phrases missing from the text.

I read the first line and it's redaction and language made me feel ill. "Hey! Hello, it's been a long time, you might not want to know about me but I wanted to wish you happy holidays..."

Who would send me something written in english? Monica was the one who appeared on my mind. I stopped reading and focus on the whirlwind of emotions that made a chaos of my insides.

I was excited knowing about her, but at the same time I was mad at her, sad and upset, angry even... but I was happy that she reached out at the same time. But with what nerve does she contact me?

I didn't know wether I wanted to read it or threw it away.

I continued passing the words and I got into the signature. It wasn't hers. Ruben Sanchez. Is that his last name? I didn't get to it until later in the day. His is not Gonzalez. I don't think is Sanchez either. Who knows...

Without the missing phrases I could read how he was in middle school and even though Monica told him I was "an effeminate man" he didn't care because I was his friend and always nice to him.

Some people helped me to read it and I got lost into it leaving the party as something outside.

I woke up with a mixture of different complex emotions. I don't think he cares about me or is even interested in what has happened to me. Maybe he doesn't even remember my name. Does he like Monica's new boyfriend? Do I hope he does?

I slept most of the day. My mom and grandma left to the salon and my dad left to work. This evening was the night of drinks with the psychologists of the office. Catherine would not go and I didn't know if I wanted to.

In the end I showered and convinced her to go. It was nice, I liked it and felt comfortable.

I guess I am not as lonely as I think.

## 2016-11-13

Yesterday I read about an indie game which was having a discount. Its price was lowered to zero because of Trump's winning of the presidency in the United States. The theme of the game was about lesbians, I think. I downloaded, maybe today or later I could play it. Since yesterday I've had the plans of not doing nothing today. Leaving this Sunday as a last day of leisure. Not like the rest of days in which I do nothing ignoring the things I must do. This day was free of any things to be done.

The papers for the application are still non redacted and unscanned.

Yesterday I painted my nails before leaving to the Coffee. I painted with red over the already almost-covered nails. My left thumb is already losing its finish in less than 24 hours. I have to buy another batch of pills and hormones. I have until this Friday with a full dose. The week before that I'll turn seven months and start another four day rest of estrogen.

Why do I keep entering and reading the posts about trans people? What do I gain reading about the opinions of the people who dismiss my identity and state of mind? I am nothing but a mentally ill freak. I am less than a person. A potential mutilated man in dress. Do I look like that?

The first was yesterday, the video about the 14 year old girl who was just starting hormones and making a statement about bullying. Most of the comments were graceful and supportive. That was actually different now that I think about it. I've seen that video several times. Years before it was really small the number of positive comments, now they were the majority. This time it was several threads in reddit. I shouldn't even care about the opinion of heterosexual men about wether they would or not be attracted to me. I won't be attracted to them.

What reason do I have to dismiss the Trans exclusionary radical feminists then? The women who insist I am a fetishistic male intending to invade women spaces?

Which was the first women's bathroom that I entered? I wasn't alone, I entered it with Catherine. Was it in the US or was it here? I've entered several now, I don't think I could even estimate a number. And yet, I still get nervous. I am anxious about suspicious or judging stares, I am scared of comments or making a scene. I'd really prefer that the bathroom were empty. For me, for my own safety.

I don't even see myself entering the men bathroom anymore. I don't think I can remember the last time I used a male public one. Most, if not all, of the late times that I've gone out, I've done it presenting female. I'm comfortable, mostly, with the way I look, the way I'm seen.

People gender me correctly and I've stopped worrying about their reason behind their words. I don't mostly care anymore if they do it out of ignorance of my situation or politeness or knowing support.

I remember some of the first smiles that accompanied their addressing me. Were they because I looked female or because I actually didn't?

I could argue that the latter is more validating and supporting.

I've been having this new urge of looking at my recent pictures and the first ones of this year. I didn't look as passable as I thought. Will I feel the same way about these ones when I see the other changes in the future ones?

Catherine went to work. This Wednesday probably will be the meeting with the dr in the office. I'll see Rene and talk about something, I guess. These next few days of the week I should start doing the slides of the tests and fixing the last details of the MMPI spreadsheet.

I have the motive letter to redact and lots of papers to scan. I know where most of them are. I think.

Talking yesterday about the future made me more feel more uneasy about it. As with the semester abroad, the closer the date it gets, to more far away I see it. The more disbelieve I grow that I'll actually get there.

I have reasons not to get nervous about it. In the car I told Catherine about the way my dad reacted when I told him. She's right. He does not my reasons, not completely.

Procrastinating about my getting ready will just push me further away from there.

## 2016-11-14

Yesterday was a day of justified leisure. Today I did nothing without having permission to not do it. I slept, a lot. I woke up early in the morning, an hour before Nymeria's time. It was six o'clock. I went back to sleep and I opened my eyes again at 7:40. Nymeria had already shat in the mat so there was no point in taking her outside. My grandma called me son and he again but I ignored her. The pain was still there, though. I sat and ate the two tacos that were in the red towel over the kitchen counter. My mother came down from her room. There was another towel on the table so I assumed mine were the ones I took. My mother was fooled as well. There was nothing on the table and the tacos I was eating were hers. She left and I stayed in the living room for a little more than an hour. I saw the latest episode of Westworld. Last night, when my father was walking upstairs to his room, he asked both Miguel and me, although his eyes were locked with mine, if we had seen the last episode of it. Apparently it was a really good one.

There was a popular theory on the internet that Bernard was really a host without knowing. There was a death of a central character and other important revelations.

I returned to bed near nine in the morning and didn't get up until one in the afternoon. Catherine was going to enter at noon. I told her I would not sleep yet. Nymeria was calmly falling asleep on her flower and she said to go and try to rest. I did and lost most of my morning.

Tonight the moon is supposed to be the biggest in who-knows-how-many years. The biggest and brightest, a really spectacular show. I haven't gone outside and I don't really feel like it. Catherine is in her home already. When she got out she told me how the moon wasn't that spectacular. I believe her.

I used to relate the moon to my ex. Whenever one of us would go to Mexicali, we would use the moon as a point of reference. Both of us could see it and we'd be looking at the same place. It was some sort of connection to the us. Was I the one who introduced the moon to our lore or was it her?

It was me, I used to write about her as if she were my friend, as if I confided in her in my loneliness. When we were a couple, I guess I introduced my ex to her.

Is it then another thing that was ruined because of her?

I don't mention the moon with Catherine. Neither does she. We don't miss her. We don't need it.

I had to shower just now. I felt disgusted with my own presence. I can't honestly remember the last time that I did. Was it Saturday? I guess it was. It should be. Two days bathing in my own sweat. Lost of hygiene is another symptom of depression.

This Friday my pills will run out. This morning when I fed Nymeria I realized the bag of food would not last me more than tomorrow. The mats have ran out to one, too. I sent my dad a message asking him if he could buy them for the dog. He loves her, even if he tries to deny it.

Is he proud that I completely take care of her?

If I did I wouldn't had needed him to buy those things for us.

When he came I asked him about any news of my car. Saturday he told me that the shop had said that they finally got the piece and would try the car the whole day. Today, he told me they contradicted themselves telling him that they hadn't gotten the piece yet. Tomorrow he'll call again and ask if the car can move. If it does, we might go and pick it up to take it to another shop.

I don't have to go out until Wednesday. There will be a meeting with Lili and my session later that day. Thankfully Catherine rests both that day and Friday. We'll go out Wednesday in the afternoon. Both of us had said that we would go to a motel. She asked me to wear the red dress.

Friday I'll see Itaye. I have to send her the location. Am I more or less nervous about me knowing her?

## 2016-11-15

I put on Catherine's dress like when we were just going out. I turned immediately to the mirror to look at myself. I am no longer scared of my reflection.

I woke up in the morning and fed Nymeria like every day. Had she shat already? I fed her with almost everything that was left in the bag and put on my hoodie. I took her outside. No, she just peed leaving a spot almost as big as her on the mat. I let her inside and ate the burrito and tacos that my grandma had made for me. This time I heard how she clarified to my mom that hers were on the table and she had left mine where they usually are. It wasn't much after eating that I brought the dog again to the room and went back to bed. Catherine would be picking me up around noon so I should be getting ready in the morning. Last time that we went out, both of us agreed that we would be going to a motel. I'd be wearing a dress and the two of us, our black bras.

I fell asleep around nine. Maybe a little before that. I know I dreamed something. I remember wandering around a hotel and being inside some sort of bathroom, again. I messed with the water, uh, how are they called. Those metal levels that you move to make the water come out and adjust its temperature. Whatever.

Inside the bathroom there was somebody else with me. Were both of us naked? He was a man. What was I? Did I care about covering myself?

Maybe that was a dream from the night. In the morning I know I dreamed about Monica, again. Luis was chatting with her on his phone. Were they talking about a picture? She asked him if I was there with him. I looked at him and told him with my face to deny my presence. It turns out she was referring to the picture. Something like that, it was weird.

Why do I keep dreaming about having contact with her and the uncertainty of my feelings about it?

Even in those dreams I don't know how to feel or react. I don't know if I want to reply or hear or read what she has to say. And yet at the same time I am excited, but at the same time guilty. I am ashamed of my own joy. I want to let her go, I want to just leave her behind in my past and history where she belongs now. Why do I keep dreaming about her? Is it because somewhere in my unconscious I don't want to?

Even if that was, there is nothing I can do. There is nothing left to try or say. I said and did what was for me to do or say.

It's over.

The alarm was set for waking me up an hour and a half before noon but it was useless. I changed it and postponed it countless times. Even now I can't remember at what time I finally got out of bed.

Catherine had sent me a message telling me that her father had told her to leave the car at the shop. So, in her house, they would only be having one, which was going to be used by her mom. Catherine told her that she was going to be out today, but her mom was already in the shower when she told me that. At the time of all those messages I was still dreaming about something.

She did came around two in the afternoon. I put on the red dress and then changed it to the gray one with the black decor, the first dress that I bought almost a year ago. I put on the blue one and stayed in that. I tamed my hair and put on my face. I waited with the dog and my grandma until it was my time to leave.

The first place we went to was the restaurant that took over the Ricardo's that we and the gang went to years ago after a class in the Mental Hospital. Now it's a betuccini's (or something like that). We ordered two paninis and two glasses of Sangria. It was expensive but not by that much. The ambient was nice and romantic.

We went to the AT&T and Soriana. We ended up in the same first hotel that I went to. We hugged and kissed and slowly took our clothes off and recognized our bodies as if there were years since the last time that we shared a bed.

I love her, I really do.

With her and my future, why do I keep dreaming about a past that I don't want to revive?

## 2016-11-16

It's don. Months ago, or was it years?, I saw it. I sensed it and noticed it and feared it. It was just a worry that later became a real threat. I got into some messages that wasn't meant for my eyes. My fears were confirmed in a cryptic confession saying he was a trans girl. I haven't slept easily since then.

He talked to a counselor in his school and a meeting was appointed. Today it's not just a secret that nobody knows I know. I've been told as if I had no idea nor suspicion. Countless nights I spent worrying and afraid about the consequences of this news. How would people take it, how would everyone see me? Would they believe them? Maybe they were just confused or following my steps. What if he wants to do something to his body? They are still a kid, they have no choice or voice. Would I be betraying them if I didn't stood by their back?

It's nothing permanent. They are barely starting puberty. I see myself in them, in their worries and fears. Everybody called me brave but I waited years. I blinded myself and hid under a dead shell. They are saying it, barely in the puberty. I was their age when they were born.

I need friends. I need somebody to reach out and talk and cry. I miss her. It's times likes this when I remember how it wasn't just heartaches and pain with her. She was one of the first people I told and didn't take it well at all. Why would I wish to come to her again with these?

Catherine picked me up in the morning. Just yesterday that we went out to dinner and to a motel I told her how I'm happy now with the way I look. I like myself and my body and my face. And then this morning I changed coming out of the shower and put on a blouse and these leggings. Inversely as years ago that I wore all normal clothes but a female attire, today I stood in the mirror with a woman's outfit but the long flannel man shirt. And even then I confronted the person in the door and I didn't find myself in their face. It was a him with broad shoulders and his hair tied back. I moved slowly challenging him, hoping that he'd fail to copy my moves and I would realize something were wrong.

I took out the blue blouse and changed it for a black tank. Everything came back to normal, and yet, still in that state of doubt about myself I discarded the idea of not wearing make up.

Catherine picked me up and drove us to the office. The dr was already there and setting everything up when we entered the coffee shop outside. We passed in front of two religious women preaching. I held her hand and felt her stiffness. We avoided them and I think a little part of me died.

The dr had difficulty remembering my name. He could name everyone but me. He hesitated before calling me everytime. Did he notice about... me? Was it because he sensed it was not a "real name"? Maybe unconsciously he dismissed it and forgot it every time. Maybe I'm just thinking too much about it.

Rene cancelled the meeting of today and my patient the one of tomorrow. I had thought it was for Friday and when I sent her the location she told me how something came up and we would have to postpone.

Rene was sick and I could hear his illness in his voice. This week my mother gave me the thousand pesos for therapy. I had told her how she hadn't. She was convinced she did and I was convinced she didn't. I wore my gray pants and when I tried to put my phone in the back pocket I felt pieces of folded paper in the way. Maybe it was a bill, or two. I felt that rush of joy of finding unaccounted money. I reached them and pulled out four bills for the amount of a thousand.

Is it bad if I keep them?

I told Catherine and she told me to.

Luis told two of their friends first before anyone else. Then he went to the counselor and last to the principal. "You did it backwards", they told him, not being able to imagine the load of those words and every emotion and fear and weight that they carry.

I think about them and my heart fills with memories of pain and my chest clenches.

I don't want them to go through it.

I don't want to go through it again.

I can't.

## 2016-11-17

This Saturday will be Luis' school's festival. Is it winter already? School will be out in less than a month. I should be studying for the upcoming test and the procedure of admittance of the master. Will I be entering school, too, this next year?

In the morning I woke up and the house was empty. My grandma is no longer here in Tijuana. Yesterday evening, my uncle, the husband of Cande called to the house and asked my father if he could pick up my aunt from the airport. They went, that was when my parents talked about the conversation with Luis' principal. It was when my uncle came for my aunt that my mom and I went to say good bye to them and my grandma who used their ride. We stayed outside the house and my mother told me.

So this morning was empty. I took some pills yesterday and then other ones this afternoon. They've helped but not enough. After feeding and taking the dog outside I returned to bed and went back to sleep. There was a new notification from Facebook in my phone. Today's Medrano's birthday. Would I congratulate him? He added me and commented on my picture. He was my friend, kind of. After all he was nice and caring.

My dad came and woke me. I was up when he approached my room. I drove the car following him to the new shop. We left the jetta there and he brought me back home. Had I eaten breakfast already? I served myself a bowl of cereal. After answering I realized he was offering to buy me something. I got here and maybe I tried to sleep again. No, I sent Manuel a congratulations message. He answered it in a comment below.

"Thanks, Sofia"

Were he not supportive, he would had not added me in the first place. Moments later he sent a message asking how I've been. He apologized beforehand would he slip a Ivan somewhen.

We chatted for a while. Had I graduated already? Am I practicing? How was it, that I realized and came to know I was, well, me...

I answered him and read what he had to tell me. He had a kind of psychotic break watching hypnosis videos on youtube. It was once to experience being a woman that made him fall into a derealization episode. He went to a psychologist and realized several things.

The conversation stopped and neither of us followed it.

I feel sick, I have a runny nose and a sore throat. Just yesterday Rene cancelled our session because of how he was feeling and that same day I break ill as well. I made myself a can of soup in the afternoon and then a cup of hot cider in the evening and now I'm drinking a cup of tea as I'm writing these words.

This will be the tenth day after my mistake of omission.

Catherine will be off her ship in an hour, maybe. Yesterday I finished at last the grades of math. From first to eight grade they are all done. Now it's just following the basis of geometry and trigonometry, which is what I don't really know very well and then to start reviewing Statistics and Calculus.

I should be starting reviewing the rest of the material. Biology and Physics and Chemistry. When I was a child excited with the idea of being a scientist I'd be thrilled to be studying these classes and themes. Would I love knowing how my life would turn out?

I remember being infatuated with Xennia in elementary school. She was the first girl that I cared about and missed. I would relate and play with Jessica and talk to her about the future. I draw myself taller and with glasses. I didn't know what I'd be studying. In elementary school I imagined myself as a scientist and an engineer. I wanted to study abroad far away from home, being independent and exploring the world. I wanted to have a girlfriend and feeling grown and attractive. It was a mystery all of it. What would I do, how would I look?

And here I am, with those same doubts about the future. Would I love going and facing myself, seeing their reaction as I stand in front of them. Would I be recognized? Would I be excited or scared? I did had a girlfriend, I met Monica and loved her. I met friends and fell in love with another girl. I studied psychology and travelled the world as I wanted to. I lost myself and found the real me. I am finally happy.

I am happy.

I got to know what happiness really feels like.

Would I be able to convince myself?

Am I able to convince myself?

## 2016-11-18

Yesterday we took the car to the shop. I drove the jetta and my dad accompanied me in his job's pick up to bring me back home after. I wrote how he woke me and I waited him to enter the door. This morning he sent me a text message saying the car was done and he would pick me up around nine in the afternoon to pick it up. I woke up sickish with my head hurting and my nose running. I took Nym outside and return to sleep again. I know I dreamed several things. I remember nothing.

I put the alarm at 8 and half to get up and be ready for my dad. I didn't really have the intention of showering or even changing clothes. Today would be a day of sleeping and resting. I had no plans. My father had asked me if I was to going out and I answered him no. Plans changed, I guess...

He opened the door of my room and I barely woke up. Nymeria is lying beside me biting and clenching with her jaw the little walls on the inside of her plate. There is no food inside. Maybe it's just the anxiety of teething.

I grabbed my phone, my wallet and the house keys. He asked me if I was ready and if I were going to go like that. "Yeah"...

Was he saying it because I was not decent? Maybe he was just surprised of seeing me in male clothes and with my hair tied. I got into his pick up and he drove. We got to the shop and he stepped off and went inside. Someone gave him the keys and he walked out. I stayed in the cabin of his truck. I didn't want to get off. Maybe he would just drive the car towards the truck and just exchanges cars.

He signaled me something but got into the car anyway. He drove it inside into the shop. After a little conversation with some of the mechanics, he signaled me again to go to them. I walked inside and the mechanic said good-morning. People saw me. I was just someone in pajamas and recently out of bed. Maybe that was. Were my fingernails still painted? Did I uncolored them yesterday or this morning?

I drove back home and he went to his job. This time he didn't offer me to buy food. What did I ate for breakfast? Oh, right. I took the bread from the table and then in the afternoon, nothing.

Catherine sent me a message saying she was in her elementary school and just saw somebody she knew. She would not go with Vania and her patient had cancelled. "Do you want to do something?"

We agreed to going to the movies and maybe eat something. The car was ready so I picked her up. She offered to drive. No, I drove first. I remember her driving and turning around the hospital to avoid the traffic. Yeah, we got first into the Theaters in Paseo Chapultepec. We bought the tickets and decided to eat in the food trucks near Liliana's, no, our office.

It was there that she offered to drive. We went to the Foodies La Cacho. We were going to try the craft pizza but instead we bought burgers. She ordered and asked my burgers without cheese. I was there when she said it and saw how the cashier annotated it in the order. After some minutes the burgers came and both had it. I decided against saying something. I told her it was because of the time, but honestly, I fear confrontations when I feel vulnerable.

The dispatcher woman in the gas station welcomed me using female pronouns. I've changed, I put on the old make up I used to wear months ago. I saw my face weirdly in the mirror when I got out, but in the pictures I took in the food place I seemed alright. Even after the movies, I went into the women's bathroom and nothing happened, nobody saw me suspiciously or said anything. It's like if I were invisible... no, not really. It's as if I belonged.

We went to see the movie of Fantastic beasts. The continuation of the Harry Potter universe. In the previews they showed a film, a documentary about the beatles. I told Catherine we could go see that and she was a little surprised. She looked at me as if she were meaning to ask something and instead she said she saw the preview and remembered about her distance with her best friend Viridiana. Was it today when she showed me the post about their friendship?

We all have a past, I guess.

## 2016-11-19

I thought Catherine would not go to then think she would, again doubting she'd make it and finally receiving her, again, inside my old elementary school.

I woke up around six in the morning. The sun wasn't out yet. I barely opened my eyes consciously about my surroundings when I perceived the silhouette of Nymeria trying to climb my bed. In what seemed like a blink I saw her going to the mat with her tail high and her back legs arched. It was too early to feed her. I cleaned her evacuations and told her to go back to bed. We slept again for some time. I fed her later in the morning, around eight, closer to nine. I had to awaken her. My father came with breakfast. We all sat at the table to eat. It's been long since that happened.

I slept again. I've been feeling really tired. Maybe it's the flu or the allergies. I don't know. Luis' thing was in the afternoon. I returned to bed and put the alarm by eleven. It was time enough to get ready by noon. He had to be in his school by one. I could not get up from the bed. It was noon already and I just took my clothes to the bathroom. My mother was just finishing with her hair and everyone but Miguel were changed and ready. I asked her if they were all going to leave Luis. "Is Miguel ready?" I told her I didn't know. He was in the living room in his pajamas. He came upstairs and asked if he had to go. He didn't want to. I showered and said that I would caught up to them. Catherine told me how they would not let her leave early. Even the workers from the am shift were still there.

I painted my nails and my mom called. "I'll pass the phone to her", I heard him say and grabbed the phone. She told me that there were posts already set up so we should get going. She thought that Catherine would go still.

I left right then. Nymeria stayed with Miguel in the living room. I drove towards the school I went to, how many years ago? One since graduation, four of college, three of highschool and three of middle school. 11 years ago since I graduated from that school. 11 years ago when I was younger than Luis and he was still a baby. When I was a normal child and would never imagined myself as I look right now.

I sent some messages to Catherine. She took her rests and then told me how she had gotten off. The friends of her mother would take her to Cathy's job and from there she could come. She had missed Luis dance already, but maybe we could go somewhere to dinner. My phone was dying. It had less than three percent when we exchanged the last messages moments before I welcomed her outside the school.

I told her how I've dreamed a lot in that building. Countless dreams have happened in the second floor of there. Me in classes or coming out, climbing the stairs. Going still to school even in college as if something were still unfinished or undone.

I made the mistake of asking my mother if she talked to her psychologist friend about the reference. She told me how her friend told her that she didn't think it was a good idea sending him to anyone. He was in his teenage years, in the phase of puberty and the hormones and the physical changes and the chaotic emotions. It might just be a phase of a pattern as consequence of affiliation or something like that. I could feel and see my body as she was talking. I noticed my hands calming themselves and my feet not finding where to stay.

I feared that. I feared nobody would believe him that everyone would just assume that he'd be following my steps, that I was the first and real one and he was just confused or imitating. Am I making this, my hell, harder for him?

Selfishly I don't want to go through what I went through again. I don't want to re-experience, even vicariously, what I suffered. I don't even want to witness it. And yet, I am abandoning him. I am letting him go through everything alone and without support, without help, doubted and denied. All of it because of me.

How can it not be my fault?

## 2016-11-20

Days keep passing by like shooting cars on a highway or raindrops falling on the window in a rainy night. After not being able to sleep I took my phone and opened the photos app. I went back to the beginnings of the year and looked at the pictures of me. Month by month I reviewed my face and expressions. Seeing when and what clothes I bought. The first times I wore them and the smiles in the pictures I took. I could see the subtle changes on both my appearance and apparent mood. I see the most recent ones and compared to the first ones, I am different. I have changed.

Today it's been seven months since the first day I took my hormones. Seven months, more than half a year.

Tomorrow I'll see Itaye. I remember talking to her in high school. Once after a class or in a free hour we sat and chatted. She asked me what I was going to study or what my plans were for the future or something like that. She was Telma's friend. Telma was this soccer player, dark-skinned girl with black hair and playful toughness in her personality. I don't think she knows about me. I haven't heard from her in years. We were never close, really. With lots of people I wasn't.

I woke up early today but kept returning to bed. I am and was tired. When I took Nymeria outside I felt a roughness in my throat. Maybe rest and sleep would help. I ate both of my biscuits. Fuck it. We would do nothing today. I asked them and they answered. Maybe tomorrow we'll go to the United States. Tomorrow is a free day because of the revolution of Mexico. I did not know that. I'll see a patient in the evening. I should print the interview right now. I don't need to rehearse it. I could do it freehand now, I guess. It's comforting having a guide, though.

Catherine went to work and back. Now she's asleep, I guess. She's just answering. Moments ago I got into the pottermore page where I did the tests that supposedly tell you which Hogwarts house would you end up selected in. I did the other one as well that tells you what form your patronus would take. That being the spell of defense that is made from the happiest memory you have.

Would I even be able to cast it?

What would my happiest memory be? I don't think I have the energy or will to ponder about that right now.

Yesterday I went to dinner with my family and Catherine. We went to that restaurant in the neighborhood of my childhood. I lived far away from there, nonetheless I went to grade school and jr high there and my mom's school is there and the house of my childhood best friend. The first time we went to that place was with Norma and Jessica. In 2008 when the crime spree in Tijuana developed that place was the host of one of the firsts civilian shootings. Panic reined over the city for years. People narrate that period as when the narcos stopped just killing themselves and everyone were in danger.

Ever since I was a young child I feared criminals. I told Rene several times in session how to me, monsters were real, but there were no ghosts of beasts, they were killers and kidnappers. They would come to my home and take me from there or kill all of us to take our stuff. But even then, I never really considered myself in danger. I mean, yeah, nothing protected me, but I wasn't more vulnerable than anyone.

Now, I am. I live in the second most dangerous country for trans people. The north one have some draconian laws that try to control even where I can and can't go to the bathroom. I have to hide and protect the my identity and personhood for fear of being doubted, or harassed or even attacked.

People might come and flirt with me and then turn hostile when they realize why I am not interested. Even walking around holding the hand of the woman I know is something that infuriates lots of people. Our relationship is not natural in their eyes. We are a menace to their values and families. My own existence is a burden and disgrace to them. They don't know me, they haven't seen me nor heard my name. And yet, I am hated.

## 2016-11-21

I saw my patient, Itayee. She's the first patient that I get by myself. I charged her my fee and attended her by my own. I feel fine. I guess...

Catherine went to work today. She has the same schedule as last week. That means she'll rest tomorrow and Wednesday and Friday. She'll get off her shift later today in the night. She got in at 2 in the afternoon, so she'll get home probably an hour before midnight.

I didn't know until yesterday that today is a free day. I sent Lili a message asking her if the Center would be open and if she'd be there. Her answer was just a thumbs up and a kissing smiley. I got up thinking we would go to the United States. Luis and my grandma were already up and in the living room. I took Nymeria outside but let her back in after realizing the floor was all wet. I ate two tacos of the eggs my grandma made as breakfast. My father came down and when I asked him, he replied that my mother didn't want to go, if I had a reason to go to the Unite States. I told him no. I mean, I want to go, but I don't think I have a reason. I can wait another week, I guess.

I went back to bed around nine in the morning and stayed in bed for most of the day. I slept and slept and dreamed and dreamed. My mind rested and didn't. Nymeria stayed with me in the room lying on her flower. Someone woke me because of some reason but I can't remember.

I didn't get up until two when I fed Nymeria and started considering getting ready. My mom went somewhere, was it Rosarito? I don't know.

Catherine got off and just sent me a message she's waiting for the bus. We are talking about my patient and how my session went.

I got dressed with jeans and a grey hoodie and gave my face a pass with the double edged razor. There was no point in shaving my chest or my pits. My clothes were androgynous. Yeah, all of them were women's but still, there was something in my image that even made myself doubt.

Time passed and I didn't know if waiting or leaving. Catherine talked about a protests of the bus and taxi drivers. She left home early because of that. I returned for a 100 bill and my ring. I've been wearing the graduation ring almost daily. I didn't even want it when we were looking for grad packages. I like that it's feminine and its design that it's two rings interlaced, as the two people I were at the moment of graduation.

I'm seeing a video posted by Vinicio, well, more like shared, about the sex reassignment surgery of a MtF trans person. He had several likes on his post but I got into the original video to read the comments. Why would I enter into that? There are hateful comments and the defensive ones that question why the people are so hateful or judgmental about the actions and bodies of others. I remember years ago when I would read those same comments and variety, but the ratio was very different. Now it's more like half and half. And even then, I read most of the negative ones and they readily mention God.

Do I have a reason now to hate religion and distance myself from those places?

Catherine is home. I sent her a message telling, asking her if she wanted to do something tomorrow or the day after that she'll be free. She answered that she doesn't know. She wants to, but she doesn't feel like going out.

Why do I feel hurt by that?

I drove towards the Medical Centre and all the way there I realized how early is the sunset now. It wasn't even five thirty and it was already dark. I got and parked next to a car without wheels. We were the only two cars parked outside. The Food places across the street were almost all empty. Just a sushi place and the one on the corner were the only opened.

I had thought about going into the D'volada and buy a cup of chai tea. When I got to the door I realized it was closed and a pinprick of fear caught my attention. I sent a message both to Lili and my patient. In some moments Lili came down and then my patient arrived. Everything went well. I just, it's done, I guess. I'll have tomorrow free.

Maybe Wednesday I'll just see Rene. Maybe I will see Catherine. Who knows...

## 2016-11-22

"Has Luis eaten?" "No, he's upstairs. We talked on our way here, and when we arrived he got into bed" I sensed what that was about and stayed quiet while sitting in front of my computer at the same table. My dad went somewhere, maybe the kitchen, maybe upstairs. He left. My mother turned to me and felt the need to update me. "I asked him about his discomfort, since when it began. He said it's been around four months, since the changes started, the hair and... the puberty changes... What do you think? Should I take him to a sexologist?"

I was empty inside, both in my chest and my mind. There was no thought or emotion but the urge of getting away. I shook my head and told her I didn't know. "How don't you know?" I don't. I asked her if she won't go to therapy herself. She said she hasn't been able to contact the psychologist. And conversation died there.

I sent a message to Catherine but it stayed unseen and later unanswered. When she finally replied it was with a twist of the mouth and confessing she doesn't know what to tell me.

I don't want her to say anything. There is nothing to say. Then what do I want? What is the purpose of my sharing?

I feel this nervousness and uneasiness all over me. I'm exhausted and I don't know why. In the back of my mind lies this fear that I am sick. That there is some disease taking toll off my body, Maybe the illness is a series of irrational thoughts or heavy emotions. Maybe.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. Last week he called me a couple hours before the session, when Catherine and I were on our way to the meeting in the office, to cancel it. I understood, even though I really needed it. I need it now, too. Maybe more, yeah, I think I need it more.

Why does every time that I consider of leaving therapy or prolonging my sessions something comes that makes everything so hard?

I've been remembering those times that I can't send away the idea of breaking up with Catherine.

It's not that I don't love her anymore or that I am sick or tired of her company. It's not that I don't want to see her again.

What is it? Why do I consider isolating myself when I am burdened by the fear of ending alone?

Yesterday a sentenced came when I was asleep. Maybe it was a dream or just a pre-oniric thought. "I think it's best to get used to not being around you while I have friends and family, that bear the loneliness of being completely alone"

Is that a reason or an excuse?

I won't break up with her. I don't want to. It's the opposite of what I desire.

I woke up in the morning just moments after my mother left the house. I ate and took my pills in the meantime of Nymeria's breakfast and going outside. I returned to bed as usual and slept through most of the morning. It happened some other days before. In the in-betweens of those moments of consciousness I am troubled by the realization that most of the day has passed, that I am wasting daylight to be hidden in slumber avoiding reality. I think about seeing the watch and noticing how is the late afternoon and feeling guilty about being so useless and weak. I end up seeing hte hour and noticing it's not as late as I feared. And even then, I am unable to get away, to get up and face the world. I cowardly return to dark avoidance of rest.

Nymeria climbed the bed and I let her lie by my side. She stayed there for an hour before wandering around and me putting her down.

Lili asked who evaluated Arantza so that person could get in contact with the psychiatrist to arrange the delivering of the report. I answered and she gave me the number. It was late already so I didn't decide to call his secretary right then. My father was by my side and my mother on the head of the table. Honestly I guess I was ashamed of calling and introducing myself as the psychologist Sofia. The act itself and being witnessed by my parents.

With what face can I confront my father anymore when he might think that he losing another child is my fault.

I don't know that. I am putting thoughts and emotions in him.

I am the thinks that. I am the one who blames myself.

I thought about going to the beach after session. Having some time to myself in some coffee place to think or not-feel.

## 2016-11-23

I agreed with Catherine to go out today. She had said that she didn't really feel like going somewhere. She did want to see me, but the idea of going out, I guess it was tiring to her. I told her my plans of visiting the beach, even if I had to go alone. I had to leave my home, I could not stay here. Before falling asleep she told me she could accompany me. Later we confirmed. Today we could set the plan.

I got up before my mother left. I went to the kitchen while Nymeria ate. There was a tortilla bag with two tacos inside. Or where there three? I don't remember. I ate half of the first one and Nymeria came to the second part of her morning routine. When we returned back inside I took my pill case and finished my meal.

I was tired, even though I had convinced myself that I would stay up all morning and won't sleep until the night, I couldn't resist getting into the sheets. I slept maybe two or three hours more. I know I dreamed with Monica again. I made a mention of it with Rene. Even later I would made a comment about that with Catherine. We have talked about what would happen were our relationship end. Could we stay friends or keep contact? The answer she had given me was a no. Even when I insisted and urged her to think or consider, she said it would depend on the circumstances. I remembered her. She changed her mind. I told her how, no matter what happens between us, I would never want to go through what I went with Monica again.

In my dream I was in my old house in Otay, specifically my parent's bedroom. I was alone, I think. And the phone, or was it my cellphone?, rang and I answered. Her voice came through the speaker. I did not see her face, I could not sense her intentions from her inflection nor words. Why would she talk to me? Why, after all this time, would we speak to each other?

I can't remember the beginnings of the conversation, but when she used a feminine word to describe me, I felt both excitement and disbelieve. Why would she say that? What happened?

I woke up and gave it no more thought than it deserved. I showered and changed. We agreed, Catherine and I, that she would meet me outside Rene's and from there we could go to the beach. I talked in the morning to the psychiatrist office and received the e-mail from his secretary. I forgot to send it before leaving to my session.

I walked to Rene's office and waited a couple of minutes outside. I bought a bottle of lemonade to break a 100 bill. The cashier asked me if I had the 10 pesos, but I didn't tell him that my whole intention of the transaction was that I didn't. He looked at me with a faint face of irritation.

In the session I spoke about my home. I thought about talking about Monica's dreams before Luis, to waste time, to avoid it just as I avoid it in real life. But I didn't. I talked about it since the very beginning. I cried an important fraction of the session. I spoke about how it happened, how it hurt, how my mother told me and my father and talked to him.

At the last 10 or 15 minutes I made a mention of my ex's dreams, their frequency and importance, my reaction and emotions related to them and my thoughts. Later, when I talked about the idea of breaking up with Catherine because of my fear of not being able to get over her alone, I related my wish to get away, to flee and leave Luis and my family to deal with this whole situation.

"So, just like Monica did".

It was such a great punch, than instead of being hurt I broke into laughter.

"I don't know how to feel about that. Should I came to understand more about how she felt and her motive, or do I have more reason now to resent myself just as I do her".

Catherine waited for me outside. We stopped at Soriana and bought a loaf of bread each. She bought a plate for her dog and a doughnut.

We went to Argana. The service is worse every time we go. And as such, every time that we are served by the waitress of the time before our leaving, I cringe before her speaking. She misgendered me again. This time, more than sadness, it was irritation.

We made a stop in the coffee near the beach and we talked and chatted as we did when we were in college. We saw the dark waves coming and whistling and shared stories and memories.

I agreed of having a drink with Paola tomorrow. A coffee, more than a drink. I'll explain and give her tutorship about the MMPI. I'm a little excited about it. Maybe we could talk and plan the course before my next departure.

## 2016-11-24

Even after the insight and both self and given interpretation I could not get out of bed. I woke up, again, before my mother had left. I ate while Nymeria did as well. I took her outside and return to my pills and the rest of my meal. I had agreed to meet Paola in the Starbucks of the Galerias plaza an hour after noon.

In the night I got woken up by the cold. Is it dusk or dawn? Which is the early morning. Opening a new tab to look up for a word makes me lose time and the flow of thought. I'll just look it up later. It's not like I don't have distractions anyway. Just now I'm returning from cleaning the piss on the outside of the mat.

I took the thick sheet? Covertor? Cobertor? I don't know, that thing I place over the sheets so I am more warmed. I dreamed about something. The second time I woke up I was wet from nightmarish sweat. I don't think my ex was in this batch of dreams.

She wasn't in the second either. Again I let Nymeria got on my bed and sleep with her. Almost all of morning passed. I started to get ready just minutes before noon. It was weird going to that plaza. It's been a lot since I stepped foot in there. I can't even estimate the months that have been since I went there. I went with my parents. One movie, I got into the movie theater and felt exposed.

This time I got just some minutes short of the accorded time. I waited resting on the fence of the central garden in front of the Starbucks. I thought about ordering something but I had in mind how Paola said it would be her treat. It would be awkward ordering after that, and I wasn't in the mood to let something free go away.

I knew, well, inferred, that Monica would be working. It's a week day and it was just noon. Even then I felt just as exposed as that other time I didn't even recalled. Every person going and turning could be noticing me or seeing me. My clothes were androgynous as if I were expecting that. I wore the same black leggings and one of the long-sleeved shirts from my male wardrobe. I didn't put on my flats but the red vans tennis shoes. I even considered going with my face without any make up. I put it on like the first times I used it. Something subtle. I took a picture and sent it to Catherine telling her how today I did went boyish. She said I looked even girlier than yesterday. Was that the answer I was waiting for?

Paola sent me a picture of the traffic she was in, I replied her saying not to worry and that I would wander around window-shopping. I entered the Walmart of the place and looked around. I carried the backpack with my laptop and stuff. It's the Comercial Mexicana where they ask or demand that you left any bags in some wardrobe to be kept while you shop. I forgot about that completely until I thought I heard the voice of a worker calling for me. I decided to leave and went outside again.

Paola didn't hesitate to arrive after that. We talked, at first I explained the test to her, how the simple statistics apply to psychometrics and what do they mean in the context of the MMPII and the T-scale.

After I finished she told me how she had actually understood it. She could do her homework without problem. We stayed there with our drinks just chatting about school and the future and everything. I think we left around four.

Catherine's shift is over. She should be on her way now.

With Paola, she told me about giving a course to her classmates, explaining the homework and the test. I agreed. I could do that and earn some extra money. I told her to post it. By the time we left, she had just one answer. I guess probably there won't be anything tomorrow.

She gave me a ride to my car. I paid the ticket in the last booth instead of the ones in the parking lot.

Nymeria is outside. I call out her name hoping for an answer or hearing her footsteps signaling her arrival but instead my mother tells me that she's there hoping for some food to fall out of the table.

When I went to the bathroom I think I heard her vomit. After coming downstairs she stepped on the doorframe of my room and told me how Nymeria had hopped and fallen on one of her legs. I looked at her expecting some follow-up with new information about Luis or her first session. But there was nothing. Even now, I think how I'll finish the words and she'll greet me with an uncomfortable conversation.

This is almost as hard as before that I had opened up about me.

## 2016-11-25

I remember as if it were yesterday how I missed a day and lost the hundreds streak. Now I've finished almost three weeks since then, almost a fifth of a hundred. Time's running, blindingly fast. It's nauseating. Yesterday I finished the words at an early hour and went to bed just entering the night. Even I was surprised that I could sleep that early. It wasn't even ten o'clock when I told Catherine I would try to sleep. I know I dreamed something but I can't remember its contents.

I sent a message to Paola asking her if there were any news about the potential course I could give in her university. She didn't answer until this morning. Her message says that only the one girl that had commented but even she said nothing afterwards. I thanked her and, a little relieved I continued with the new day.

Yesterday I agreed with Catherine to doing something in the afternoon. I proposed it and she said that she was thinking of going out with her parents. They could go somewhere for breakfast. Later today she explained that she misses those Sunday's family breakfasts. Now that she works, she doesn't eat with her family. The weekends that her father doesn't work, she does. So, she took the opportunity of her father's given day because of Thanksgiving and invited them to the restaurant we went with my family. If she went to breakfast with her family, she could pick me up and do something after her meeting with the patient.

By that time I would had already finished with the course on Paola's school or taking Nymeria to her last shot in the vet. I didn't do none of those things.

After breakfast, both Nymeria's and mine, I took us back to bed, literally. I invited her to climb up and we slept for the rest of the morning. Later that my mother and grandma came downstairs to breakfast she woke up and I opened the door to let her out and accompany them.

Even after sleeping early yesterday and resting most of the night, I was exhausted and unable to get up and out.

Catherine went and returned from her breakfast and then went on her way to the office. I showered and changed. I'm wearing the red pants and the squared blouse half buttoned. Every one of my clothes is feminine, I'm wearing make up.

I decided not to take Nymeria to the vet. I can take her in the weekend or next week. Later when I went to the bathroom and calmly checked the date I realized how today isn't even the day that she turns 4 months.

Catherine picked me up earlier, her patient was a no show.

I left just a little after my mom and grandma returned from picking Miguel from school. I got into her car and greeted her. We tried to decided where to go with no avail. She was hungry. I ate just one or two nuggets that my mother bought me. The rest with the fries are still in the kitchen. We stopped in the park and chatted for a while. I had a deja vu. I asked her about where to go and she told me she didn't want to talk about that right then. She continued talking about Liliana and the psychologists.

We ended up going to the Alitas. We had fun chatting and talking and laughing. We ordered each a drink with tequila and clamato. She ate a burger and I some wings. After finishing we went for a hot drink in Dinasty12. Everything turned upside down. We talked first about something... well, obviously. Before that, the waitress received us and put the menus on the table. She welcomed us with the neutral masculine. And then confirmed it again with a "listos". When I told Catherine she told me how she thought she had said "Bienvenidas", but later "listos". I'd lie if I say it wasn't upsetting. I even told Rene how I stopped caring that much, but it was disheartening.

We talked about DF. What could we take with us and all that. Somehow the question about she coming with me came up.

I remember. We talked about birthdays and I told her that by hers maybe I wouldn't be here anymore. That's when the question came up, maybe she could come with me?

"I don't want to..."

"I know you have to go and stay there earlier, but I don't want to. It's the opposite of the semester abroad. Then I could not wait to leave, but know I don't want to until I have to"

She noticed how my face changed. Later on our way home she asked me if she had made me upset. I lied to her.

I have to, but I don't want to, either. Even when I told Paola, I repeated how it everything fits. Even if I don't get in, doing it this way I can fix my papers and all of that. It's as if I want to convince everybody that it's the best way and most rational choice.

But I'm scared.

I am really scared. I want her to come with me, I don't want to do this alone. I don't know if I can.

But I can't ask her. Less now that I know she doesn't want to.

## 2016-11-26

Nymeria is lying on her new bed by my side. The little couch-like mattress is right besides the desk. I was thinking about putting it next to my bed, but hers is almost wider than half of the free space between the bookcase and the bed. She looks small lying on there. I like seeing her biting it and turning around and then resigning herself to lying and resting.

The images of the dream of last night are still lingering on the back of my mind. I sent Catherine a message in the morning. The text reads that I found it hard to fall asleep, I was scared about thinking of next year's moving and had the effects of the late tea. I had bad dreams.

I wasn't really expecting her to ask about more information of my dreams.

I went to bed earlier but could not rest. The thoughts of going to the capital and the conversation of earlier with Catherine bounced over and over in my conscience. What will my travel entail? I'll have to go to the airport and present both my boarding pass in the wrong name and a confirming id with a mismatch picture. I'd go through security and again present the boarding ticket at the gate.

I'll arrive to the new city and will have to find a way to move to the hotel or inn or hostel or whatever I'm going to check in. In there, somebody will ask me about a reservation that I'll have to make in the wrong name as well, because I have no way of confirming my identity.

Then I'll look for a new apartment in which I'll have to call and set up meetings with landlords or roommates that will be potentially discriminating and hateful. How many offerings will I have to ignore because they ask for a man which I am not, or a woman, which they won't believe I am?

Getting an apartment will be a struggle all on its own. Even after outing myself and still being accepted and having it and setting the papers and formalities, I'll still need to look for a way to verify my address. I need an address verifier to start the process of changing it, so all of this will still be presenting me as Ivan to strangers and explaining my situation. After having this way of confirm that I live there, I can finally start the process of getting a local id, which, again I'll have to get with the forgotten name, and registering to the free sex clinic. In the latter, I'll present tons of different documents with the wrong name and gender so I'll can be interviewed by a psychologist or even a social worker that will assess me if I can be a candidate of their services.

 A month later I'll have enough to finally start the process of changing of name. With a new id with a match picture but wrong information I'll be able to ask for a new birth certificate. 10 days after, I'll get the paper which will let me process, again, the local id with my new name and info. And a month after that, I'll finally have something that ensures my identity.

Until then, I'll be battling the world trying to defend who I am. I'll be vulnerable and exposed in a large and dangerous new city. A tiny animal in a jungle filled with wild predators.

I woke up some minutes before seven. At the night I invited Nymeria to climb the bed. We ate some food and while she pooped I took my pills. I was thinking about the dream in which I was with Monica in a room somewhere. We talked and, were we laughing? Why the happier I am in those dreams, the more upset I wake up?

I waited an hour in the living room to anyone to came down and confirm we would be going to the United States. Both of us slept for an hour or two.

We did go. We ate brunch at Denny's where I asked for the burger with egg inside. I was wearing lady jeans and the purple sweater. My father called me Ivan twice and I think I heard my mother say it once along the day.

In the Denny's my mother said how she skipped her course yesterday because she wasn't feeling alright, emotionally. She called in, the session had moved things too much. Later, she threw at the table how she was recommended by her therapist that we should all attend family therapy. My father looked at her, no, he stayed facing ahead, but his face changed confirming he heard her. He said nothing, though.

I don't want to. I don't want to explain myself again, or defend who I am, or hear what emotions I am causing them, their pain and grief because of something I did not ask nor choose. Catherine said maybe I wouldn't be the protagonist, but Luis. Still I am scared.

I don't want to stay and I don't want to go.

I want people to see me. I don't want to defend who I am, just be. Why can't I just be? Why does it have to be so hard and laborious and difficult for me to prove who I am, to live my life?



## 2016-11-27

I moved the bed back next to mine. Every time I turned off the lights, Nymeria would get off hers and calmly waltz over mine and climb to my side. After the third time I moved the bed to just push her out. She spent the night in there. It passed silently.

The morning was usual. I didn't took her out because of the rain. I let her do her stuff inside. It was a quicker routine. The breakfast came as usual. The dog looks cuter in her red holiday t-shirt. In the morning when we slept again I let her climb to the bed and even hold her between my arms. I felt the beating of her heart on my chest.

The nights feel a little less lonely.

I've been studying the math subjects in the page. Yesterday that... no, it wasn't yesterday. I returned with Catherine. Yesterday I went out with my parents to the United States. It was Friday that I and Catherine went to eat. On our way home we talked about French and how every time I would say some word in that language she would think of my ex.

I remembered Liliana's recommendation of the Duolingo site. I've been thinking today about returning to it. I might sign in with the different e-mail, a new profile. Start over again.

The subjects in the test guide are still unreviewed. The dates of the timeline are closer than I imagined. The first deadline is this Friday. I have done that thing, I guess. I am registered on their database. My legal info is. I have an extra month to upload the papers. The period of time where I was supposed to send the e-mail asking for a bank reference started already. I sent it today.

I should have uploaded the papers I have and written the letters needed to be redacted.

For a while I forgot or ignored the possibility of going to the family therapy that my mother mentioned.

Somehow we talked about the past and everyone from my mother and grandma mentioned the memories they have of Ivan and everything. My father called me with that same name to hand me the week money. Maybe a session would be the perfect setting to mention my discomfort and my pain. Because I understand, it doesn't mean I don't suffer.

In the show I watch, Shameless, Trevor, the trans guy has an argument with Ian when the bar where they were supposed to go is closed of an event. Ian mentions another cowboy bar nearby, but Trevor shoots down the idea saying they card on the front door. "You are over 21", he says not understanding. I did understand him. I understood him too well.

Catherine is upset because Anahi proposed her to go to Universal Studios the same day we set the Christmas party with our friends. She tells me how when she told his dad about going, he reply to her how they can go to somewhere where they don't have to ride anything.

She is upset. She could not go to the premieres, and when the park opened, she was not able to attend with us as we had planned. I see her frustration.

I feel like an asshole thinking how I'd give anything so that my issues were just those, not being able to go soon to a theme park I've been meaning to go.

I resent her for her answer about not wanting to go with me. I ask her if she has told Anahi how she felts, and yet I lied to her when she asked me if she had saddened me.

Earlier, months ago, when we talked about marriage and why she wasn't comfortable with the idea of doing it, she mentioned we were not ready. She didn't feel ready, and she didn't think I was either.

"You're too self-absorbed in your own issues to care about mine". Moments like these make me think she's right.

I'll see my patient tomorrow, tomorrow evening, thirty minutes after last week. Earlier that same day I plan to take Nymeria to the vet. I was just thinking about something else I could or wanted to do. Was it going to Dax and buying another nail polish? Was it looking for tights? Why would I need any of those things?

This Wednesday I'll see Catherine when we'll go to Lili's meeting. It's next week that we'll go to Bettuccinni's for Gilda's birthday and two days later the Christmas party. I was thinking of wearing the dress this Wednesday, maybe I could wear it at the party, or maybe I could wear the other gray one, Catherine used to say how it looks very holiday-ish.



## 2016-11-28

I woke up half an hour before it was time to get up. I can't remember if I tried covering myself again with the green blanket. If I did, I should had woken up in the middle of the night drowning in sweat and took it off. I slept the time until 7. In my dreams I was in some kind of school, was it the same building that I told Catherine I keep visiting in the nights when I sleep? I looked for a place to sit and realized I was wearing a school skirt. It was weird and unfamiliar having to worry about keeping my legs closed in a class setting. Something happened in it, maybe the classmates, maybe the teacher, I just remember the dread of worrying if they could notice I was different.

Was I a child? Was I older?

I fed the dog and let her shit outside in the wet floor. We came back and I filled my pill box and made two tacos with the eggs that were in the pan over the stove. I was in my bed again, under my sheets when I was talking with Catherine and seeing Facebook. I scrolled down and stopped at the window of the "people you might know". The first one caught my attention, none of them had any friends in common with me. Raul, he was from COLEF, another intern of our time there. I looked to the other one. The picture was darkened, Leslie Fernandez.

Leslie Fernandez. And I saw the face, even in the dark I could trace the silhouette of the nose and the eyes and the hair. It was the name that shocked me. I no longer have two brothers, I guess.

I got into the profile and saw what was posted. There was just that darkened profile picture and a cover one of two shadows. It was like my cover picture, maybe. My sibling made the profile just 10 hours before. Just before they fell asleep. Last night.

I took a screencap and sent it to Catherine. "What are you thinking? What do you feel?" "I just wish I hadn't seen it".

She wished that, too.

I let Nymeria come to the bed and we both fell asleep. We stayed there all morning. I didn't get up until after noon. Catherine sent me another message sending me a picture of the back of Anahi's ticket to Universal and asking me what mine said. I got mad. I had told her several times mine expires in December. I would have to explain it again, her issue, her problem agains mine which had gotten worse.

I told her and she apologized. I got out of the bed and took the picture to send her, that would put an end to that topic. Maybe she made me doubt myself. I got out. Did I shower then or did I wait something more?

I was out of the shower when Miguel sent me a text asking if I had taken Nymeria to the vet and would I be able to pick him up. I answered back saying I was just out of the shower and thought maybe I could pick him up and take him with us to the vet. We agreed. I finished and went. I realized that I had just fed her and remember how she pukes. Maybe it would be best to come back for her later.

I picked him up and drove us back home. I put the harness to the dog and the leash. I grabbed the box from the laundry room and got her in the car. We got to the vet without any issue. She was crying the first fraction of the trip. I let her come to my lap while I drove. Something in my gut was telling me it was a bad idea, but she was calm and relaxed. We got there and she didn't throw up. I was called miss and lady in there. They put her last shots and I filled the little certificate.

Before being called, as we entered, there was a kid with his family in there. Did they have a dog or where they just waiting for someone else? He mentioned something about Nyme. And then he told himself how she was a girl. Do people say that of me, too?

I made a stop in the gas station, just minutes before arriving home she threw up on my leg and the car. It was the consequence of not using the box I took.

I went to see my patient. I told Liliana how today got out the application of the master. There is the first date of the test in the capital. 4th of february. Two days before Cathy's birthday. Just as she said, I would not be here to celebrate it with her.

"Maybe I won't be here for my birthday" she commented.

She said she looked at the info and was a little excited at first before she saw the date.

I never stopped feeling nervous and anxious.

## 2016-11-29

I waited before returning to bed and sleeping again.

In my dream I was in school again, I was no longer a child nor was I wearing any kind of uniform. Vinicio was the professor, I can't remember what was the class about. Some of the classmates weren't the ones I frequented on the university. Something happened that the professor started mocking them. Several took it, not too well. They reciprocated physically and violently. I was caught in it, someone stood beside my and let fall unto me the contents of a bag filled with jalapeÃ±os. In rage I got up and ran following him. Somebody in the door said something or tried to stop me and I hit him.

The professor apologized. And then people were called. I woke up.

Again I got up before time. This time I waited in bed. I fed the dog and let her outside. Was my mother gone? No, I saw the two packages of burritos and asked which was mine. I took my pills losing the count of the weeks that have been since the beginning. My mother left and my grandma sat in the couch with me.

"Has Laura talked to you?" "Kinda..." I said ambiguously enough to be able to lose the subject were it to come. "...about Luis", she continued and there was no longer any way out.

She talked. She knows. Edgar knows too. They all think it's about his changes of puberty and all of that. It's confusion or a phase. They are no experts. Even the experts seem to be lost.

"Her friend, the teacher of the school" she is actually a psychologist, one of the experts, "told her, to research if someone in the family practiced black magic"

I was enraged. How the fuck would any professional psychologist dare to enunciate such bullshit to someone who was in crisis?

My grandma continued telling me, asking me if I had seen my mother cry. She was really moved by her session with the psychologist. "She told her that she has to deal with the grief, to 'focus on burying Ivan'". There is something in that sentence that annoys me.

I dealt for months, years maybe, the fight with the urges to really kill myself. I didn't choose to die, I chose to live. I decided to fight to live, to face the world and myself and embrace life with its pains and horrors. And yet everyone's suffering the lose of "Ivan", as if I killed him.

"You took my best friend mercilessly from me" said M. She hates me. Worse, she has just forgotten me.

"I don't agree, 'No, Laura' it's still the same person, we should be thankful that there is no sickness. She is still here, she's the same one, the same personality and everything'" "Edgar says the same, she hasn't changed, everything's the same, he is just she now".

She continued and mention my dad, but that was wrong. "Jose Luis, says the same 'He will always be my son'". Are they saying the same thing? Is he still in denial? Will he ever come out of it?

Would I be able to cut him off were he incapable of seeing me for who I am?

My grandma mentioned how yesterday, before I returned home, she said about my dad how "he just doesn't give a shit". She repeated it again. My father, according to grandma, stayed silent.

I returned to bed around 10 in the morning and slept. I let Nymeria climbed to my side and we both rested and hide from the day. I didn't get up until the afternoon, two hours in the afternoon. Catherine had sent me a message asking me if I was asleep and I answered it. She wanted to invite me to her home to eat. I declined.

She even accepted to bathe Nymeria if I would just take her to her home. I had no energy nor will to do that. I didn't want to shower or get ready. I didn't want to do nothing. I was well-rested and still exhausted.

Later I would ask her if she thinks I've been dealing with all of this in the wrong way.

She told me how she doesn't want to judge, she doesn't know what she would do were she in my shoes. Before this, she could imagine or compare her situation to mine, but now she's blank. She thinks, though, that she'd deal differently with Luis. Were she able to be with them and help or support, she'd do it.

That's the thing, though, I would reply later with tears in my eyes.

I want to, but feel sick and guilty, because I can't.

## 2016-11-30

I'm almost finished with Trigonometry. Two more themes and I'm done. I could continue with Statistics and actually review something that will be in the test. 4th of February. As I told Catherine over tea, I ought to talk with my parents as soon as possible about what am I , are we, going to do next year.

I feel like its another burden with the load they're bearing with right now. Another weight on top of the deal that I brought them at the beginnings of this year. 2016 was a hard year. How will 2017 be?

I woke up and stayed up in the morning. There were no burritos in the kitchen, just the towel-wrapped ones of the table destined to my mom. I checked the pan and noticed how in there was a scrambled egg and some fried beans. I heated one old tortilla and took Nymeria outside. My mom came downstairs and asked if Grandma had made burritos. "To you she did", I answered. She checked inside with the intention of offering me one, but they had cheese. She left, I told it was alright, I had already eaten. I didn't want to eat much, anyway. The dress I wore today was slim fitting. My mom doesn't like wearing dresses. I am not really affectionate of them, but I don't mind them. Catherine loves how I look in them. I like seeing her face when I walked towards there with a really feminine attire.

I showered and changed. I shaved as close as I can. I even shaved my legs and body although I would be wearing long sleeves and hosiery. I painted my nails before stepping into the shower. I had them with a light cream color. They are now a dark red, a crimson wine-like hue. They matched the tights on my legs.

Catherine picked me up half an hour before the meeting with Liliana. Yesterday I made the appointment to this Friday with the new patient. We got there in time, early even. We entered to Lili's office and sat on her waiting office. In the years we've been going there I've sat in different places. When we took Anahi to her first session with her, I waited with Eusebio and Jessica outside on the first floor. Her office was there, on the entrance to the left. Then, when Catherine went, she attended on the second floor on her current office, except the waiting room was now the Family setting where I've actually attended patients myself.

Minutes later she came out from her personal office and not much after, the new recruit entered the door. I told Catherine before arriving how I felt kind of nervous or anxious about something. She asked me if it was because of my session with Rene, but I told her no. "Maybe it's about that a new person will meet you, and is a man?" I remembered her question as he came in and I saw a familiar face. Liliana introduced us, first to Catherine and he said how he knew us already. We were in a rehab class in seventh semester. He extended his hand but put his cheek anyway to greet me.

Did he really recognize me? It was uncomfortable leaving and seeing him talking with Iris. It's probable that he recognized me and knew. Most people would realize there is something with me just with a short exchange of words.

Catherine drove me near Rene and after some minutes of talking, she left me around the corner of the building. I got in and started the session with a yawn. "Are you tired?", he asked me. I talked about my fatigue and lose of energy. I talked about my mother and her session and the stupid comment of her psych friend. I talked about Leslie's new profile and picture. Even the name is something new and weird to type.

Today I saw it again, as her nickname it was written "Les". The similarity of it threw me off guard. That's something I would never had done.

We ate in Hornero, a kind of fancy pizza place next to El Cafe del Mundo. From there we drove to Galerias where I bought Nym's food. I bought two teas with Catherine's money. I gave my name to the cashier and they wrote it on the cups. We talked about everything, even Monica. Maybe I could ask Chevo if he gave Omar the box. I could even ask him if he took a peek, I would not judge him. I might had done the same in his place.

Maybe later.

## 2016-12-01

I am in front of the computer, just after returning from talking with both my grandma and my mother. I was in the couch watching the new episode of The Big Bang Theory when I eavesdropped on their conversation. My mom has now the number of the sexologist. She is not the one her therapist had mentioned. The first mentioned one was a male, a homosexual man who knew since he was a child. Karla Minguela. I've heard that name before. She teaches Sexuality in the Faculty. People love her and recommend her. I guess I am fine with that decision. She mentioned another name, another recommendation, this was for a family constellation. As I heard that I told her not to go to those kind of things.

Without realizing I changed seats from the couch to the table and talked with them. First I mentioned the move to the Capital and then about Luis and therapy. My mom explained about her first session. As I had suspected it, her therapist is a Gestaltist. She made her make contact with the buried emotions that she repressed during my coming out. She told Les while we were all at the table that she had the number already, and asked them when could they go. She mentioned something about calling the next day. Now I can't remember if it was about the sexologist or her therapist.

In the morning I woke up, again, as usual. I fed and took outside the dog. The food left for me in the kitchen were three burritos of flour tortillas. Two of them were folded in half instead of rolled. I opened then and notice how the filling was scarce and barely noticeable. At first I even thought it was just beans and chorizo. I ate two of them and swallowed my pills.

I considered mentioning at the table how Rene had the idea of starting to lower the dosage of the antidepressants so I could leave without any medication. Now he upped it instead. "Why?" would they ask, I anticipated. What has happened? Have I been feeling worse? And then I could mention how everything has been for me. The news about Les and the reaction of everybody and the feeling of having to deal with everything again. And on top of that there's the pressure of dealing with a move and all sort of issues of being alone in a different city.

Did I return to bed? I did. Nymeria spends her nights on her bed and the mornings she sleeps with me. This day it wasn't different. Miguel had told me yesterday if I could drive him to school, he'd be entering later in the morning. At a quarter before eight I put an alarm to nine. If Miguel would need me to take him before that he would wake me, if not, it was a good time. I was the one who woke him up. I drove him there and then return home. Did I sleep again? I think I did. Yeah. I told Catherine how the thought had came tome that the upped dosage had not worked. And then I myself realized the absurdity of the idea after just a couple of hours.

In my dream there was something about that. I took my pills in certain day and realized there were lots in the days before and I wondered if I should take them or not. I knew it would not do any good to take the missed doses, and yet again I swallowed the ones from a day before. Just to notice later that even more days were left.

Talking with Catherine I mentioned, just like yesterday the similarity of the nickname L picked for themselves. Les. Luis. I used it in the conversation and Catherine asked me if it was alright to call them that if we haven't been told to use it. Supposedly we don't even know it.

It's weird using Luis. I feel guilty every time I gendered them in any way. It feels wrong using female ones, and I feel guilty to use male nouns. With the name it's the same. Every time I type it or say it, I feel like somebody else calling me Ivan.

My mom mentioned her friend of the salon as somebody who could help me in my move to the DF. She lives there and I might be use their help staying with them for a while. I don't know how I would feel in that situation. And yet again I cannot imagine what I would do arriving to someone else's asking about rent and presenting in any way.

Just two months.

Less than ten weeks before I am there, before I leave.

## 2016-12-02

I'm home. This morning I didn't have the opportunity to return to bed and sleep some more. I'm exhausted and so tired I could just forget about the words and rest about reality, about everything. I showered as soon as I finished the two tacos my grandma made me and swallowed my pills. For a minute I doubted that my mom would shower as well and someone of us would be late. When I climbed the stairs I saw her in her room already changed. I got in and got ready. When I got out she had already left and I had time left.

I did my hair and put on my face. I picked the clothes and waited until it was just the time. When I was outside waving Nymeria good-bye the phone rang and I read Lili's name on its screen. It was a call to tell me she had left the office open just waiting for me. I got in and sat in the couch. I brought my book. I've been reading it for so long, I have entirely lost to ability to even estimate how much time I've been reading it. I am on the lasts parts of it. I read it sitting in the waiting room until the time of the appointment.

The patient arrived. I see several of Lili's patients the same. She made me think of that other patient I saw.

The interview passed smoothly. Everything went fine. We set up another meeting for next Friday at 10 in the morning. Today my mom was supposed to call the sexologist. Did she? Will she? I told Catherine in the car how I thought that I might be the one who brings L to the sessions. Would I have to enter as well? Will the sexologist be interested in me, knowing about me, knowing me?

The first session my mother will probably be the one in charge of taking them. She'll want to step in and answer the questions of the first interview and clinical history. Will she give the motive or will the sexologist ask L herself.

I don't know. There is no point in wondering about that.

I gave farewell to the patient and read Catherine's messages asking if I had entered already and later if I was out. Had I left?

Back home I sat and watched some television. We agreed that I could pick her up and go somewhere to eat after her session. There was a problem, I misunderstood her when she answered between two and two twenty. I planned to ask her at what time would I leave, but she answered at what time to pick her up.

I left home in a hurry and got four minutes before two twenty. She sent me a message asking to wait for her. I drove to Lili's office and in there she introduced us to a young woman and her granddaughter. The little girl kept looking at me. Did she notice something weird or different? When Catherine entered with her patient, Lili invited me in to chat until her patient arrived. She asked me how I've been doing but I didn't dare to answer truthfully. I talked a little about the pressure of time but that was it.

We went to the Tea house I've always been wanting to go. We asked for an infusion, it was red and we accompanied it with a slice of apple pie. We sat there taking pictures and talking. It was nice.

We left and had the plan of going to eat teriyaki. When we were on our way I confessed how I was not hungry anymore. I don't really remember how the conversation turned towards the DF. She asked in the gas station if we settled about what would we do for our presents for the holidays. My birthday is just two weeks after Christmas and hers is two weeks before Valentine's.

"We won't be together by Valentine's" It was just the reminder that I would be alone by then.

"It's absurd to worry about looking for a place where I can take Nymeria if I will already have to look for a place where they can take me... I have to be realistic and know there's a possibility that I'll be homeless."

Those words kept resounding in my head and I had a stomachache that later turned into nausea. We stopped in a place of Chinese food and I stayed in the car. I told her that it would be better if I came back home.

I didn't know if I would finish the words. I guess I just did.

It's not even time for Nymeria's dinner and I want to lie on the bed.

## 2016-12-03

I have the Khan page of Stattistics in another window just playing the video in the background. At least I can hear the things and concepts that I supposedly already know. For instance, the first video about what questions are statistical and which aren't.

"What do you want for Christmas?..." "For everyone to stop calling me Ivan"

Some months ago I thought about that exchange and what I could answer. It was a little passive aggressive and yet I considered it feasible. Today Luis asked me that question in the car. I stayed silent. I didn't dare to say that. Sometimes words hurt more than we think.

It wasn't the right way. If they ask me again, I'll just say to keep the money of the gifts they would give me and save it for when I pass hunger.

The ideas they gave me, even though they weren't serious, were useless having in mind that I'll leave in some months. They talked about giving me a control to the console of L, and then my mother said about giving me tape to put posters in my room. The room where I'll no longer sleep.

I've change the speed of the videos. I remember reading somewhere about someone talking about Sal's speed of talking and how he watched them at twice its speed. Even at 1.5, I think it's rushed and kind of cheating. 1.25 it's a sweet middle where he talks faster but it's almost unnoticeable.

Yesterday after returning from my date, or day with Catherine, I had a sort of stomachache and nausea. I went to sleep fairly early. I slept around nine or ten in the evening. A couple of hours later my grandma knocked on my door and asked me if I was in bed. I answered affirmative and told them to come in anyway. She said the robe for Nymeria was ready, she would put it on my night table.

I went back to sleep. I dreamed about a school, some sort of boarding school or college town. I lived with Catherine in a kind of room. We slept in two beds, how are they called, that beds that are on top of each other. She slept on the upper one. I was mad at her, or was I upset? Every time that I asked her to do something or being together, she was busy either studying or buying clothes. There were other things. In one I tried to cheat in a text and in other I was looking for some sort of book.

In the middle of the night I heard something outside my room. It wasn't the car getting in the driveway but the rattle of the keys in the door and the screeching of its opening. I was disoriented about time. Was it the next day already? Did I fell asleep? I looked at my phone and saw how it was two hours after midnight. Was my mom just arriving? I fell asleep again.

I woke up around seven in the morning again well-rested. I fed the dog and took her outside. The wind was sharp and chilling. I joyfully felt its grasp on my skin with a smile on my face. I didn't take the pills yet. Maybe my father would bring food, maybe we'd go to the United States. I returned to bed and put the red robe on Nymeria. She looks really cute and formal. I let her climb the bed and sleep with me.

My mom woke me up and asked me if I was going to shower. My brothers were already dressed. My mom and my grandma were sitting on the stairs chatting. I got showered and dressed. I put on the blouse I took off yesterday when Catherine said I looked monochromatic and the crimson jeans.

We crossed the border and went to eat to In n out. I asked for extra spread and enjoyed the cold that bothered both L and my mom. We went to Walmart. I bought a cushion shaped as a hot-dog and a hamburger planing it to give it to Catherine. Before that we stopped at Best Buy. They bought an Xbox for L to open up at Christmas. The seller asked them if they wanted anything else. And looked at me and then said about another controller so I could play with him. Did he see me as a girl? People in the burger place opened the door for me.

In Target I bought a blouse and a dark red hoodie. Luis bought a Pokemon X game, later they said I could have it for Christmas and exchange the pokemon.

That was really nice.

## 2016-12-04

It's been more than a week, has it reached the month?, since I met with Paola for coffee. We talked then about the shop, the course I could offer. The one she proposed on the spot for the next day did not materialize into nothing. She told me to make the poster and start offering on the social pages. Today it's done. She has it now and will upload it in any moment. I feel like when I was in high school and had just finished a flyer or some project, drunk with pride and creativity.

In another tab I finished the process of application for a debit card. I uploaded a picture of my passport and filled their blank spaces with my correct but outdated information. I signed with the mouse and then, in less than 10 minutes, I received two emails with instructions to setting up the page and making the first deposit to receive my plastic.

I told Catherine how the only limit was that I couldn't get deposited more than 15,000 thousand pesos a month. I can surpass that limitation by just uploading a proof of residence or even just my id. I told her as well how I thought the card would have the legal name typed in it. Maybe it won't, I hope it doesn't. It doesn't matter.

When I mentioned the limit she told me that the scholarship would probably not exceed the limit. I answered back saying how by the time that the scholarship would be set I hope to already have made another count with my name. "Why do you want it, then?". I told her it was so people would have a way to make a deposit to my card. "That's a good idea"

I will need a way so my parents can send me money for the first months of being there. Now that I remember the exchange she said it in a jokingly manner. "How much will the scholarship be, like a thousand?". She earns a lot more than me, she earns her salary in dollars. She knows I am sensitive about the frustration of not being able to look comfortably for a job, the fear of being discriminated for who I am. Just now I started to get upset. Should I let my emotions flow or should I try to shut them down? They serve no use to me.

In the morning when I took Nymeria outside I received a message from Lili asking me how I was. She asked me how went the session with Lorena and I answered. She continued if Lucy had contacted me and I told her the truth. I tried to deflect the topic of the conversation giving her the time and dates of my next appointments and mentioning the night of drinks next tuesday.

I went back to sleep after breakfast and let Nymeria climb the bed and rest besides me.

Last night I finished the book I've been reading. American Gods. I had been reading it for months. When I signed into the application where I track the progress of my reading, I came upon a picture of me with short hair and Monica behind my back. That picture is from more than 4 years ago, years before we stopped talking, years before she went to France, years before I went to Spain, years before I transitioned and started living. Years before lots and lots of things. Monica is infamous for the fakeness of her smile, but was mine any more sincere?

I tried changing the name, the picture, anything, but the app didn't let me. I tried logging outside of it, on the browser, but the e-mail or the password was incorrect. I tried several combinations but none was the right one. I let it be and went to sleep. L knocked on my door and gave me the DS with the pokemon card. I formatted the portable console and made my own profile. It was weird trying to represent me with Mii. When I played the game, I put my name in it and the group of fictional friends asked me for a nickname. I gave it to them.

My father gave me the money for the week and my mom the one for the month's therapy and 500 extra. I should go tomorrow to River plaza to make a deposit in the bank and buy the pill cutter. My pill organizer is empty. I should fill it.

## 2016-12-05

I found it extremely difficult to get out of bed in the afternoon. I've been taking the upped dosage of antidepressants and yet I don't think I've noticed a significant difference. I did get up in the morning to take my pills and eat breakfast and feed Nymi and take her outside. I, eagerly, returned to bed and let her climb to my side. Maybe an hour or an hour and a half passed before I actually fell asleep. I know I dreamed something. I dreamed lots of things. Lots of vivid and complicated narratives of a fictional reality.

Yesterday I applied for the debit card. I have the money to pay for the initial deposit. I can do it directly in the bank. It would be really nice not to involve the help of my father or mother. Just tell them I have it and they can deposit to it or use it for my course.

I changed and showered and did my hair. Several times I've wondered if IU'd be able to go out without wearing make up. Today I tried it. I didn't wear any. Not even base or mascara, not a thing. As natural as when I presented as a boy.

I had the information, the bank reference to pay for the master in neurobiology. I had the information to make the first deposit of the card. I needed to buy the pill cutter to stop separating them with my knife. And so, when I was ready, I left the house early to go to the bank and buy the pill cutter. I went to the plaza in front of the hospital where I had surgery more than ten years ago. I parked infront of the bank and got into the ATM. I try to input the information that I had in my phone but it kept asking me the number of the place. Was it some sort of code? I got out of line and tried to do some research in my phone. It was for naught. I tried it again but I couldn't go past it. I left and realized that the bank would close in less than five minutes. I had considered getting in line inside, going for the help of a teller. I went to the pharmacy instead.

I could had bought the Diane pills. They are like 300 pesos. I could ask for them later. I have until next week to buy them. I grabbed the only think in there and went to the pharmacists. There was no other costumer around. I was greeted by the one closest to the cashier and she gendered me correctly. I paid and got out. I returned home.

Paola published the flyer of my workshop. She got the first likes, of one stranger and Catherine. For a moment I was worried that the same outcome of the improvised one would happen. Nobody would be interested, not a single person would attend. Today, after leaving the plaza, I got a message of Paola telling me there were 5 people interested in the workshop, but formally eight.

I think it was yesterday when Catherine asked me if I had stopped looking for a different venue where to give do it. She wasn't all that convinced that Paola's was such a good idea. I looked for the saved link of the offices for rent. They had a room specialized for workshops. I found it. They charge 100 pesos for the hour and need copies of my id, a proof of residence and one of studies.

I doubted it myself. I didn't want to go through the hassle of giving mismatched documents and having to explain myself. In the morning she told me that she was thinking about a group of 20 or 30 people, like the groups of the university, but it was going to be more like 10 or 15. I told her I would love for the group to be as big, but I didn't expected it to be. At first I was actually a little disappointed. "Just 15 people, that's what Catherine expects of me". But then I started making the calculations. 10 people of students would be 8 thousand pesos. That's more than enough of a gain. Even if just five people went I would get around four thousand.

I started to get excited again.

I saw I* for the last session of applications. She spent most of the hour answering the MMPI. Tomorrow will be the party of the office. I won't see Catherine until then. I can still go early to the bank and do the things I have to. I don't know what I'm going to wear. This Friday is the Christmas party of the gang. I have to buy the ingredients and make the potato salad I promised. Wednesday I'll make the list.


## 2016-12-06

I don't know if I'll be here before midnight. If I have to cheat, tomorrow I'll write double.

Party.

## 2016-12-07

So I cheated. I don't really remember the last time I didn't truthfully wrote the seven hundred words. Yesterday I didn't get up until later in the afternoon. I went to shower and to the bank. I did not wear make up the first trip out like on Monday. The trip to the bank was infuriating and annoying. Since realizing the day before that I had gone to the wrong bank I looked for the location of the right one. I noticed how there weren't any in the plaza where I had gone Monday nor in the Galerias one. There was one, however, on the neighborhood two streets to the right.

With time to spare I went yesterday with the three references for the deposits. I got there without a hassle but noticed the parking spaces were full. There wasn't a single one vacant and in front of me was another car waiting for a spot. We were stopped in a red light which not much later turned green. There were cars behind us that took a turn and continued on their way. Three changes of the lights I turned as well and looked for another bank. There was another one near Monica's home. Going to the November 20th I would have to make a left turn before going over the bridge that crosses the freeway. The traffic from the bank to the Nov20 less than a km away took me almost 20 minutes. I missed the turn and had to make a u one passing the bridge. There was traffic on the way back, and, to make everything perfect, there was no fucking bank. In the supposed place where it should had been was instead a car shop. I didn't bother to look around for it, and instead return to the first one I had gone to. I parked the car a couple blocks north and went there on foot.

I got into the bank and saw several atms and two special ones which let me do deposits. I made the first deposit, the 200 pesos to my personal account. There was no problem of unknown information for a unexpected request or anything like that. I filled their boxes with ease. And when it asked me to review all the data, I tried to changed the box of "concept" where lies the description of the transaction. It wasn't needed for that specific deposit, but I did need it for the two of the masters. I decided to wait in line to a teller and ask him to do the deposit. I waited in line. When it was finally my turn, the teller saw me and after hearing my motive, he disregarded me saying "you can do that in the atm". I explained that I needed some info to be on the receipt. "You can do that as well". I told him a little frustrated that I had tried it.

It was uncomfortable, I was annoyed. He gave me my change and the receipts and told me "Have a good day, young man". I left the place, wondering if it was because of the name in the notes or my voice or that I wasn't wearing any make up. I drove back home, and on the way here, a person selling gum approached my window and addressed me as young lady.

I scanned the receipts and already have them on my laptop. I should had uploaded them to the system, but didn't. Just now I'm wondering how many days I have left until the deadline. How much can I pretend that there is no application and no days of waiting and hoping and dreading, no difficulties. Nothing.

I returned home and took Nymeria out for a walk. We walked to the other side. Instead of going right to the park where I once went with my friends of elementary school more than 10 years ago, we went to the left and climbed the hill that I walked every morning for a semester before I learned to drive. We came back exhausted and she lied down half-ly on her bed. Hours passed and I put on make up and got ready for going out with the other psychologists of the office. Catherine told me she could come pick me up. She would drive me back. I took her offer.

She came and I went outside. We drove to the italian restaurant we once went not long ago, and where another time years before we had gone with the gang one thursday after the hospital to eat breakfast when it was another different restaurant.

We got there and the valet parking received us with a "ladies" and took the car keys from Catherine. We walked in just after getting the text message saying they were already inside. Iris and Lili were at the table. Not much later Gilda caught up with us. We ate pizza and pasta. We talked as if we were friends from a long time ago. About the future and our past. Our trips and our memories. Our experience outside the country, Catherine's witness of a catastrophe and Iris hope of meeting a loved one.

Iris said that she had recognized us from sight in our time in college. I had dismissed it, thinking that maybe it was just Catherine. That maybe I look different enough to be separated from him. Yesterday, after the mention of our trip to the National Park of San Pedro Martir, she said that she had gone there with us. Catherine exclaimed with surprise remembering her and agreeing. I stayed unaware. I trust her, but I don't really remember. Later did I feel the awkwardness of being recognized and known. I had met her, I guess. She does know about me.

Hours passed and we drank and talked. We were the last people to leave the restaurant. It was a couple of minutes passed eleven. Catherine drove me home and I got in the house. Nymeria welcomed me with hops of excitement and I carried her in my arms upstairs. I opened the door to my parents bedroom to tell them I was home, but they were asleep. I came back to my room and got ready to bed. I took the make up out of my face and the cloths off. I got into bed and turned the lights off and the night lamp on. Nymeria walked towards her bed in her cute outfit and lied down without even trying to climb to mine.

I looked at her and caressed her. "You are so beautiful and pretty, yes you are, I love you so much", I told her in a sweet voice how I never had imagined I would ever talk. I kept caressing her and my words of love turned to worried laments: "I don't want to leave you behind" My eyes started watering. "I don't want to leave you". I was crying. "Please don't die"...

Where did that come from? What happened?

Not much later I fell asleep.

In the morning, as usual, I got up and fed the dog and took her outside. I fed myself and took my pills. I returned to bed and put the alarm to 10 and a half. Today I would meet with Rene. I tried to sleep and Nymeria climbed the bed. She got really playful the first couple of minutes and then just lied down by my feet. I dreamed some things that I don't remember. The warmth of her body on my legs was really comforting. I had to postpone the alarm several times and didn't got out of the bed until eleven.

I showered but not shaved, not my legs nor chest. I didn't even shaved my face more than a pass with the machine. I barely put something on my hair and let it wild. On my face there was nothing more than moisturizer. I wore a pair of pants that look like jeans and a long sleeved t-shirt that has a hoodie from the time I wore man's clothes.

I looked at myself in the mirror and wondered how manly or feminine I looked. The bra was thin and my breasts were almost not noticeable. My pants were very fitting and the curves of my legs, on the other hand, were fairly obvious. My face looked natural but smooth. It has changed. Nobody gendered me in any way and yet I felt comfortable. I walked to Rene's office and waited for him outside.

In the morning I made public the flyer of the course. More than twenty people have liked it, and several even shared it with their contacts. I put it in the group of the graduates of my class and even there got some views. I gave out some information to several interested people.

Maybe it will be a success. Maybe I will get some money. Maybe I am not really that useless. Maybe I can survive.

## 2016-12-08

After the missing day, I am again at one month. 30 days. My parents are not home. They left maybe an hour ago. My dad came before my mother and he entered with a roses in his hands. When my mom arrived, they agreed to going to the movies. They will probably are going to have sex. If I were in their place I would not really go to the movies, I would go to a nice motel and enjoy the company of my wife.

Yesterday, was it?, Catherine sent me the link of several hotels which charged around three thousand pesos for 5 nights in Mexico city. Double bedrooms. Between each other, that was achievable. A heavy weight was lift from my shoulders. I can now think about and imagine and enjoy the nights with her. The walking around the city. She says she can help me look around for apartments.

Even now that I am writing that, I even forget that I will be doing a test for a future master with a name that doesn't match anymore with my appearance. Lately I've been going outside without any make-up and not really feminine clothes. Yesterday I wore a red hoodie from when I dressed as Ivan. Even today that I went to Wal-mart to buy the beers and the ingredients for the potato salad I went without anything but moisturizer on my face and with a man's t-shirt. I wasn't gendered in any way, but I felt comfortable, I didn't feel no weird looks or comments.

I finally uploaded the scanned bank receipts. I uploaded the ID, too, to the bank site. It appeared a pop up message telling me to remember that a representative of the bank will contact me soon about the request of upgrading my account. I don't even have the card yet. Maybe I should had waited.

I woke up early before my mother left the house. I took Nymeria outside and ate the burritos my grandma made me. There were two packages on the table. Miguel had said yesterday that he wouldn't be going to school today. I returned to bed and let Nymeria climbed to my bed. The first moments when she's up with me, she's all agitated and energetic, moving around and searching my pillows or wandering around my body and scratching herself or digging my sheets. This time was no different.

We stayed in bed until the afternoon. I could had stayed there. I didn't want to get up. I was tired. I wanted to keep resting. I am so comfortable in my bed with Nymeria and nothing to worry or think about.

I read the recipes I found on the internet to the potato salads and looked at the ingredients. Miguel and my grandma eat at the same time, both of them were sleep, too. They ate and offered me something. I showered instead. I thought about wearing this shirt. When I went to give some tutoring to Paola I wore one of the male shirts, as well. Why do I want to tread into the androgynous? Why do I want to test myself? I went to Wal-mart and do some shopping. I bought fruit and onions, I bought eggs. I bought the ingredients for the salad and some even for Luis and my mom to do Tostitos with fruit and Clamato.

I went into the liquor part of the store and grab a 12 of beers. I am drinking on of them right now.

I went into the kitchen and prepared the stuff. I chopped and sliced the celery and green onions. I put the eggs and the potatoes to boil. I peeled the eggs and the potatoes. I cut them and mixed them with the green stuff. I battered the mix of mayo and mustard and stuff. I taste it and was a little disappointed. I let it chill in the fridge while I made myself the beverage that I am almost done with. I ate the two burritos that Miguel left in that second package on the table. I watched some tv, until my father and later my mother arrived.

I've tasted the salad again. The color and look in general changed from that first taste. I grabbed a mouthful with the spoon and tried it. It was better. I could taste the pickles in it. Would the eggs be a problem? Or the onion? What if nobody likes it?

Why did Paola not invite her boyfriend? A thought cross my mind. How would it feel if it was because of me, because we wasn't comfortable around me.

Is that really that possible? Enough to even think about it?

## 2016-12-09

Today is the day of the party, the Christmas party. I woke up un the early morning as usual. I had put an alarm to wake me up by 7, but I think I did not need it. I feed the dog and took her outside. My grandma told me there was a plate of eggs for me in the kitchen. I ate and took my pills. I was awake before my mother left. She told me to put the camera to charge. I did and the tiny yellow light next to the battery started flashing as I plugged the cable in. I let it there and went to get ready. I shaved part of my legs and body without shaving cream. I shaved my face but now I have some black spots around my mouth.

I drove to Lili's office 40 minutes before the appointment. I was by the oxxo when I noticed I had forgotten the tupper with the potato salad for Catherine's house. I came back to pick it up. I stopped by the gas station and put some liters in. The dispatcher didn't gender me in any way. Not that I heard. I got at Liliana's ten, fifteen at most, minutes before the meeting.

Nobody was in, the office was closed. Five minutes passed and I saw the patient getting in the center and walking upstairs with a man by her side. She waved me and I waved back. When she got to where I was standing I told her that we would just wait for Lily to open the office. I extended my hand to her accompanying person and introduced myself. He mumbled something and I thought it was his name. She repeated my name to him "Sofia".

After a couple of minutes she asked me if we were waiting for Lily the psychologist. I replied that yes, we were. "She told me that she would not arrive today until 11."

I had sent Lily by then a text message asking her if she was nearby, but the message stayed unseen. This time I considered calling her again and waiting until an answer. This second time she did pick the phone up. "Sofi, I am on my way". She was not upset nor mad but she sounded serious. I had just told Catherine how I hate being in a position where people depend on me when I depend on other people. Hearing the voice in her answer, made me feel that everything was my fault. Not much after, she arrived.

I applied some tests to the patient and finished the session at the closing of the hour. The ISRA is still unanswered. That could be the next session, would the MMPI be answered later?

She talked more than other patients. The usual last question that gives me an answer of no more than two minutes brought a conversation of almost 10. There were lots of mentions of family and the past. She spoke of the time as something to be dealt with, something that wears you down.

I had told Catherine I could go to her house after the session and accompany her to do the things she has to do. But when I finished the session I went to where Lily was cleaning and from there I could not leave. First she told me to wait and read something she had written. At first I thought it was for some of her closest friends, then she got to the part of our job team. Were we that close to her? I felt both flattered and, something else. It wasn't awkwardness. Was it sadness? No... Later I realized we were mention at the closing. We were addressed separately but noted in her little speech.

I helped her to redact it and send it to people. Robertonni, the other psychologist arrived as well. She introduced us. "Have you met in the university?" I told Catherine how I despised that question and the looks that Robertonni gave me, inspecting me, comparing me to his memories. Did he see me? Wasn't I a man?

I went to Catherine's and stayed at her home for a while. I drove her to the bank but it was way too full. We walked to the pharmacy for her to buy her anti-baby pills. Returning to her home I told her I would be coming back to mine. It's true that I had to confirm that my mom would pick my grandma, but it had something to do as well with her aunt parked there. Does she know about me? Did she see me at her parents' wedding? Would Liam?

I ran. I didn't want to know, not today.

For now I guess I'll sleep an hour before getting ready and leaving.

## 2016-12-10

The day after tomorrow I'll have to give the report of the evaluation to my patient and, before that, meet and start the evaluation with the new patient. She, is her a she?, is the trans patient that Lili told me so long about. Am I nervous about her? Lili talked me about her and asked me if I was ready. And yet, all the other patients are the one that have been harder.

Yesterday I slept a nap after my mother left home with my grandma. I went to bed and put the alarm to wake up at 6:30. Catherine had told me she would be waking up by 6pm. She had to shower and get ready. Easily I'd do easily with 30 minutes more of sleep. When my mom left I put on my black tights and over them the black pajama pants. I stayed in the black tank that I wore under the hoodie.

I closed and opened my eyes. It was dark and I was disoriented. I postponed the alarm clock thinking I had just rested 10 minutes. I was so tired and the headache hadn't subsided. Slowly I came back to my senses and realized the time it was. "It wasn't such a good idea to sleep" Catherine replied telling me she hadn't sleep at all.

The time we would meet at Paola's was going to be around 8. By then, the idea of asking for a ride from my parents was out. I would have to ask for an uber to take me there. I put six bottles of beer to a sack and put the potato salad outside the fridge. I put on my dress and applied my make up. My hair was messy but not that much. It was acceptable. Not enough to make me shower.

Talking with Catherine I asked her if her parents would drive her, and if they would, would they pick me up. She didn't know. She could ask them, her mother specifically. If she declined, or said something, maybe she could just let her at my house and from there we could share an uber.

An hour passed, around 7, or some minutes before 8 she told me they were on their way to here. Miguel was asleep on the couch. I fed Nymeria around 8 and put a note on my door. I felt ill, tired and the headache was light but annoying. Catherine's mom and mine came almost at the same time. When I received her text message notifying their presence, I left to meet my mother parking the red SUV. I waved and walked with the bags and tupper. "At what time will you come back?" Is it dusk or dawn? Which one is the breaking day and which is its end?.

I got into the car and Catherine asked me to step down again. We put everything on its place and left. I was nauseous on the way to Paola's. We arrived and Paola was inside. Paola S was with her as well. We chatted for a while and Diego, Paola's son, came out.

We told them about the date of our departure. February second. It's closer than ever. Having the date is pressuring. I see pictures of people in their trips, Gabriela in the city with her boyfriend, Sara coming and going from there, Hilda on her occasional trips. Why am I so nervous? Andrea, Ariel, Ivan, Paloma, lots of people went to stay, just as me. They made it. They came back, they loved it.

I did so, too. I went to a different country, I travelled to another continent. I was a foreigner and I made it.

None of us were trans. None of us had an id with a different name and a picture significantly different than how we looked.

I'll do it. I'll make it. I have to.

Rafa, Andie's boyfriend called. Chevo and Jessica were on their way. We moved downstairs and dinned. All of us were so hungry. The food was so delicious. But it tired us. It brought us down. We smoked and drank. We talked and laughed. We exchanged gifts. I gave mine to Rafa. I received from Paola S. She gave me a beanie hat and a bottle of wine. Cathy received a pair of cute loafs and Jessica loved her sweater.

It was a fun night, but my headache did not leave. We were the last to leave. Even Paola went upstairs before Chevo and Jessica and Cathy and me.

We cleaned up and waited for the uber to pick us up. Chevica waited with us. I got home and fell asleep before Catherine got to hers. I invited Nymeria to my bed and sleep through the night. In the morning she was the one to throw up instead of me. A blue rubber band tied some of her leftovers from her stomach. I threw it to the thrash and cleaned the sheet. We slept again until three in the afternoon that we got up for good.

In the morning Luis came to my room and asked me if I was going to the United States. I didn't even think about it before I declined. I think they bought some of the Christmas gifts. Grandma went as well. It's just less than a month that my sentri is valid. Just until my 24th birthday.

## 2016-12-11

Again I almost forgot about doing the words. Just now I'm returning from an open Excel workshop where I'm editing the appearance of the spreadsheet to interpret the psych tests. The flyer of the course is still online and I am still receiving some likes. People are interested but they don't pay or ask for the inscription. I am thinking about setting up some sort of offer. It's the Holidays. I could offer 20% off until the end of this year. That is an incentive to actually pay. There is a benefit for doing it before a certain date. And once you have made a payment, you force yourself to actually attend.

Even now I am still nervous. I fear that the day will come and I will have to cancel it because nobody will attend.

Yesterday I thought about sending a message to my patient to postpone tomorrow's meeting. It's the final one where I am going to give her the results of her evaluations. Tomorrow I'll pick Luis up. Tomorrow is the day when my parents will meet the sexologist as well. Had I forgotten about it? Am I nervous because of that?

I didn't want to sit and actually work. I don't have the motivation to finish grading the projective tests and redacting the report. This time I won't be having Lili by my side. This is my personal patient, I can do and say whatever I want. The only person that will judge me is her.

Today I woke up early in the morning and not much later my dad arrived with breakfast. I took the pill case and noticed how there wasn't no pink round pill. The Diane pills ran out yesterday and not today as I had thought. I skipped them for today. The first months I skipped them for four days. One won't do nothing. In a couple of days I will have to go to the lab to get my blood drawn. A week, maybe.

I remember years ago when even the thought of having to go to a place to be injected gave me panic attacks. Now it's just another appointment, other thing that I have to do. December is running out faster than all the other months. We're almost at its middle.

I drank a bottle of beer as I finished writing the conclusion of the report. The warmth of the drink as time passes brings me back the memories of the small caÃ±as and their taste on the terrazas when we would go out with Raul and Alberto to the park or for some pinchos. Did I drink to forget? Forget what? By then nothing had happened. Nothing at all. Then it was just the fear of what was ahead. I didn't lose anyone, I didn't confront nobody nor show myself to anybody. Then I enjoyed it. No, sometimes I did, like those. Other I wanted to drink to oblivion. When I went to the last botellones, or in Portugal as I danced with Monica's ghost.

It was returning that I pretended to be alright, that I buried everything deep enough and sealed it with the effects of alcohol.

Do I want to avoid L's situation the same way? I've been talking with Rene about approaching him. I don't dare to.

There are gifts wrapped on the stools of the bar in the kitchen. Yesterday they went to the United States and bought them. I saw several clothes. There was a box of several bottles of nail polish. Was it for my mom? She doesn't have much. Maybe they bought it for me. Even now as I'm typing I have my nails as red as wine. Sometimes I forget. I remember months ago that I worried my hands would catch much attention because of it. Now they seemed totally normal.

I asked my dad to buy me some Diana and antidepressants pills. He bought them when we went for the food. Is it me symbolically asking him to erase the man he thinks I am? He buys me the medication that I use to block the testosterone.

I've finished the report.

Yesterday, or was it the day before that?, I started looking for and downloading the music I've been listening in Spotify. More than 100 files are now in my Downloads folder. Now there are just three unfinished files and 5 connections that never even started. Should I delete those or just let them?

I like having the songs on my ipod.

The book is still unread. I have progressed more than as I used to with the other one, but it's not enough.

## 2016-12-12

All but three files have been downloaded. There is just one who's still not achievable, the other two are just incomplete.

I woke up in the early morning and Nymeria climbed my bed to get under the covers. I felt her warm body next to mine. I slept for another hour. Right besides me is my mason jar filled with beer and clamato. I don't have a reason to drink, I just fancied the taste. It's weird typing the daily words without a back sound, be it the music of the computer, or the conversations of the tv show that somebody watches in the living room. Just Nymeria and me are on the first floor. My parents returned but they are on the Oxxo. They went to buy eggs and tortillas.

I can hear their voices on the porche. They've arrived. They are here. "Do you want to go out?, do you want to go outside?" My father tells the dog playfully. He likes her. He said he didn't want any dogs and yet he cares for her.

I fed the dog as we got out of bed and I looked for some food on the kitchen. There were no packages of food, neither on the table nor next to the stove. In the napkin there was a stale tortilla and behind it a cold burrito wrapped inside a ziploc bag. I ate it. I tell myself I eat breakfast because of the pills, but really I am hungry. Do I deny my emotions as I do my wants and feelings?

We went back to bed to make use of the short time before I had to get ready to meet my new patient. I let her climb to my side and we both fell quickly to sleep. I showered and shaved.

I had mentioned to Catherine the weirdness of seeing my genitals. I described how in my morning routine, even before getting ready, even looking just as I get out of bed with my messy hair and puffy eyes, I look into the mirror and like what I see. I brush my teeth and find pleasing the image of the girl brushing, of the face behind the dry and frizzed curls. I take of my clothes and see the beginnings of curves, the subtle breasts that hang from my chest, the broadness of my thighs getting slimmer as approaching my feet. It's not until I take off my underwear that I see it, that I remember how I was born, how I should look or act or be.

This morning was different. I saw all of the barely noticeable traits of masculinity that are left, and every step of the way I kept thinking of what I didn't realize until seeing my genitals.

I met the patient. Were they a trans woman or man? I had assumed them to be a woman, Lili kept referring to them as feminine, the contact she passed me said Lucy. When she introduced us, they said that name themselves. I asked the question that some wouldn't had dared. "So, you are trans...". Even after some answers and half of the interview I kept thinking of him as a trans woman. It wasn't until he mentioned seeing himself and Lucas and liking that name, that I realized my mistake.

Some things should had touch some nerves in me. There were several parallels in his story to mine. The ages, the episodes, even some words. Everything went fine. I asked him, how he felt, how was it, the interview, me, everything. "Fine, good. I was really excited. I've never met somebody like me before."

Was I so noticeable? Is it that obvious? I felt the question grow in my throat but I grasped it. "So Lili told you since before", he just nodded and continued. We agreed on the price but he apologized for not having the money.

I came home. I felt energetic, motivated. I liked it, talking to someone like me, feeling experienced and helpful, even though I did nothing but listen and ask questions.

The Last man on earth was on the Tv when Miguel sent a message. He was asking if I were busy or if it was possible for me to pick him up. Even now, after months, I still feel weird when I read him use the feminine pronouns.

When we returned my mom was home. She said how she saw my aunt, my dad's sister. Maybe it was the picture of their anniversary or the change of appearance of my dad but my aunt asked a question that made my mother say how things have been difficult. They talked about how none of his siblings has reached out to him. It's hard for him. I had suspected it, known it, yet it was reassured when my mom told me how after asking him if he wanted to share a cake with them or visit, he said no. He didn't want to see them.

I went for Luis and entered his school. There was the principal and he recognized me. We stopped at the pharmacy before the office. I introduced him to Lili before my patient arrived. I delivered results and got paid. My parents didn't return until an hour after us.

Even now, I've been thinking about going out and asking my mom how it was, how their session went.

Is it that I don't want to, or that I don't dare to?

My grandma has come downstairs and sat with her. They're whispering. Is it that?

## 2016-12-13

Even after years, I never finished passing the journal I kept on my phone to the notebook. I think the last days I have are from my trip to Portugal. When I used to write manually the journal of when I was in high school, and meeting Monica, every time I would get caught up un the mood I had writing the text. Passing the scripts caused me numerous arguments and fights with my ex.

I am trying to fill the agenda that I bought on my birthday. Was it my birthday? It was in Playas, the Office depot next to the movies. The last day I have in there is from the mid of September. I have some batches ahead, but that's from where I should continue. I've closed the agenda now. Catherine and I are talking about tomorrow. Jhonny will have a concert or festival or something. We agree to go. This time I do want to go. The last time I wanted to. I can't remember why I cancelled it just one or two days before. I thought about returning from my therapy session to her house and be with her. I propose her that I could left my car in there until we return from Jhonny's and then I could go back home. Or she could pick me up. She said no, it's not possible. She has to come early to her home and I can't leave the car because they have to move it to put the truck in.

Moments now she asked me in which hotel we stayed when we went to Universal Studios. My parents just left to go to the bank.

I get this weird feeling when she mentions the park. We talked about going, the three of us. We talked about it since when I went with my family in April when she had her surgery. My ticket expires in a couple of days. We never really concreted the plans. Some weeks ago Anahi invited her to go the ninth. She felt bad that she could not go that day either because it was the day we all agree to meet for the Christmas party of the gang.

Catherine had told me she wanted to go with me and or her family, but going with Anahi felt weirdly uncomfortable. A couple of days ago she talked about buying the yearly pass when she goes with her family. I felt sad and disappointed. Why should she buy it if we're going to go to the capital in just two months?

Right, she returns.

I had the idea that I'd be going to the endocrinologist December the nineteenth. Chatting with Catherine I wondered what day could I stop by the lab to get my blood drawn. I could go Thursday or Friday, so I wouldn't go the weekend or have a problem with the results not being on time by the session.

I grabbed the order of the lab for something, and then mistakenly opened the prescription where the date of the appointment is written. It's noth the 19th but the 16th. It's not next Monday, but this Friday. Today is Tuesday. The tests are almost always the same day. But, what if they're late? I have to go tomorrow to the lab.

Moments before Rene called to postpone the session. Instead of going out at noon I will have to leave earlier than usual. I'll have to wake up in the early morning, like by 6 and get ready so I leave just after feeding the dog. What should I wear? What can I wear to Jhonny's? I thought about wearing a dress. Maybe the gray one with the long sleeves. Won't it be hard to free my arm for the needle? I won't make the same mistake of the first time that I went with androgynous clothes. I don't even want to see doubts in their eyes that I am a woman.

Thursday I'll see Rene and I can talk about my parents' session, or that the date is set for Luis to go. I can mention me taking them with me to the office or the misunderstanding of the dates of the appointment. It's just a little more than a week until Christmas. This Friday I'll meet the doctor and will have to tell him about my move. Will he recommend me to someone else? Will he ask me to return to meet him?

Why am I nervous?

The year is ending. Time is faster than ever.


## 2016-12-15

I cheated again in the words. Yesterday I was at the bar, sitting besides Catherine when I grabbed the phone from my purse and copy/pasted the word "cheat" while Jhonny was singing. Or was he still backstage and we were waiting?

I woke up early, earlier than usual, and showered. This time I applied make up. I wore a dress and boots. It's weird, when I catch myself in the moment living the experience of wearing tights and a dress, the flow-y cloth over my legs. I drove to the lab and got in. I would never believe the calmed I could be waiting to be called for my blood to get drawn. I even pay them. I walked towards the cashier and answered her questions. It felt amazing seeing how she wrote "female" on the gender box. I look female, I am a woman.

I don't really remember too well what I did yesterday. I have the agenda next to me, I filled today and yesterday. Then I could not remember and thought I needed this, now I feel the other way around. I was back home and ate breakfast. I would go out with Catherine, but not until later in the afternoon. I went to her house and picked her up. We made a stop at the exchange house and swapped seats. We decided to eat japanese food, Teriyaki and Yakimeshi.

I got distracted. I was on Facebook looking for Johana. Is that her name or was she called joanna? No, one was Monica's friend. The one I am thinking of had short hair, shorter than hair. She was tall and slimmer. She wore jeans every time she could, when the weather made the principal's office permit women to wear jeans like the men. Sometimes she would even look weird in her skirt. She wasn't really mocked or bullied, but people call her "the guy" behind her back. Usually people I disliked myself, sometimes people like Roger who called her group of friends the X-men, because of being geeky.

After seeing my patient I thought of her. Is she really a she? Her best friend, or the closest one I saw her with called her Johan. I never really related it or wondered if she were trans. Even after my own transition, I didn't really thought of her until Lucas explained to me that even though he hasn't asked his friends to use that name, his best male friend calls him Luke.

After eating we stopped in the River Plaza where we went to the movies. Christmas Party, was the movie we saw. It was nice, a nice time. Straight from there Cathy drove us to the bar where Jhonny would sing. I ordered a beer and she a drink with Clamato. Jhonny songs made me cry a little. I wanted to hug Catherine and feel her close to me. In my way back home after letting her at her house, I was stopped by the police checking for drunk drivers. I lowered the window when the car ahead of me was leaving. The officer didn't wave me off. He approached me and sniffed, "Did you drink alcohol tonight?" "No", I lied. There were just two bottles, but I know that's enough to tip me off. I wasn't drunk, I was driving just fine. "Where are you coming from? ...The Christmas party?" I giggled and replied no. Maybe it was because of the clothes I was wearing. "School?" Do I look that young? Well, people way older than me were with me at the university. I told him the truth, but he didn't hear me. He got closer. "I come from seeing a friend sing", I said making a microphone with my hands, mimicking jhonny's show. He let me go.

I went straight to bed.

No, I checked the results. I told Catherine how I felt uneasy about it. I was nervous, but not really sure about what. I opened them and saw there were not much over the limits. At first it was just uric acid, but then I saw the usual outliers. Cholesterol, Sugar levels. The last one was the most disconcerting. Testosterone. Last time I checked it lied at 0.28. Now it was 1.02. Almost twice the upper limit for a woman.

I felt sick, sick inside. I told Rene how it was like having this unwanted substance inside my body and I can't do anything about it.

Today I didn't wake as early, but it was still tiring. I went back to bed after the morning food and shit. I showered and got ready. I neither shaved nor wore make up. I even tried a male long sleeved t-shirt at first. But it was way too manly. I wore instead a pink t-shirt and over it a red hoodie. I felt fine until I looked at myself in the mirror after exiting my session. I saw the black hairs on my chin and upper lip.

The girl of the Oxxo recognized me again. I paid the bottle of soda and she told me how it was a miracle and how I've been doin'.

I stopped on the supermarket to buy the dog's food.

Today in the evening I hear the doorbell and thought it was my father. I opened the door and Nymeria walked out. It wasn't them but a courier. He asked for Jose Ivan Fernandez. Was he looking for him or was he confirming? Anyway I just nodded and he gave me a little machine to sign while I had the dog on my arms. In the envelope came my card. I activated it on the internet. I'm supposed to call on the phone but I'm not really sure I want to.

Tomorrow I'll se both the endo and then my patient.

I am scared and nervous. Will I explain my plans to him?

## 2016-12-16

I'm lying on my bed under the covers. I have already changed clothes into my black and cozier pajamas. The lights are off and Nymeria is asleep on her bed out in the living room. I'm tired and sleepy.

I'm writing the words in my phone incase I fall asleep and don't want to get up to do them. I worried about the level of my hormones and the results of my blood tests.

I woke up at the hour I was supposed to. I can't remember if it was before or because of the alarm clock. I showered and wore the clothes I chose yesterday. I would see Catherine in the afternoon. This time I decided to wear makeup. I wanted to look nice and feminine for the endocrinologist. I wanted him to notice the changes.

I looked fine, I like how I look, how I feel with myself.

I had all ready for both my appointment with the doctor and my patient. I left with everything and got into the car hiding under the rain.

I turned it on and when the little lights flashed I remember the times it cried with a buzzing alarm telling me there was a problem with the radiator or the water.

I returned to the house for a big glass of water to fill the car with. I unless dispensed it to its valve and got into it again.

I was just talking with Catherine telling her that I should be leaving in case there were traffic on my way there because of the rain. I was leaving the private drive and just turned to up the hill when the levels of both the speed and the revolutions died and fell to 0. instinctively I moved to the side and tried to turn it on again with no avail. I tried one more time with the same result. Two, three times as if suddenly it would get back to normal and everything would turn alright.

I had half an hour until the appointment. I called my dad and explained everything to him. He sounded a little shock but I didn't realized what he could had heard when he answered the phone and the first thing I said was "the car just died"

He said he'd be coming in 15 minutes.

I sent him a message telling him that I would not be arriving to my appointment with the doctor. In the phone call he asked me if I wanted to take an uber. I told him that u couldn't let the car in the middle of the road.

He arrived 5 minutes before my appointment. He tried to pass charge from his battery to mine wit jumper cables. It was useless. We moved the car to the side, first he did using the gravity and its weight from the uphill. He got halfway just from that. Next we pushed it into a U turn, when I got in and he pushed me with his pick up. We made it to the parking lot. He gave me a ride to the hospital and I signed in and got into the office. The secretary recognized me and told me, "you are very late, Sofia" I apologized and tried to explain that my car just died. "it's fine, take a seat"

The doctor passed me fifteen minutes later. How I've been, how I've been feeling, how's everything.

He weighted me and made notice of my gained weight. He took my heart pressure and my sugar levels, when he put the heart monitor on my chest he noticed my cleavage and moved the blouse to peek. He said the development was going very well, there was good volume.

The tests came ok, my blood is normal. He upped my dosage, I won't be resting the hormones anymore and I'll take double the spiro.

I left and paid. The uber I took to my office asked me if I was new using the app. Almost nobody has 5 stars, just the new users. I answer instinctively that I was not, and then thought about it. I've taken several trips, here, when we return from parties, all of the going outs in mexicali, those times that I had no car.

My patient waited for me fifteen minutes and we waited for lili another quarter.

I thought I could wait for Catherine to see her patient and then let her took me home. The patient cancelled and I called my mom to pick me up. After sending her a map and then guiding her over a phone call she arrived. We talked a little about their session. It was the first time that my father called me Sofia.

She told me why was she upset that Luis hadn't told her themselves, "I asked him, he said 'because I didn't want you to think I was a cheap copy of Sofia"

## 2016-12-17

Today will mark the 50 continues day again. Though, do I really deserve to be proud about that accomplishment? I cheated a couple of nights ago. Last times I considered doing double the words the next day to compensate, maybe that would be fair and enough. This time I didn't. I continued writing but stopped halfway. Yesterday was it that I did the words in my bed under the sheets with the intention of not having to get up later and being able to fall asleep right there and then.

Was then the day after the night that I went with Catherine to see Jhonny?

I'm eating hot bread with two slices of bologna in the middle. I keep thinking about the meeting with the endocrinologist and how I am overweight. I gained 5 kilos. I do have been eating more than usual. Is it the anxiety? All my life eating has been a way of resting, having an excuse for a break and free time. While I am eating, that is something I must do, I don't have the guilt of being procrastinating. Some times in my past I don't doubt I use it as a way of filling a void that I fell inside.

"Has it happened to you that you dream something and don't remember it later?" asked my grandma to Miguel in the morning. "All of the time".

I dreamed something today. It was a continuation of another old dream. I lived it and thought that it would be an amazing story. Something about returning to a different timeframe. I don't remember much of the details. There was a villain that had a big corporation of food, that used corpses as a main source. In another scene, I was part of the crew directing a movie or a tv show. I wasn't the director. The protagonist resembled one of the characters in the kid's show that I sometimes watch. She wasn't a gem projecting a humanoid form like in the cartoon. She just share the basics of her image. But there was something different. In the show she had a dark red wig of long and braided hair. I noticed her when she didn't wear it how her hair was straight and short, just brushing the edges of her face. It was framed by the black locks, and her freckles on her pale and snowy skin. I stopped the run of the scene and told her to take of her wig. She just had shared a moment with her significant other. Was I jealous? Would I had wanted to be hers?

I don't remember much more.

I got out of bed at seven o'clock. I fed the dog and let her outside. We returned to bed. In the middle of the night, just past midnight, I heard the sound of the door and a car leaving. My father didn't return until nine with breakfast. The idea of going to the United States was discarded. I don't mind. I can't imagine how it must be not sleeping a whole night at my father's age. Even now, at my own youth, I find it so hard to stay awake. I slept after breakfast for another three hours.

We didn't do anything. My father went to buy meat and we ate all at the table at the same time. A family dinner. I went upstairs to my mother's bedroom and both Luis and Miguel later got in, as well. My mother told me, my father had asked her what could they give me for Christmas. She asked me if I wanted a gift or would I prefer having some money deposited to my card in case of emergency or anything. I would not find a job soon. I don't even know if I would even look for one. I think of that and I get nervous and anxious. I will be alone. I don't know where I will live. I maybe should contact the agency that offers stay for LGBT people. I might have to start looking and browsing the roommates page of rents. Maybe after new year, a month before my departure.

Time keeps running as fast as ever. I should be starting to redact the letter of motives and polishing my resume to upload all of the papers. It's the master of science that I have until the first week of january to upload them. The other one I won't have to until I pass the test.

"How are you?" is just asking me Catherine now.

"Fine", I think, but that's a lie.

I'm nervous, and a little scared


## 2016-12-18

I bought a set of pajama pants red of Gryffindor. When I saw them I immediately thought of Catherine. We haven't chatted much today.

I woke up a little after seven. The cold was sharp and piercing. Like an ice prick that penetrates the clothes. We returned to bed and slept for another while. My father showered and came down. There was no breakfast. The plan since yesterday was that we would take DoÃ±a Cande to the bus station and from there we would cross the border to the United States.

I showered before my mother. I went upstairs and my father was changing clothes. I wore the pants that look like jeans, over them, the gray loose hoodie. I didn't bother to wear any make up. I reheated the biscuit from yesterday and ate it with my pills. I should separate the ones for next week. There is no need of resting anymore. I have to find another way to count the months. Just December, January and then the next month will be in another city. Will I have my anniversary of hormones in the capital, too?

We were in the US when my father asked some questions about the tests. Was he really interested? Did he have an ulterior motive? "When do you have the first exam? From which master program is it? And when is the second? Which one is the one you want the most?"

I can't stop thinking about two days ago when my mother told me that my dad called me Sofia for the first time.

Miguel called me Sofi when he tried to catch my attention. My father questions were in Hot Topic, and it was getting out of there that they walked towards Macy's.

Chula vista plaza was not the first place we went to.

Even though I am narrating today's itinerary I keep thinking about changing the appointments with my patients. I won't probably be able to see L this Friday because Lili said she would work until Thursday. And then, Monday that I am supposed to see L, I will be in Mexicali. Tomorrow I'll send Lili a message asking her about Friday. I will send two to my patients. I think about offering them to see them another day or just postponing them until next week.

Crossing the border we went to 5 guys. The last time we went there was almost two years ago, when Miguel was in Comic-con. My mother remembers that place as the one where they have peanuts and you can grab as many as you like. It's weird being in Hillcrest around my family.

We didn't take Cande to the station. We reconsidered taking her after returning so she could stay with Nymeria. And now that we've returned, she says that she'll go tomorrow.

Tomorrow my mom will take L to their appointment with the sexologist. I am more nervous than they are. We played two games of chess in their room. The first one they won and the second one, too. I am not as bad as I think, but they're way better than I would had thought. Before that I was in the restroom. I had seen a post in Facebook of a T-man who posted a picture of him before and after transition, he invited everyone else to share theirs, too, in the comments. I had seen the post when it didn't have any comments. I considered posting mine. I don't have earlier pictures than this year's. I had an idea. I have myself added in Facebook, I could snoop in there the older pictures from when my hair was shorter. I knew well that I won't be posting anything but it was more for myself than anything.

In Macy's, my mother caught up with us. She invited me to go see the women's section with her. It still feels a little strange buying clothes with her. I found several things. She did as well. When we finally return after she showed me a cardigan she had liked for me, she told me how Luis picked trousers just like my dad's. "That's what confuses me so much". I mentioned how it was similar with me, my clothes in high school, but she didn't seem to hear.

I took a picture of me while I waited for Nymeria to shit. I should clean her feces that are just outside the door. Done. I have changed. I look different, nice.

My father gave me the money of the week. Maybe I'll get the extra one from the sessions, if I don't postpone them.

## 2016-12-19

Today is the day of the first session of Luis. I don't know what happened in there, I don't know what was said or what new has developed. What happened besides that today?

I have red marks of the scratches of both teeth and nails of the dog. She's so caring and affective and yet at the same time so full of emotion and childish anger. Was it last night or the one before when she climbed the bed and yet some time after returned to her own? Did I feel abandoned?

Catherine told me today how she's planning of going to the doctor tomorrow. She doesn't feel very well. She's been experiencing nausea and a ringing in her ear. Now as I type this I wonder if going to the kitchen for something to drink is a good idea. I think I'm beginning to feel a soreness in my throat. I'm getting the hang of rating the songs. I'm almost finished with this album. The School. The song that was the reason I downloaded this band is the last one. I deleted the other album I had gotten.

I slept again after taking the dog outside. I ate my breakfast and took my pills later in the morning. It's weird not being lonelier in the house. Almost everyone was here. My mom, my grandma and Luis. They had talked about taking my grandma to Mexicali today instead of yesterday. The wind ran furious and piercing. It was like an ice dagger that passed through clothes and bones. I guess that is why they decided to try something else. My mom sent a copy of the prescription to my uncle. He could try to exchange it in the hospital there. It didn't work. Tomorrow they will try going to a clinic here.

I sent the messages and arranged the appointments. I sent a message to L, my male patient, that I would not be able to see him this monday and if it would be possible to arrange another appointment this week. He said it was no problem, could it be Friday?

There was a problem, I didn't know yet if Lili would work that day. I was thinking about setting him and asking my other patient if I could see her Thursday, too. Maybe if I put her to 10 and him to 11, I wouldn't interfere with Iris at noon. Lili answered the message back telling me it was no problem and she could open the office for me in the morning. So it was all set and done. It was even a little hard to believe it myself. And then the patient sent the question. Would it be possible if we could lower the price to 250?

He wouldn't be the first one to pay me that much. Why was it so hard for me to accept? I had thought about cashing the 300 pesos from him. They would be all for me. And yet it was done, and I could not accept it. I told him that 300 was the lowest I could go, and asked him again if he had problems getting that amount. He said he had, but it was no problem. It was done, I wouldn't be losing it, and yet... why did I feel defeated?

It's almost Christmas. The day after tomorrow I will be turning eight months on hormones. The days I have left until the deadline for uploading the documents are fewer and fewer. I haven't even started to think about what I'm going to write in my motive's letter. What motives do I even have?

Thinking about writing in the masculine and signing it with my name feels so wrong and difficult. Yesterday in the United States my mom showed me several formal pants in the women's section. I saw them but not considered buying them. Does she know I have to wear them for my interview? Maybe I can set it up to being online, that way they would only be chatting and seeing me from my chest up. Will be breasts be bigger? Enough to be unnoticeable?
It depends on everything, what happens in the capital, how the getting into and out of the test goes. It's just all too much.

I told 11 I would be going the day of their birthday. I had mentioned yesterday, but they thought I was joking.

Will they, all of them, really miss me? Who will miss whom the most?

## 2016-12-20

Catherine came and went. Yesterday we agreed of meeting today, we could do something cheap without paying anything. She came with the idea of coming home, but rectified herself saying she knows how I am not really comfortable staying home. It was yesterday in fact that I passed several weeks to the agenda, just that same week or couple of days of cancelled meetings and gatherings and postponed plans and void days. It was like a confirmation of that reaffirmed memories. I don't feel the same way. I told her it was fine. Today after showering I told Luis about moving the wii downstairs, maybe we could all play together.

It was a fun day, Luis was more talkative and open. All of us had fun. She brought a jicama and we chopped the fruit to mix it with the chips and the clam juice. We mixed the juice and some sauces with the beer. I just now remembered that I left half of a bottle in the fridge, could I grab it and drink it? Alcohol is not good for losing weight. I've been eating less these last few days. I put on one of the sweaters my mother bought me in Macy's. I wore it today with the red leggings. Catherine told me, as soon as she saw me, that I looked weird, different. Later in the day when I told my mother we would go out she asked me if I was going to leave "like that".

I got really distracted. I am just returning from playing with Luis and opening the chat with Cathy. Luis was just here talking and laughing, I had to kick them out so I could continue with my words. Tomorrow we might go to Costco according to my mom. I had thought how I didn't really want to get ready and go out.

I keep forgetting and thinking that tomorrow is when I'll see Rene. It's not. I won't see him until Thursday. My car is still in the mechanic. Tomorrow then we will probably go to the Costco to buy my grandma her medicines and probably use the opportunity to refill mine. Thursday I will go to Rene, I don't know if I'll ask my mom to give me a ride or lend me her car. This Friday I'll see my patients and go out with Catherine somewhere to eat and exchange gifts.

I keep drifting away, when it's not the music and the recently downloaded songs, it's looking for something on the internet, or, like days before, scrolling through the pictures un the albums inside of my computer.

Again I drifted and started playing the songs I already know or recognize and use the little tool that gathers the lyrics from the web and shows me which are the most popular songs of that artists. From there I pick the ones I have and listen to them for the first time. I see the blank stars as something to fill, a to-do, a task that's still undone and waiting.

I wish to just get up and change clothes. I want to wear my pajamas and lie on the bed. Nymeria is finally asleep on hers.

Catherine got here around two, after I had played twice or three times chess with Luis, one of them was with the clock he likes so much to use. Then I asked him to play checkers and won most of the sets. We played videogames and ate. She told me herself how Luis seemed more open. The afternoon past quickly. It was then that we went to the burger place of Hollywood looks. Both me and Catherine entered first and one of the cooks or waiters said "Welcome, girls". It was reassuring and calming. We didn't find a parking spot in front of the joins so Catherine kept driving another block and left the car there. I used the vanity mirror and looked at myself worried of how I looked. I am wearing feminine clothes, a girly sweater over red jeggings. But I am not wearing any make up and my shaving wasn't spotless.

Four days until Christmas. Tomorrow is twenty-first, Thursday and Friday and we'll go to Mexicali. "What are you going to wear?", asked me my mom. My brothers and father are going to wear pants and a shirt. What am I going to wear indeed? I thought about wearing the red blouse she bought me, and then again I could wear the gray dress. Maybe I'll wear one this Saturday and the other the Sunday.

I still have to decide what am I going to wear to see both of my patients and Catherine. I should try to look pretty for her. Looking pretty, when would I ever imagine that I would be worrying about that, or even enunciating those words?

## 2016-12-21

This was supposed to be an unworthy day where nothing would happen and I'd do nothing. I wore for the firs time the artesanal sweater Catherine's parents brought me from their holidays in Zacatecas. As soon as I put it on I realized it wasn't such a good idea. The weather for today wasn't as windy nor cold as the past few days. Before that, a little after eating the three tacos my grandma had prepared me, I was still in pajamas when my mother said that Miguel had just sent her a message asking if she could go pick him up. My father said something yesterday about leaving the pick up and taking with him the Mitsubishi as the brake plates were squeaking and really worn down.

I guess she forgot about it because it was a surprise to her that she would be driving the pick up. She asked me to take it. She accompanied me to show me the way. We left the house both in our sleeping garments. "I think I'm not even wearing a bra, she said to me" "Well, me neither", I thought about saying, but decided not to.

We returned and I went to shower. She would enter to the bathroom after me. We planned since yesterday about going to the Costco to buy the pills and medicine they didn't want to give my grandma in the hospital. It was then that I sat and played with Luis after wearing my new hoodie, or is it a parka?, I noticed how every time that they won me they were using the white chips. I swapped them and again won.

We played chess but they won the two times. After a couple of days ago that I watched the second movie of Star wars, that one that I have tried several times to finish but never got to, I remember the chess game that I had in the computer that used the characters as the pieces. It's fun playing with them. More than the challenge of knowing the most probable outcome is my loss or the thrill of actually believing I can really win that time, it's something else entirely. Even remembering of that old game of my past, a little part of me wishes to look for it on the internet and find myself a copy.

There is another memory of that movie. I was sitting in M's house, in the old room of her brother, we were sharing the couch and film was playing on the screen. Was it the computer or a dvd? Was it a blu ray? How many minutes actually past before we ignored it entirely? Does she think sometimes of those memories? What feelings would accompany them? What feelings do I experience thinking about that time myself?

Before going to Costco, My mother was upstairs with my grandma talking about something. Were they arguing? As I entered my mother said to me with the intention of introducing me to the subject of their conversation and with a face trying to share the absurdity of it: "She says the only medicine missing is the antidepressants and she won't take them". My grandma said that it wasn't that entirely but that she had some in her home and she would wait until arriving there. I told my mom to go to the Costco and buy everything. The pills didn't cost more than 20 pesos each box.

We left but she told me that first we must stop at the bank. I drove there and got down with her. Luis stayed in the car. At first I sat in the couch of the waiting area as my mother approached the window when the upper screen showed her number. A couple of minutes I noticed that they were still talking and then another person approached her. She told me to go with her and we passed with the manager. Supposedly she was going to open a savings account or something like that. Did he say something to imply my gender? My mother called me Sofia with him and there was no answer on his part. It wasn't until we moved to the other teller, that she welcomed me with a "miss".

When everything concluded then an hour later, she said bye with the same calling. In Costco we bought several things and the medicines for both my grandma and me. The car was ready and I drove the pick up to the mechanic where my father was waiting. Tomorrow I'll talk with Rene.

There are some videos right now about a trans woman who's been arrested and is being processed as a man.

Why am I watching this?



## 2016-12-22

I left today for my session with Rene. I know I had several dreams. Again they had something to do with school, with a class. Was I wearing a skirt in them? I remember the sensation of having to seat and be careful of the opening of my legs. It's so bizarre having experiences of what I should had experience as a child in my dreams. I recall as well, the image of myself having my hair tied in a high ponytail with a red colored hairband.

I woke up early at six, but didn't move. I let Nymeria get comfortable again over my legs and both of us returned to sleep. I had the alarm clock set for a quarter after seven. I fed her and let her do her business inside. At first I guided her outside but noticed that the floor was soaking wet, she just peed and I urged her to return. I ate a hot dog and swallowed my pills with a glass of tea.

The next alarm was set to a quarter before ten. I moved it around and ended up not using it. Were my mom and grandma up when I got out of bed? I think so. What did I wore today? I was planning to wear my Salamanca hoodie. I went to shower and wore the jeans-looking-leggings and an Ivan's undershirt. I barely shaved my face with my razor machine and came downstairs. My mother whistled at me as I entered my room. "Those legs" I heard her comment to my grandma. "I remember when she had those skinny little legs...". I went into my bedroom and tried to comb my hair with my fingers and put mousse.

I took the sweatshirt and put it on. I didn't like it. I looked weird and huge. The sleeves were short and the sweatshirt itself barely reached the waist of my trousers. I looked like a grown up wearing a garment from their childhood. It was fitting the thought of my trying to put on something symbolically from a past era of my life. I took it off after just a glance at the mirror and decided to wear the purple sweater. I didn't realize it until later, but everythin over my waist but the bra was masculine. Even my shoes were something I wore when I presented as Ivan. The only thing feminine in my attire were my underwear and the fitting trousers. I didn't even wore make up.

My mother was supposed to go out and meet with my godmother and Luis had plans too with his friends of going to the movies and seeing the Star Wars flick. Neither of them even took off their pajamas.

I left the house a couple of minutes after eleven. I stopped by the gas station. The dispatcher received me and served me. He didn't use any gendered words, except saying "servido" when all was set and done. Months ago, the first time that I heard that word Catherine killed my excitement when I told her I had been said that word but in feminine. "They always say it like that, they mean the gasoline is served".

I parked in the parking lot in front of Rene's office to avoid walking in the rain. I got into his floor and rang the bell. One of his patients came out with him some minutes later after I rediscovered the chess game in my phone. The session went normally. I guess I seemed happier and more energetic than other times. At least that was how I perceived myself. I returned to my car and paid the fare. The guy who was attending the booth wished me a good day and ended with a seÃ±o... I couldn't hear the rest. Was it a sir? A Misses? Did he stop himself?

It was then that I took notice of my appearance and clothes. I had no right to be upset. It was a direct consequence of my actions. Yesterday I turned 8 months on hormones. Two thirds of a year. Time is running so fast that it's disorienting.

I stop at Galerias plaza and entered Wal-mart. I bought two pairs of tights, two packets of dog treats and a nail clipper for the dog. That same clipper I had avoided before was the one that I miss-use and caused Nymeria's paw to soak in blood. I rushed her to the vet and paid the consult.

L sent me a message asking about tomorrow's session saying Lili had told her that she would not go anymore except the first days of next week. It ruined all of the plans I had set with her and my other patient. I tried to organize that situation at the same time that Nymeria bit off her bandages and I wrestled with her and struggle to take of the tape pasted to her hairy leg.

Tomorrow I'll see both of them and then, later in the afternoon I'll see Catherine. I'll give her MuÃ±eca's clothes and her gift. She has one for me. I had actually forgotten about that.

I love the feeling of being more excited about seeing her than knowing what she got for me.

## 2016-12-23

I already had around a hundred words in this fucking page. Just now, after returning from the tab of Facebook where Anahi is spamming my Timeline the window was not framed correctly. I refreshed the site and my whole progress just deleted. To think that just some time ago I was seeing the posts in Catherine's page and felt jealousy of them.

I closed the tab. Nymeria just farted and a fetid smell of shit knocked my face. A couple of minutes ago, maybe an hour, there were skid-marks on the floor and a similar smell became noticeable. A small piece of feces got caught in one of the chair's wheels and it was spread all around the floor.

In the last page before the refresh I was just narrating the dream Catherine had about both me and my ex. She had come to me for a talk, was she trying to make amends? I don't know. She asked or offered a hug after looking at Catherine in some sort of permission asking. "Meh, whatever", was the signal Catherine showed back. I put my arms around her neck. "No, not like that", she corrected me. "Is she being serious?", both Catherine and Anahi, who were standing nearby giving us some space and privacy, looked at each other in disbelief.

The dream ended some time around there. "Did I already look like a girl?", was the first question that came to my mind. Monica and I, while in our relationship, argued and separated countless of times. It didn't matter the reason or cause, after an e-mail or a call, we always made amends. It was a common issue with us that she was not able of ever putting boundaries. Wether it was with her last ex Rodrigo who kept threatening her with suicide, or Benny and the gang of lovers who kept asking her out on dates or almost harassing her, or her current boyfriend who, by then, was actually harassing her and following her around. They were all deleted once and then re-added again. They always came back. Even her first boyfriend who supposedly betrayed her friendship and saw another girl behind her back, he was the contact whom she asked me to give her stuff with.

Ivan is gone. He'll stay gone. Is it really even imaginable that Monica would care about me?

I saw both of my patients this morning. Lo sent me a text saying there was a problem with a tire of her car and she would be late to the session. I answered back there would be no problem. She came just 10 minutes after the set time. She didn't end the test until half an hour into the session of my next patient.

He brought the money, but just half of the part from last week.

I stopped by the tortilla shop to buy the stuff my mother asked me for on my way back. Then she sent me again for the stuff she didn't know was missing.

Catherine picked me up in the afternoon. We went to eat pizza at Playas and then saw the Star Wars movie.

My mom told me before leaving how my grandpa had called and said he wanted to meet us and say hi tomorrow, in the early morning by the airport. At first, I thought and went straight to the obvious question, but said nothing. She said it in a way of asking what I thought, as if it was just a possibility.

When I returned she mentioned it again as a matter of fact. I asked the question, to confirm what I worried.

"Does Carlos know about me?"

"No", I let the emotion show in my face. "When? At what time?", she said excusing herself. It's not her duty to tell anyone. I don't have contact with him. She is his daughter. Is he my grandfather, though? I can't even remember the last time I saw him. What's the point in showing myself and explaining to someone whom I won't see for another several years?

I had the feeling that somehow it was all my fault. It is my duty to tell the people. "It's not something to be said by the phone", my mom said. It's not something to explain at the airport, either. No matter how much I think about it. There is nothing I could had done.

In Playas I mentioned the elephant in my and Catherine's room. She whine about her job and I told her how she is still there because she wants to. She has the opportunity to leave but doesn't want to. She can come with me to the capital and do something she likes, but she prefers to stay here. She repeated herself. And the emotion came back. I think I ruined my night right then and there.

I resent her for having a high paying job, I resent her for being normal and not having to deal with the things I do. I resent her for not helping me when I need her.

Those are stupid reasons and not valid, how can I say them out loud, how can I tell her?

They are irrational, but they are.

I cried today. I don't feel like writing. Merry Christmas.

## 2016-12-26

I'm home again after the Christmas holidays. It's been three long days. The first one, two nights ago, before we even left. My mother woke me up around 6 in the morning opening the door of my room to tell me that Carlos had arrived earlier, he was already at the airport. "Do you want to go?" "No, not really". I told her truthfully. I'm not sure if it's regret what I'm feeling. It'd would be nice seeing a reaction, something. I don't think I want to tell him myself, though. They returned one or two hours later. Nymeria didn't want to eat. The food was still in her plate.

We got ready and made the baggage. We left around noon. There were gifts in the bag that lies on the roof of the car and the trunk was filled completely. We were in the 5&10 lane when Miguel told my mom how they had forgotten about the cakes. My father asked if we wanted to return.

Who was it? I think it was my mom who mentioned how my godmother had sent her a text message telling her that the Rumorosa was closed because of the snow.

I got distracted again seeing the pictures. It was from the beginning of my transition, the first appointment with the endocrinologist. I left around my trip to Guadalajara with my parents. No, the first picture I saw today was in the Universal Studios. Catherine will finally go there with her family in a couple of days. The 28th or 29th is supposed to be the get-around of the office. Catherine will be in Hollywood by then.

I got the flight ready for my departure in a just a little days more than a month. I have, have to scan and upload the documents and continue with the studying. I can't let more days go by. Tomorrow I'll work on the evaluations and scan the documents. I can't let more time pass...

We returned home to pick up the forgotten cakes. I remembered about Nymeria's certificate of vaccines in case we were to cross the border. As we, my mom and I, were to go out again, I saw the pill organizer in the table. I had forgotten it. It was good then that we returned.

We spent all of Christmas eve with my uncle. This time wasn't as fluid and alright as the one before. It was messy and awkward. Some slips of pronouns and several mentions of "Ivan". Everyone hurt a little more than the one before. Still, the night was enjoyable. Time passed and midnight came upon us. It was time to open the presents. It's not as exciting as when I was a child. It's not that I don't enjoy opening the boxes or the thrill of trying to figure out what the contents are. It's not a learned state of un-materialism. I am thankful of what my parents are going to do for me. They'll help me settle there and pay for the trip. Miguel got his iphone. The comments, not necessarily in bad faith, of "losing him" or disowning him because he now has apple products was painful to hear. I couldn't help but compare the sentiment with being different, with being like myself. I tried to ignore them. Even though I told my parents not to give me anything and just make the deposit, I opened various gifts. The ones I knew about like the shit pillow or the hot dog one, and the Harry Potter pajamas; some I theorized but weren't really sure, like the box of nail polishes. And some that were completely surprising, like the pajama set I'm wearing as of right now or the 3ds game that Luis gave me in a simple wrapping with the words: "you can keep the 3ds and take it with you to Mexico city".

I was tired, I wanted to go to bed. I cleaned my face and got my change of clothes ready when I heard a knocking on the door. I looked through the peephole and it was my other uncle and his family. They got in and greeted me normally. They stayed for a while. Karl's boyfriend came as well. She introduced me as Sofia. I extended my cheek and he approached it. Does he know about me? Can he tell?

I went to sleep as soon as they left and my uncle and aunt went upstairs.

The next day I got up and showered early. I was eager to put on the new outfit that I bought with my mother. The pants and blouse would hide the unflattering curves that made me so uncomfortable the day before and were really obvious with the gray dress.

After noon we went to my aunt's house, the place where Nymeria was born. It's awkward getting asked about her name. "You named her in a really weird way, right?". They called me just as much m'ija as they used m'ijo. They sometimes said Sofia and others mumbled Ivan. The first half of the day I let it happen and ignored it.

Teo introduced me to his girlfriend. "Do you know each other?" He questioned. I didn't answer trying to think and her looked a little troubled saying: "yeah, but, uh..." I didn't got what she meant until way later. We had met before indeed. She came to my house, she slept in my bed. I picked them up from the consulate. But I looked different. I dressed differently. I was different. That was what she meant.

Some time after in the afternoon, I think it was after hitting the piÃ±ata, we left to visit my uncle Alex. He invited us to his house with his wife. It was nice seeing them together. I haven't interacted much with his wife. I carried Nymeria without know what to do. Could we enter? Could I put her down on the floor? When I noticed neither of them made any mention of my clothes or appearance, those were the anxieties that troubled me. It was a relief when my uncle told my father they had a dog as well. No, it was my aunt that said it first. My uncle told us she was named Khalessi. That was a similar natured, but different relief.

It was when we returned again to my aunt's house that I felt it too much. I saw the sights, I heard the slips of tongue. Teo told Karla and her boyfriend about the dog, how caring they were to them "until they left and our happiness went away with him". I saw the face of the boyfriend, Louis I thinks he's called, and felt humiliated. My uncle Beto said bye and called me Ivan. My father had asked me to confirm the address of my uncle in the phone "Check it in the map, Ivan".

I felt tired, exhausted. I wanted to go home where I would not hear that name again. I wanted to sleep and cry. I asked my mom to leave. She said she'd wash some dishes and we could go. We didn't exit the house until around 45 minutes later. Even then my siblings and father waited with me outside for another 10.

In the car my grandma noticed there was something bothering me, but I hid with my earphones. I heard the music and cried silently looking out the window. Ivan was still in my ears. The doubts burned me inside. The insecurity, self-hate and fear.

When we finally got home, I changed into my sleep attire, set the bed with my earphones and covered my face with the pillow. I hugged Nymeria and cried until my eyes were dry and my mind went numb. Not much later I fell asleep.

Today we came home. I bought the ticket to the capital. It's bought, it's set. The date is finally set in stone. It hurts putting a different name, an old and forbidden one. Will there be any trouble in the airport when I show my id? I hope not. Will I hide in fear in male clothing?

My aunt and uncle are here in my living room. They came as they said they would in Christmas. In a couple of hours we'll cross the border to give a ride to my cousin to the airport. He'll take a flight to Portland to visit his long distance girlfriend. Just a couple of minutes ago I saw the message from Iris. In it she asks me where did I change my pesos to euros. And if there was an issue withdrawing money from the ATM if the account is in pesos. She, as well, will go and meet his long distance boyfriend next month. Some day of January I think.

Yesterday I bought the flight ticket to the capital. A one-way ticket to Mexico City.

Today I played the Christmas special of Sense8, but remembered that Catherine had mentioned it and told me to watch it together. I paused it and put The OA instead. I watched just a couple of minutes.

Not much later my father arrived with the pizzas and I stopped it. Then, a little after, my uncle came with his family.

I showered Nymeria today. I let her into the shower without clothes and with a bucket filled with hot water. I took off my pajama pants and washed her. She looks way whiter and cleaner now.

I haven't counted my money. I have more dollars than I thought I would. My father gave me the allowance of the week and I have the 500 pesos my mother gave me for Christmas. When I showered and put on one of the new blouses that I bought with her in Macy's I considered cleaning my nails and painting them with one of the new colors. Maybe tomorrow.

Tomorrow we will go to the bank to make the deposit. I wonder of how much will it be. I told my mom about going to the sex shop to buy my godmother the gift she told me about yesterday. No, the day before. We were in the house of my aunt Cruz when she asked me again. She had said that she had made a mention of giving a sex toy to her being playful and I asked her why she wouldn't. She considered it and then asked me if I could accompany her to pick one.

In Facebook I had seen a post about a course of psychometric tests being given by a psychologist who works in the Mental Health Hospital. It didn't show any syllabus or table contents. The price was just as mine but I lack half of the preparations of the facilitator. Today I saw the post again, except this time it had countless comments asking for information and how to sign in.

Now I don't really know if it will actually happen. Several people asked me for information but not a single one has said something about confirming their assistance.

Will I accompany my parents and aunt to the airport? Around an hour ago my father said he would go lie down and sleep a little. Before stepping the stairs he looked at me and asked if I would go with them. I looked at my mom with a face showing doubt. "I don't know", I told him... "Do you want to go?" "Sure".

I feel like going to the bathroom. These last few days I haven't gone normally. I feel bloated and fat.

Nymeria is bitting the border of the bed making scratching noises. I can't concentrate with the words. I'll do something.

I asked her to get up to my bed, but instead I used the dark red blanket to wrap her into. She is there now, calm.

She has her head out of the blanket just enough to continue bitting.

I used one of the pictures that my mother uploaded from Christmas as my new profile picture. I hear the noises of the notifications in Facebook telling me how there are some new, something, maybe comments, probably likes.

There are days when I looked at some pictures of mine or even my own reflection and I don't understand how anyone would ever gender me female. I see my face and can't blame my relatives or my father for keep using an outdated name. There are others, though, when I see that face, and specially that smile, and I get it. I get it why I did it. How I decided to get this way, to fight for what I want, for who I am.

How can I type my words and eat cheetos at the same time? Is it even possible?

This is the second night I've slept in my bed since Christmas. It wasn't this one that I dreamed with my ex. I had a wet dream with her the one before, I guess. There was something about the dentist and a parking lot of several levels and a body thrown and ignored. I can't remember the context of the encounter. I was with her, I recognized her face. I knew it was a dream and it wasn't real. I took advantage of it. Did I enjoy it? Was I a man in the dream?

It was only wet in the name. I reached an orgasm but there was nothing material that could serve as evidence. After the morning I well could had let the dream be forgotten and it would be as if it hadn't happened. Can't I say the same about our relationship? The only thing that remains are the memories. Could I let them go, it would be as if it never were.

Yesterday I finished the words while my uncle and aunt were outside in the living room. I did went with them. It was just my parents, my aunt and cousin and me. We left around one in the morning. My father did sleep a little. My mother and aunt just got into the bed but reached no slumber. Did I even try?

Time came and my mother opened my door. I took my purse and coat and went outside. My aunt was still in pajamas, she just changed and we all left.

The way to the border was dark and calm. We reached it in no time. The lines were short and quick. We stopped by the booth and a female patrol officer dispatched us. She reached for our cards and examined them. I got the same nervousness I feel when I wait for them to make a question or state a comment about my appearance. Nothing happened and nothing was said. She asked where would we be going and for what. My father told her the truth and we went on our way.

He stopped by a gas station and we saw a young man in just a short sleeved shirt. We were all wrapped in coats and scarves and gloves.

We got to the airport around 2 in the morning. The flight would depart by 6 and a half. Not even the checking in stations were open. We sat and wait. There were some people lying on the chairs sleeping and waiting. We talked. My mother kept making comments or references about the emotions my aunt would be experiencing. Eric was nervous and excited. But his emotions were unexpressed. It was, weird, being in there again. I hadn't returned to the airport since my trip to Europe, and then my return.

I left Mexico as a trans girl pretending to be a normal boy. I returned as Sofia disguised as Ivan, even to herself.

I didn't get to finish the review of the pictures. Around July the software keeps crashing. I saw the messages of my first days there. Even then, when months of being out publicly as me and being referred in the feminine by family, friends and strangers, there was certain warmth in the words of Catherine.

In the waiting area I was nostalgic. I kept returning to the thought that I'll be reliving soon the experience of leaving home for a long time. Of traveling to the unexplored and new and scary.

Eric checked in and we all waited outside the security area for him to pass. We returned home and arrived around six in the morning. The sun was barely showing in the horizon when we got in. I lied down with Nymeria and we both slept for the rest of the night. This morning they returned to Mexicali. I guess the same routine of Christmas will repeat this New year. We'll go celebrate the holiday with them, return a day later and receive them in our home the day after. This time we will pick him up. Instead of being dusk we'll receive him in the evening. And then, exactly a month later, my parents and siblings will say their good bye's to me.

Ivan left a long time ago. I'm going to Mexico to finally erase him. To move on, to live my life. To start it, finally.

Today my mother made the deposit to my account. I have money, some. I still don't feel ready.

## 2016-12-29

I'm ready to leave. I guess I should finish the words before asking for the ride. "Interpsique party" was written for yesterday in the agenda. When I transcripted the important dates to the notebook I got into it. The date was wrong. The party is today's Thursday instead of Wednesday. Catherine said she was not able to go because she'd be out of the city, so it was moved to today.

I am all changed and set. I showered in the morning to go see Rene. Nymeria didn't wake up by 7 anymore. The alarm sounded first and we stayed asleep. I postponed it several times, from 8 to 10. Again Nymeria hesitated before eating. I let her.

I talked normally with Rene. There were several things to mention like the trip to Mexicali this Christmas and the reactions of everybody. My crying in the living room after not being able to deal with the dysphoria. I talked a little about my family dynamics and the relationship with my father and his own relationships with his siblings. When I got out I heard the sound of paper bags but I was mistaken. There was no breakfast. I left the house around eleven fasting. I drank a glass of tea with my pills. My hormones and antidepressants were my meal for the day.

I feel more dysphoric than before. Even now with eyeshadow and lipstick and other make up, I took a picture to send to Catherine and I struggle with the image of him.

I dreamed with Monica.

Yesterda. There was something I did not write about. I had written when it happened. I used my mother's computer to pass the pictures. In it, I guessed I could use her facebook to send them to my uncle. When I opened it, instead of stumbling up on her picture as I told Rene, I looked for her. I opened her profile and lurk there in the latests news of her life. I saw her most recent pictures.

And I felt like shit.

The last one even had my mom's like with the fifty something other people. I mentioned to Rene how it was like some sort of treason. She's my ex, why would she like it. And on Monica's side, why hasn't she deleted her? She said she doesn't want to know nothing about me. Maybe that's why. She doesn't want to, so she doesn't look. She has the pictures but she doesn't look, she doesn't care.

Even months later I still am writing about her and I did look for her.

I had dreamed with her a couple of days ago and I dreamed of her again.

Catherine was in the dream, too, but I think I've forgotten her part and most of the context. We looked around in some kind of food place, she wanted to buy something to eat before school. We were in school, was it university or high school? Were there any uniforms? What was I wearing? How was I dressed?

In the market Catherine wandered around but ended up not buying anything because the clerk who handled the food admitted to have just farted.

It's seven pm, the hour Robertoni had posted in the message group that the meeting would start. I had said how tardiness was one of the things I couldn't deal with in people and yet I will be late.

I'll be going without Catherine. I asked her, but she said she was really tired. She preferred going out tomorrow with me. I know if I had left 20 minutes ago, I would had arrived on time, but probably I would had to enter alone.

Am I nervous about being carded? Have I been carded lately?

In the dream that was the last of Catherine. The next scene I was inside a classroom, just getting in and taking a seat. I had seen how Monica had taken or was just to take on besides or behind me. When I grabbed a seat for the missing spot, someone told me how she had moved. We had just talked in my dream. Was it some kind of memory or did we really chatted?

I remember seeing her and wondering if she was mad with me. I saw my phone and somehow I knew I didn't had there anymore. I had deleted her contact just as I did months ago. Was it reason enough to add her again and ask her what was going on? We were just talking moments ago. Maybe everything was left behind for a moment.

But it hasn't. We haven't talked. We won't.

I'll go to a party and drink.
