## 2017-01-01

Yesterday I forgot again to write the words. I was in the United States sitting in the couch watching a movie, was it midnight already or did I give up to the thought of cheating? If I was on the couch watching a movie it was probably after midnight.

The night was easy-going and nice. We leave the house around noon or a couple hours after. Was it that day that I had the argument with Catherine? No, that was Friday when she cancelled our plans. I guess I wrote about it that day. There's no point in repeating all of that again.

Yesterday we continued our silence. The last messages we exchanged the day before it was around 6 in the afternoon that she asked me something after I had just woken up. Nobody continued the conversation. If it had ended up on me, I don't think I would had sent her something on New Year's.

Outside in the dinning room my mother and grandma are talking about Mexicali, I guess something happened with my aunt. "You know when she changed? when I called "Sofia"", I heard my name and paused the music and paid attention. What was that about? They were talking about my aunt Luisa, I guess.

Thankfully it didn't get to that. Catherine sent me a message in the afternoon, asking if we were already in Mexicali. I answered her. The conversation didn't advance further. She told me how she felt ill. Food poisoning. Was that like a reason for her not wanting to go out?

Then it wasn't until new years, when we ate dinner and just as we were getting into our plates, a knock on the door called our attention to receive my uncle and aunt and cousins. Karla arrived later with her boyfriend. He's studying Medicine, does that mean he's more knowledgable about trans issues? Is that something good or bad? Do I want him to be supportive or just oblivious?

I met Edgar's girlfriend. Until now I had forgotten she's actually younger than me. He introduced me as his niece "Sofia". It was nice. She didn't hesitate nor made any face or comment. None of them called me Ivan. That name was mentioned but I can't remember by who. It doesn't really matter. There were some conflicting emotions. Catherine sent me the holiday message and then, some times later asked me if I was upset with her. I told her the truth.

What is it that I feel? I resent her for being successful. I resent her being tired about having a job and being busy and having things to do. I hate thinking how she has it "so much easier" having all her papers in order and a good paying job and yet she has the choice of staying here.

Tomorrow my uncle and aunt will come to Tijuana to pick my cousin from the airport. I am just remembering about how my mother said that if I would accompany her to pick a present for Norma it would have to be tomorrow. I asked her if she will want to go. She answered "yes".

Was it yesterday or today that Catherine and I talked about our silence? Would I really explain to her how I feel?

I told her, I am ashamed of those feelings. I hate myself for thinking that, for needing her help and resenting not having it. I understand it's not her obligation, why does it hurt me so much? Why am I so afraid?

We ate breakfast. There was an alarm that woke me in the early morning. I can't even estimate the time I fell asleep. I was so tired I took the first opportunity I could to go to the bathroom and change into my bed clothes and then set up the couch to lie down.

We visited my father's sisters. I'd be lying if I wrote here I wasn't nervous. We arrived and Martha was sitting in the porsche. I greeted her. A couple of minutes later, my other aunts arrived as well. Alma, Paty and my cousins Juan Carlos and Sebastian. Sebastian acted just like all the other children do. Juan Carlos was excited to see me and hugged me tightly. My aunt Paty said good bye, "mija".

They asked me some questions about the master and my next trip to the capital. I answer those questions with excitement and thrill. Both there and in the gathering of the office, I was told how they don't really like the city.

I know it's not the best, I know probably I won't love it.

It's not the traffic, nor the insecurity, nor the energetic way of living.

I am scared of being hated, and ending alone.

## 2017-01-02

I'm sitting in the back seat of the Mitsubishi next to my aunt. We are on the line of the border to cross to the United States. We are just to the side of the Premiere hotel.

My uncle and aunt arrived around four or five in the afternoon. I am taking my coat off. I feel ill. My stomach is delicate. I have some sort of nausea. Maybe it's the artificial heat of the car.

Catherine sent me a message in the morning. At first it was a screencap of her playing pokemon Go. She said she's been playing the app for half a year and just now encountered a squirtle but has no pokeballs.

I saw her text and felt irritated. I thought of all the times that we walked around the beach and I glanced at her phone to see the game on its screen.

"you know I love you, right?"

I remembered her question when I went to the bathroom.

"Do you want to do something tomorrow?", she asked before starting her shift.

"I don't know, let's talk about it later."

She answered a couple hours later: "but I'm asking you if you want to... Sorry... How much later?"

We talked about it in her break. I am irritated. I think about Friday and all of the emotions that have been ruminating since then. I want to cancel her just like she has. I want to not care about seeing her just as I feel she doesn't.

I asked her if we went out tomorrow, would we see each other for my birthday. She said it was part of her idea. Seeing each other tomorrow would be an opportunity to talk about what happened, and not leave it to that day.

I helped my mom with her PowerPoint presentation. She was working on it in the living room when making a mistake around two thousand blank slides were added.

We are still making the line. Catherine sent me a message asking who would go, and that we should leave my aunt because she doesn't have sentri.

"We can't just leave her, we're going to pick up her son"
"is he underage?"

I was frustrated with her inability to empathize. Yeah, he left less than a week. But she wants to see him.

I stopped the conversation again and questioned her once more about what she wanted to do tomorrow. She hasn't answered since that question two hours ago.

She saw Miguel, her friend, today. They are in Costco. She is just answering. We could go to Playas. Have I seen the episode of sense8? She saw it initiated in Netflix.

I think about answering and the same worry I shared with her. I am scared of being an asÃ­ hole towards her because of all the emotions I keep repressing.

I had told her how I thought about going to Balboa Park and eating at Å¥ guys for my birthday.

When I saw the pictures in my computer, around the beginning of the year when we left to other countries there was a going out that consisted in us going to San Diego downtown and eating there. Was it the first time we went?

I looked and was different right then.

Now it will be one of the last times I'll go to the United States again in a while. It'll be commemorating my first birthday as Sofia, oficially.

Sometimes I fantasize about the name on the cake. I've never been a fan of cakes and birthdays, and yet now I smile with the image of Sofia written with syrup on a dessert shared with family.

I was sweeping the floor when my dad came indoors with a bunch of papers. "are all of them for here?", asked him Miguel.

I didn't hear his answer but can't think of no reason why would he come with letters from other houses.

I was starting with the dinning room when he reached an envelope and said: "I think this is for you"

I grabbed it and looked at it. At first I thought it was something good from the bank of my new debit card. I don't know which I saw first, the image of the hospitals and the health theme or my name written.

It didn't fit. Who would send me a letter with my name? Who knows about it? I opened it and inside came a catalogue and two plastics with my name written as well. It's some kind of membership with a vigency of two years.

And here I am, leaving the north part of the country in one month exactly.



## 2017-01-03

Catherine and I agreed to meet up today. I worried that we would use the opportunity to talk about what has been happening lately, with both of us. Halfway in our date I lost that preoccupation. Just arriving to my home, we lasted about an hour talking, sharing and crying. I said how I've been thinking about breaking up, and then moments later actually feared that the conversation would really conclude there. I had a panic attack, sort off.

The status quo remains, for now. She confessed that the gathering they've been organizing was kind of a surprise for me. That's how the conversation started. Arriving to the neighborhood, I asked her if she really wanted to see them, to go. We stopped and she lowered the volume of the radio. And so it all began.

Yesterday I said good-bye to my uncle and aunt earlier. I went to my bed and lied down. I had done the words in the line to cross the border. Three hours we lasted. It wasn't as shorts as my parents hoped but neither as long as it could had been. We arrived just in time to the airport, even after the needed stop we had to do so my mom could go to the bathroom. I stepped down the car with my aunt and little after my mother followed us. I knew how to look. I searched for the flights on the carrousels of baggage. I found the airline in the screen above the last one and from there I scanned the faces of the people waiting. I think I saw him first. Moments later my aunt did as well. I was the one who took his suitcase. It was a little exciting and scary at the same time. Will I be doing that soon? Yes.

I am eating a bowl of soup and a flour taco of beans. The bowl is empty and there's maybe three bites left of the taco.

I'm going to the kitchen to heat the rest of the soup and another tortilla.

We stayed in the United states less time than the one it took to get there initially. Since the day before that we came back from Mexicali there was a nagging backache that was just gestating. At first it was an unpleasant sensation in my buttocks being seated on half of the seat of the car. Yesterday, maybe because of the cold or as a late manifestation of the lack of rest, it grew exponentially.

It got to the point that I went to bed early and then, an hour after, had to get up again suffocating on the pain and desperation looking for a cream or a pill or whatever that could take the pain away.

I rested and woke up fine. It was late in the morning, an hour shy of noon. We had agreed to meet around two in the afternoon, I had time to get ready. I did. Catherine ended up picking me up. I decided to wear make up, probably I won't tomorrow, even though I'll go to the municipal palace to ask for a new birth certificate. Should I go feminine? Should I tame it down to androgyny?

We went to the plaza in the Playas. I asked Catherine to wait in the car and she noticed something wrong. We window shopped around the plaza and then went to Argana. There was no sign of the waitress who knows us. In the market, the man before us asked me if I was waiting in line with the car next to me. I said no and he joked how he wondered if "the lady will get a chocolate overdose". The waitresses in Argana gendered us correctly the same way.

We watched the first half of the Sense8 christmas special. We bought a deck of cards in Dax and looked at the baggages.

We talked about this Friday, the day before my birthday. What will the plans be for then? We could go eat breakfast early in the morning and cross just after. Spend the morning in Balboa Park and finish eating at 5guys.

I remembered I have a session with a patient and sent him a message to see if I could move him. He hasn't answered back.

From Argana we went to Plaza Rio, we looked around for baggages still, we talked some more and even wandered around the toy are of Sears.

That's why she kept mentioning the gathering of the seven.

What will happen? Will she cancel it? Will we break up?

I'm accustomed to fear being now less than a month away of leaving. What is this that I'm feeling?

## 2017-01-04

"You write 700 words daily and can't redact a single letter?" "In exactly a month from now you'll be doing your exam"

I almost forgot the words again. Not even a week since I broke a 50 day long streak and I would fall again. Will I continue this habit when I leave the city?

Just now I told Jhonny about my departure. He sent me a text message, maybe it was early today, maybe it was from yesterday. "Let's go to six", he invites me. I told him the truth, I don't go to that place. It scares me. He thought I was being playful and insisted. I kept my ground and repeated myself. Just a couple of minutes ago I added this new bit of information he lacked: I don't have much time nor money. In a month I'll be going to the capital.

Yesterday that Catherine and I returned from our date, before we started talking about the ugly past and fearful future, we remembered to buy two agendas again. I want to. I liked having a way of recording the daily anecdotes and occasions. I have an attempt of one in the black book with the logo of the university. I was actually surprised that I really finished this one.

Just this evening I filled the last three days. A full year. What I can't do in this page I managed to in that beautiful notebook that Catherine and I bought a year ago together. Was it after watching The Danish Girl?

It surprises me how I dared to go outside dressed femininely even without starting hormones. I am full time. I live my life now. I am Sofia, inside and out, in my home and my job, with my friends and family and coworkers.

Why does it still feel like a far away wish? I have a prescription with my name in it and I asked Rene for his, as well.

I found really hard to get out bed today. Last night Rene sent me a message to confirm today's session at 1pm. We hadn't set a time for our session. I used the extra time for sleep. The backache returned but not with the same intensity. Several periods of sleep, the last ones, I spent them on my back with Nymeria lying on my arm. Neither of us got out until after eleven.

I dreamed with Alan. I dreamed I was in some sort of house. There was family in there, probably my grandma's home, but not really. I saw him. We talked. In the dream I asked him, no, told him Aidee had said how Monica talk about me behind my back to him.

"Yeah, I was angry with you. She made me be angry to you."

We talked, I don't remember if he told me what was exactly what were told. He looked different than how I remember him. No, the other way around. He was different than how I know he looks, he was more like how I remember him but older-looking.

When I woke up, I stayed with the doubt if Aidee had really told me that Monica poisoned my image to him. I wondered about it, trying to remember. As the day passed I let the thought go, just as I rethink it, I can see how it's not really possible. Aidee hadn't talked with anyone from the university. Monica isn't and wasn't really close to Alan. She might not be the innocent angel as I idolized her, but neither is she a harpy that hates me and wishes me ill.

I focused the rest of my thoughts to Alan. Should I reach out to him? I thought about sending him a message. Something along the lines of saying I recalled his birthday was a couple of days ago, but I was unsure of congratulating him. I don't really know how much he knows about me, or his opinion nor thoughts. It doesn't really matter. If he doesn't mind, good. If he dislikes me now, it's unfortunate but inconsequential. I dreamed about him, that my ex talked about me behind my back and it made me think. That I have no right to defend myself. I know, more like suspect, that they haven't had contact lately, and even if they did, I wouldn't be one their conversation topics.

I thought about our friendship, how he was there for me and we shared so much. I never thanked him. As the semesters pass, I let our friendship drift away. I preferred being closer to Mona and that other group of people, than being loyal to him. I don't talk anymore to neither of those people, some don't want to know nothing about me, and yet I preferred them to him.

I'm sorry and I wish him the best.

I just wanted him to know that I haven't forgotten him, and he's still in my mind.

## 2017-01-05

"Hey, Luis, or more correctly Leslie"...

I opened the blue notebook that was inside the bag I lend to them. I caught a glimpse of what was written inside before he took it from my hands. We started playing chess.

I set the alarm at the maximum I could sleep and having time to get ready and go meet my patient. Yesterday, was it? No, Tuesday I sent a message asking my patient to move our appointment to today. Yesterday, after he confirmed, I sent a message to Liliana telling her about the change and asking if the office would be occupied. She answered back just saying that please to move it to noon. Immediately I sent another message to my patient asking him about the change. There was no problem.

I had an extra hour in the morning and yet I got out of bed completely exhausted. Again the backache was still there, bugging, annoying.

"Katherine, kiss me" is the song that's playing as I return from my distraction and continue the words not even at its half. Rene was right. I write three quarters of a thousand words a day and yet, as I tried to redact the draft of the letter while my patient was answering I was in blank.

I showered and wore the first thing that I saw in my closet. It was the red sweater that looks kinda like a high school uniform as my mother told me. Under I wore the jeans looking stretch pants.

Just again as I went to the kitchen to heat some rice and beans, the pain in my back has returned. Tomorrow I'm supposed to get up early and get ready to go to the United States with Catherine. How am I supposed to do that with this handicap? I remember two years ago when we went to Guadalajara and just like this, I had this very same pain coming in the way to our trip.

I don't think I'll finish the report that I'm halfway done for. I should leave the hope of finishing the letter as well. Catherine set the time for picking me up by 8, so I should sleep as soon as possible. Maybe as soon as I finish this words and bowl of heated meal.

First we talked about going to Balboa Park, wandering around its passage and museums. Then, when thought about just going to the mall and shop around before eating. Then we returned to the plan just to cancel it again when there was predictions of rain. And now that apparently the rain won't come again until Saturday, the plan is back on track.

Just now I'm seating again after going upstairs to my parents room and get my visa and sentri card.

I saw a post in the group of the faculty that asked for girls interested in doing internship in a HR department. "Will the recruitment be done with the vaginas? Because I don't understand the need for the interns to be girls". I wrote that in the comment section knowing very well that I would not be able to send it. I took a picture and sent it to Catherine as not letting be forgotten what I thought.

She agreed that I should not post that. Instead I wrote in my Facebook something that I had thought about a long ago.

"Colleagues in HR, if you limit sex and age in your job description, you're not doing a profile, you're discriminating"

Passed a couple of minutes I thought it would go unnoticed, ignored and forgotten as time would pass. I was wrong. Kathia liked it first and then slowly the number reached like 8 or 9 people. That's enough for me.

It's something that has always frustrated me. I've experienced it myself. In seventh semester when we took the community psych class and we had to cooperate with a NGO that helped the community, the one we were assigned to, rejected us. Then we kept on the look to someone to offer our help, to give them a hand even without asking for pay. We couldn't find one. The teacher kept sending us offers and everyone turned unapproachable. Finally we were sent to the house of the Indigenous woman. Only to be greeted by saying that they were really expecting girls. The leader and head in charge didn't deny the entry to Felix or me, as I was presenting as guy still, but their actions showed her not wanting us.

I'm a recent graduate that can't really find a job. Looking for a master is just an excuse to stop the search.

I hope I get it and in the time I can change all my papers. I prefer a thousand times being rejected because of being a woman than because of being trans.

## 2017-01-06

Today is not really my birthday. Since the start of the day I had the idea that I would be celebrating it with Catherine. The plan was that she'd pick me up and we'd start the itinerary with a breakfast at pozolito before going to the United States.

I had to interrupt my writing to get up from my seat and run upstairs to the bathroom, I think this is the fourth time today that I've sat on the toilet with the intention to release my stomach uneasiness. My legs are throbbing in pain because of the walk. Right at this moment I'm feeling horrible with pain and discomfort. And yet, I remember most of this day with glee and satisfaction.

I woke up half an hour before six. Or was it a complete hour? I read Catherine's message from the end of night and wondered about getting up. It was way too early but would I have enough time to get ready? She had told me she'd pick me up at my house around 8 in the morning.

I did anticipate the alarm but ended up postponing it anyway. I got out of bed at six as it was the first plan. I showered and shaved and dressed and put on make up and got ready with extra time. She got here around eight ten. I saw the gift she had ready for me in the backseat before returning home to get my coat.

She drove to the University along the familiar drive I used to take almost daily some time ago that seems like an earlier life. Seeing the campus and the faculty again brought back all sorts of memories and emotions. Catherine proposed to go get two burritos from the place next to the bookshop. We could buy them and take them with us to The United States in our journey. We finally got to the plaza and specifically the mexican restaurant we discovered in our last semesters and fully enjoyed various times and occasions.

She parked the car giving its back to the locale. I mentioned her how my mom asks my dad to park in certain ways to avoid the sun to directly hit her seat. She asked me to grab the gift from the seat and she took some balloons and party hats from the trunk. I saw them with disbelief. Was she being serious? Did she really expect us to wore those and me to be there with that bunch of balloons?

I hesitantly walked with her. We sat at the table straight to the entrance door. I saw the silhouette of two women but paid them no attention. Subconsciously I thought how one of them resembled Anahi. And then it hit me when they stood up. The mysterious woman was Anahi, the other one was Paola. Catherine had mentioned a surprise gathering. We had all agreed to meet this Sunday so I had forgotten all about that. It hit me totally by surprise. I saw the tables and the number of chairs and still thought it would be just the four of us.

Catherine told me then that Chevo and Jessica were on their way.

We all had breakfast together and chatted and had a nice time. Paola brought some Kings' bread and we cut it as if it were a cake. They sang me the Happy Birthday song and in my good mood I misheard them gendering me correctly. They did say my name, though, that was enough to make me smile stupidly for the pictures.

We all said our good-byes, took some more pictures and then left. Catherine and I went straight to the border and we crossed it. I made the first stop in the bathroom in those offices.

We went directly to Downtown and took the bus to arrive to Balboa Park. We watched the dogs and saw some museum and walked around the botany garden and Alcazar garden and one with statues. We took lots and lots of pictures and had so much fun I forgot lots of times about the next trip and my dysphoria and my fears.

We ate at 5 Guys and I made the second bathroom stop. The burger tasted like glory and we talked some about our pasts birthdays. We made a stop at Horton Plaza where we wandered a little and she bought some tennis shoes. From there it was all a trip home.

Tomorrow maybe I won't see her. This time is turn to celebrate my official first birthday with my family.

## 2017-01-07

"24th, shouldn't it be 1?"

I didn't understand her at first. One? Why one. What could one mean? My first year as Sofia. Last year I already knew. So did she. Maybe it was because of that. I loved the pictures. I can totally notice the difference between past birthdays and my forced smiles. I was actually excited blowing the candles and seeing the sparks from the little thingy.

This is really my birthday.

Shrek is playing in the living room. We're all sitting together watching it. Both of my parents and my brothers and even grandma. The movie was playing in Dish but it was only in english. I was the one with the idea of searching for it in Netflix. And that's why and how we are all here.

Last night I finished the words and went straight to bed. Every word left was excruciating. I finished and as soon as I set the folder that I shared with them I hid under the covers as if being in my bed would do something about the pain. It didn't. I tried moving the legs and leaving them still. The pain was still there growing. It was excruciating and unforgiving.

Time passed. I knew the pain would fade away as I slept but reaching sleep was impossible with the pain. I really don't know the time I actually fell asleep but it probably wasn't earlier than two in the morning. I put on long socks and then changed my t-shirt to something more warm and finally I put the bottom of my pants inside the socks.

I can't remember what I dreamed. I know it was a lot. I didn't get up from the bed until after noon. Some minutes after one.

I went out of my room. I was really tired but the pain was gone. The first one to congratulate me was Luis. He extended his arms to hug me. Then my grandma remembered after giving me my plate and hugged me strongly. All of them hugged me and wished me the best. Miguel and my father, even. He extended his hand but I ignored it and hugged him instead. He didn't use any name.

I opened facebook not knowing what to expect. I knew there would be some people congratulating me. I know there won't be all of them, I don't expect either the number to be big.

Yesterday I celebrated with both my girlfriend and closest friends.

When I saw Jessica's post with the pictures and the video of them singing the Birthday song and stumbling with the gendered letter made me insecure. I checked some of the pictures and looked at all of the masculine features that betray me. I shared it with Catherine and told her how I did not really wanted to see the pictures of us. I knew I had liked some of them and seeing them with those eyes would really hurt me.

Today there were some pictures, too. I wore the blouse I put on Christmas but skipped the black cardigan that hide the uncovered shoulders. I liked most of the pictures. I told my parents to go to Hornero, that place I had visited with Catherine.

My father left in the morning to put gasoline in the other side of the border because of all that's been going one with the prize of the gasoline and the manifestations and the scarce because of them.

The movie is finished and everyone is standing up and getting ready. All going to continue their life.

We ordered pizza and spaghetti and salad. The pizzas were of chicken and chipotle and the other mexican. The spaghetti was with italian sausage and the salads were caesar's and cilantro.

Someone from the other table helped taking a picture from us. The food was amazing and the time we spent as well. We stopped by the bakery to buy a cake. We got here after maybe an hour from all the stops and waiting. I exchanged messages with Catherine after eating the cake and taking some pictures. Here they sang the tune correctly. The sparkling candle was sprinkling and there was a silence that broke with my grandma's singing.

Nymeria was nimbling something and my mother asked me to see. We're watching now the movie "Eight basque last names", with my mom and grandma after finishing Shrek. It's nice remembering the accents and those familiar voices as when I was there.

Johanna sent me a message saying how I looked really happy and Consuela was the first one to congratulate me on Facebook.

## 2017-01-08

I almost forgot to do the words again. I came back from the restroom after feeling an urgent need of going to the restroom. Luis was in the restroom we usually occupy so I went straight to my parents'. My mother is downstairs doing something on her tablet. I had just went outside to see the last episode of Sherlock as some kind of rest from redacting the evaluation report. I just need to finish the conclusion and print it. If I had finished it, I guess I would had come to bed instead to rest. I had totally forgot about the words.

Yesterday was my birthday. It's a little sad. I remember half a year ago when I came out publicly on Facebook and didn't care about the number of people that added me as a gesture of acceptance. Now I do think about the ones that I can recall not wishing me a happy birthday. I see Omar's and Diana's updates and think how they are way closer to my ex. I guess, because I don't really see what she does or publishes.

I told Catherine how I had thought about sending something to M's father. He was the first person I knew that shared a birthday with me. It was fun to have a mutual congratulations. I wrote a simple but heartfelt note lying to him saying that I had no ill feelings towards her daughter. Why do I really want to contact him? What is the real reason I had the urge of him knowing or facing my transition? Catherine is right mentioning how it would be the same feeling I have when knowing that my mom is still in some sort connected to my ex. I have no reason to communicate with him after the breaking of contact with M.

I type her initial as some sort of euphemism of her name. Why am I avoiding it? Do I expect me to eventually forget it?

I woke up late but not as late as other days before. Nymeria was by my side in bed. I can't recall if I dreamed or if it were a dark boring night. This time there were no pain or ill-thoughts that bothered my sleep. It was a clean dive to the sea of slumber.

How many days have I written in english since the first time that I had the idea of using this second language as a way of avoiding censure and over-thought and to use this habit as a way of strengthening my english fluency? Is it a year? More?

A year from yesterday I went out with Catherine in a rainy morning to eat breakfast before my session with Rene. It was one of the first times that I went out in a feminine attire. My lips were red and I think I wore these pants. My sweater was for men but I felt exposed. I see the pictures and see so much difference and yet I still think other times that I haven't changed at all.

She gave me a dvd of Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. The wrapping of the box was of newspaper, specifically the ads section. I noticed my name was in one of them and I point towards it in the picture she took. In the video that the camera records appears how I notice a second box that advertises a transexual prostitute. It was a weird king of laugh. Catherine was mortified and her apologizing shame made it alright.

We went to a motel, a fancy one, where we took our clothes off and enjoyed our bodies. It was after feeling feminine even without clothes, after freeing both loved and free, that I found the courage to call again to the endocrinologist and set the appointment stating my intention of starting medical transition. Three and a half months later I took my first dose and a year from that first day was sitting with my family behind me wearing nothing but female clothes and hearing them singing the birthday song with my real name.

I set the appointment to deliver the results of the evaluation for tomorrow afternoon. Again I kept postponing the scanning and writing of the letter. I asked my mom to go to Costco to buy the pills. The didn't have them. I asked my dad to stop at the other pharmacy near home, but instead of paying 20 or 30 pesos for every box, it was 87, 200 and 300 instead.

My mom gave me a bill of 500 to pay for them and even then I felt the cost hit my wallet. I have more money than ever.

I posted again the ad for the course that I would give this saturday. There is still 5 days left before its beginning for people to inscribe. Will I actually give it? Will a single person pay me?

Sometimes no matter how useful or skillful I think I am, I can't help to feel like a useless and dependent person incapable of sustaining myself.

## 2017-01-09

I'm home. As I opened the door Nymeria ran from the door of my room to receive me at the entrance with hops of thrill and enjoyment in her eyes. I see her now as she's wandering around my seat. I can't help but think about the last day before my departure. How will she take it? Will she know? How will I?

Yesterday was when we had planned to gather to cut a King's bread like the day before of my birthday. Paola cancelled at the last minute. Catherine and I had decided to skip yesterday and just go today instead. I went but she did not.

There was some issues with my patient and the delivery of her results. I was annoyed by Lili's attitude towards it, saying it was a must that the three of us were together. I can't see other reason than it being because of the money. It all was set to this morning. We agreed to meet at noon today. It wasn't as late as her appointment with Lili but it was early enough to agree with her schedule of work. I finished the evaluation last night after returning from deciding against seeing the latest episode of Sherlock.

This morning I received a call. That arabic song surprises me every time that it plays. It was her. It would be hard for her to attend today's session. Because of the rain they took her car and it was ugly where she lives because there isn't any pavement. Apparently it was raining. I hadn't realized. I told her it was alright. As soon as we hung up, I sent a message to Lili. We agreed for tomorrow at noon. Everything was set. I went back to sleep and didn't get up until two hours after noon.

I know I dreamed something. I have this sense of an alternate reality. A sort of return from a different scenery and experience. I can't recall what it was about.

My grandma prepared breakfast as if it wear a lunch and I ate it besides Miguel. A little after, in fact as soon as we finished, she sat at the empty table and finished her meal.

Today was set for going to drink a cup of something and see a movie. Maybe passengers with Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, maybe the reencarnation, some sort of scary movie, or maybe something else. I sat at my desk with the intention of writing and finishing the motive letter. I did start it and I did advance, but I did not finish. I made a draft but discarded it. I hesitated without knowing if I should write my name in there or made a mention of me being transgender.

When I told Catherine she found it hard to see why would I put it in. What does it have to do my gender identity with my intentions of studying a master in neurobiology. It's more about introducing myself. The motives letter is the first way of letting them know about me. How can I present myself without letting them know the most important thing about my identity? How can I put another name that not represents me?

I let it pass and just wrote.

I have maybe half, maybe just the introduction. I decided against just listing my experiences and what I've done. Maybe tomorrow that Catherine comes with me, and before picking up Luis for the movie I could finish it.

In a moment when I needed a rest from thinking about the letter I entered again into the site of rents and looking for roommates. It was stressing and like a slap to the face about the imminent reality I'm about to step into.

I agreed to go see them but told myself I would probably not enter to the movie and just spend some time with them until the movie would begin. I drove there using some of the last eight of gas in the tank. When I arrived Paola and Chevo told me they were thinking about going to Carrousel Plaza instead, the movie would being in 20 minutes.

At first it was a little upsetting realizing that my trip would end up being for naught. They asked me why didn't I want to go. There was a promotion and Paola would drive me from there and back. I thought how I told Catherine: "If I don't go today, I don't know when I will see them next"

I agreed.

## 2017-01-11

I cheated yesterday. Why?

What was I doing or what kept me busy? I saw Catherine yesterday. That's right.

Firstly I woke up and got ready to see my patient at noon. I wore... It wasn't really feminine but it wasn't male clothes either. I wore the dark red hoodie. Did It rain? I took a uber ride to the office. I got there first before Lili and my patient. I took the laptop with me. I had the intention of finishing redacting the motive letter. The office was closed so instead I waited outside with my phone and the internet. My patient arrived and we chatted for a while. I asked her if she entered to classes yet. I knew she was studying two careers. I waited for her answer explaining me that she had already finished in UABC and then I clarified that I was talking about Law.

We talked a little about how it has been and she mentioned an issue with her professor. That talk led us to the issues there are even with psych professors. I let it pass and just heard what she had to say. It got to a point that I could not resist. "Who?" I asked non-chalantly.

"Vinicio"

Liliana arrived a couple of minutes after noon and said how she has to work with her lack of punctuality. We sat and the session began. I gave and explained the results and my findings. I concluded and gave the paper to Lili to sign it. It was alright. They congratulated me again for my job. She told me how even before beginning Lili said only good things about my work. The hour passed really fast. We both would wait. The patient for her session with Lili two hours later and I for Catherine to arrive.

Lili asked me if she would see me later. I told her that probably not. I would just wait "for my uber"... "Catherine?" she understood my joke and laughed. She entered with her patient and I sat in the waiting room with the macbook on my lap and continued redacting the letter. Not much later Catherine sent me a message saying how she was around the corner. I put my things in the bag and went downstairs.

In her car she drove us to Plaza Rio. We would not eat yet. We instead sat in Dinasty12, order two cups of tea and started browsing the hotels for our stay in Mexico.

An hour and a half later we went to Luis school to pick him up. We arrived and there were two people standing in the door of the building next to the one that used to be the kindergarten where I went. Now it is the middle school that L attends. I stepped down the car when I saw the principal step outside with them. I saw their mouths move as if she gave notice of something. When I approached them to ask if the kids were still in there, they told me that they had already called my sibling.

Had they known I would pick him up? Do they know me? They know L situation and that means they probably know about their trans sibling, which I am.

We went to Plaza Rio. They ordered Ramen and I, a Lebanese hot dog. We sat the Assassin's Creed movie in 4d. It was really fun, all of us enjoyed it. She drove us home, but did not stay as we had talked about.

When I got into my desk, instead of keeping looking for hotels I told her I should instead be browsing apartments. And then I realized I had to finish the letter. Signing it was way harder than I thought. Putting my legal name felt fake and the real one felt imposing.

I finished and went straight to bed.

No. I'm lying. When I got home I asked my parents if they knew of any open gas stations. As Catherine brought us, we were on the lookout for the closest stations. She kept the lookout on her way home. My parent told me that the nearest one beside the London Bridge, the one we could not see because of the underpass, was open. "And there isn' any line, either". I grabbed my keys and went. It was closed. Instead I kept looking until I found one that was just opening. I paid 400 pesos of gas.

Today I had a session. I had forgotten about it. Miguel had asked me if I could take him to school. I told him I had no gas, but since I put some yesterday I took him today in the morning. From there I returned to get ready and leave for my second to last therapy. Or is there another one?

The lady from the dental office started talking to me, saying I couldn't be there. It was private and they paid for using them. I didn't understand her at first but she was just talking. Suddenly I just said. "I didn't park there" "Who did, then?" "I don't know... I came walking". She just apologized and left. After my session I went to Catherine's. We kept looking for hotels and I uploaded the documents I scanned in the morning.

The reservation is done and my application is set.

We watched together Sausage Party in her bed. We touched each other under her cover. After the movie she gave me the second part of her gift. It was a Wreck this Journal like the one I gave her before our departure and a photo album with pictures of my first year as Sofia. I wanted to hug her and kiss her all over, again and again.

I don't know how much I'll miss her. Neither the album nor the thousands pictures I have will help me with her absence.

## 2017-01-12

Thursday now is ending. Another week almost passes. This next Monday will be the start of the second half of the month. Exactly three weeks are left until my departure. The day after tomorrow was supposed to be the day of my workshop. It has sense, thinking about it now, that nobody gave me money for it. People who don't know me are not really probable to just deposit money to a stranger without even an address of office. I decided against collaborating with Lili because of a possible lose of money. I would had given her half of my earnings, I figured. But what I didn't realize was that I would be gaining a source of trust, a contact who could propagate the information to countless patients students of psychology. I could back myself up with the name of the office. Even losing half of the earnings, had she given me just one or two patients, I would be having more than nothing.

Tomorrow I have to talk with Paola. What are we going to do? She reserved the place. 200 pesos had to be paid as deposit. Will I give her the course? Will I pay her?

It's uncomfortable just thinking about her. I confessed to Catherine how I came to feeling that organizing it was a bad idea. Now I just feel worse about my situation. Not only am I unhirable, apparently I'm unable to even get clients myself.

It was all Paola's idea, she pressured me to do it, convinced me. Even after the first time that I had to cancel the improvised one, that would had been augure enough.

I had to interrupt my writing because of Nymeria. She was just here doing her usual troubles nibbling the box spring under my mattress when I held her down and reprimanded her. Without intention I ran over her paw with the wheel of the office chair. A sharp cry of pain came from her. She ran away. She was clean. When she returned from outside the room I noticed red spots. She had climbed the bed. At first I thought it was like when I tried cutting her nails. I might had injured her with the chair, maybe the blood came afterwards instead of instantly. I took her down of the bed before it looked like a crime scene. Her paws were clean. The blood was on her head and both ears, and spots were on her back as well, marking the white robe my grandma put on her. I went to the kitchen and wet a kitchen towel to clean her up.

Moments ago I went to the bathroom and after exiting, instead of returning I went to L's room to play videogames. My grandma shortly after came to the room as well to lie down. We heard her scream. "Somebody must have stepped on her", I disregarded it. When I saw the blood I thought of that. Maybe the injury was from there. I ran upstairs to ask Miguel or my grandma. Miguel was in the bathroom. While I was upstairs she cried again. It was a cry of pain, like a stab or a bite. I ran down. Maybe she did it to herself again with something. She was just waiting before the fence.

I kept cleaning her but nothing appeared. She's clean now, lying on her bed. I don't really now what happened. Probably she cut her ear with one of the springs from the bed.

Tomorrow I'll see my patient. I should go to order my birth certificates. Not tomorrow, but soon. Maybe next week. Will I have problems with that? Should I try to go as neutral as possible? I don't know how much it will cost me.

The reservation of the hotel is set and ready. Now it's just matter of paying Catherine. I could exchange half of the 4k pesos my mom gave me and use the other half to pay her. The trip is paid as well. All is set until our departure. Three weeks. Three weekends. 21 nights in my bed, with Nymeria, with my family, with a home.

I'll see Rene probably two or three more times. I'll see once my patient before giving him the results. Next monday was set the meeting with the psychologist who leaders the Association of Trans care.

In her email she talked about empowering trans women with a workshop or something like that. Catherine was the one who mentioned the absence of trans men. The only other trans person I've known personally is a trans man. I have read about and understand the evidence behind negating the idea that there are more trans women than men.

Is it as uncomfortable the exclusion now that I am in?



## 2017-01-13

I saw my patient today. I thought it would be the last session of tests applications, but I was wrong. I will see him again before the last one.

Yesterday, had I finished my words already? I think I put in the last section how Nymeria was bathed in blood. I reprimanded her and accidentally ran over her paw. Later, when she returned she had her head all spotted in red dots of blood. I was scared. I still don't really know how it happened.

I went upstairs to call Miguel, maybe he had seen something. My grandma came downstairs to see what happened. Miguel was in the bathroom but as soon as he got out he came as well. Even my mother, an hour later that the both of us were already in bed, opened the door and asked me.

I heard through the door how my grandma told her the story. My mother ended up believing that I ran over her ear instead of her paw. I was angry because of that suspicion. Maybe it's because I'm not really convinced that didn't happen.

At night, when it was time to go to bed, she was agitated and conscious about her surroundings. She was extra aware, as if she felt in danger. I looked at her and it scared me. She couldn't stay in one place. At first she would walk to the corner of the door and looked around as if she heard or saw something. Then she would walk to the other part of the room, next to my desk where all of her toys are. I went to bed thinking that eventually she would follow me and climb to my side. I was wrong. Time passed and she stay there, or swapped places between the two extremes of the room. I would turn the light on as minutes pass to check on her and she would keep looking around waiting for something.

I grabbed her and took her to bed with me. She was panting and breathing so fast. Her ear was still moist with the red liquid. I held her close to my chest trying to calm her down. She would for a while but then her respiration would accelerate to that frightening state. Minutes turned to hours. It was around two in the morning and she was still doing it. I had her under the sheets by my side, it was cold. I was cold.

I don't know the exact time either of us fell asleep. Maybe I dreamed something but I would not really remember. I have snaps of other dreams, fragments of lives and worlds that are not these.

I had my alarm at eight and nine. Today I would meet Lucas in the office at noon. I heard the voice of my grandma and my mother before her departure to work. She doesn't take L anymore. Grandma made her breakfast, it was on the table. I heard how she said that she prepared eggs for me. I didn't get up. Was Nymeria asleep?

The alarm sounded and I turned it off. I had an hour left for sleep. Then the alarm sounded again. I got out of bed and ate. The eggs were in the pan covered by a white plate. There was another pan with beans in it. I took two tortillas from the fridge and heated them. Did I make myself a taco or did I use the tortilla as a spoon?

I swallowed my pills with the leftover juice in the blue jar. I've been gaining weight. It doesn't matter how much I think about controlling what I eat, I can't seem to stop.

I showered and got ready. Miguel didn't get out of his room until the afternoon. I got to the office and it was open. I waited my patient, he was a couple of minutes late. The test was halfway done when I told him he could leave.

I took the wrong exit to my home. I had to return and do almost the double of the normal trip.

I sent a message to Paola asking her if I would have to return her the deposit of the hall or maybe I could go and give her the material. I had just told Catherine how I dreaded that conversation.

Apparently she didn't even booked it. She wanted to wait until the first client.

It's cancelled, I guess...

Lili didn't mention anything about going out. I didn't either. Tomorrow we might go to the united States. I wish. Even if we don't, I'll go with Catherine this Sunday.

## 2017-01-14

I knew today we would go to the United States. Yesterday my dad confirmed it when my grandma and L arrived from school. I set the alarm to get up early in the morning. Because of not having a sentri card anymore, we would all be having to do the normal line. So before sleeping I set the alarm to eight and a half and nine.

I can't remember if I dreamed something. I feel like I did. Something about my cousins or being in Mexicali. I don't really now. Nymeria declined sleeping with me in the bed. It was a lonely night. I didn't get up from the first alarm. I don't know if it was then that I heard the sound of my father in the living room. At nine, the second alarm, I did get up. My father was changed and ready watching television. I asked if somebody was in the bathroom and he answered instinctively. Miguel was showering. Luis was still in bed under his covers and my grandma was in her bed as well but awake. I came downstairs again to wait. Father was watching the daily show recorded from yesterday. As I stepped out from my room he paused it and rewinded it so I could hear the joke he was laughing about.

I went upstairs half of the way several times to check the status on the bathroom. Finally when I went upstairs Miguel was out of the bathroom but it was still busy. Now my mother was the one who was giving it use. I had to wait again a couple of minutes. My clothes stayed on the stairs with the towel over them.

Finally I showered and got ready. I shaved my chest knowingly that I would be wearing a long necked purple blouse. I tamed my hair and even wore make up. When I came down Luis was eating scrambled eggs at the table. Since he was eating I thought I could eat something as well and skip the breakfast stop. I acceded when my grandma offered me a taco of chorizo and eggs. "Just one, of corn". It was ready before I was.

My mother ate as well, we left the house around an hour before noon. I had given my mom my visa.

We crossed the border by Otay's crossing. It was short indeed. There wasn't more than 40 cars ahead of us. Mostly we lasted maybe a half an hour.

The border officer reviewed the cards, he passed my parents and stayed on mine after passing my brother's. I noticed and just raised my hand shyly. Probably she know what was happening. I had make up on and a subtle, but still noticeable red tint on my lips. She asked my mother's name and then my father and just made some jokes about where would we be going and the shopping.

We went to a money exchange booth. I went with my dad. There was a long line to the 8 windows. Just getting in, in front of the entrance was a sign stating that windows 9 and 10 were express for cash only and less than a thousand dollars. He stepped in and made the exchange. When we went out, the young woman who would use it, asked my father if he was going there, he said no. "Because there is a line"... "But they're express..." "The line is for all the windows".

He said nothing and we just left. I felt awkward for a long time and my dad really didn't seem to care.

We stopped in the mail to get my packages. I have the razorblades, my cable and adapters, the earphones and the pill container keychains.

We went to Las Americas first to buy my shoes. I didn't find the japanese ones I wanted, nor any shoe in Adidas. I bought a pair in Nike. Funnily it costed 75 dollars, just as I had told Catherine.

We bought some clothes in Old Navy, mostly me and my mom. L bought a hoodie just like my mom's.

From there we ate at 5 Guys. The postcard that I posted was still there. The one Catherine put with both of our names wasn't.

We went to Target, I bought a set of baggages. I looked at the agendas but could not find anything. What else did I buy?

In the first shop in Las Americas, as I was browsing, I noted the shop owner talking to my parents. As I went closer he said "and the young man..." I looked at him directly and he corrected himself " or... miss".

The cashier and 5Guys, after taking my order, addressed me as ma'am.

The lady in Old Navy, after asking for a fitting room, gave me the closest one to her and didn't gender me.

Catherine told me that is this weekend when his father is in Las Vegas. We cancelled our going out tomorrow. Maybe Tuesday we'll go to the United States or see Sherlock.



## 2017-01-15

I'm lying down on the couch writing the words in my phone. Nymeria is lying on my crotch and stomach, biting and nibbling her green rope toy.

I dreamed something this morning. This time I do remember. Again instead of having my current girlfriend in there sharing this fantastic reality of foreign circumstances, I had the visit of the phantom of a past relationship.

Nymi went down and ran away. I already closed the door because she had the marvelous idea of bitting her mat of pee.

Another of her latest activities is taking the rug from the edge of the first step of stairs.

In my dream I was in a home somewhere. This time it wasn't Mexicali. It was our house but it seemed different. It had this kind of "new" atmosphere. There were various animals, too. Nymeria, another dog and Pucca, the black cat of my uncle.

Was it some kind of reunion? I felt bad. Depressed. I wasn't in the mood for talking or relating to others. For some reason M was in there. We were nothing. Was it weird that she were there? How did others treat her?

She asked me if I wanted to talk or go somewhere. I, somehow, agreed. I don't remember the trip to our destination. It was some restaurant. In the table we're sitting three people, she, I, and her current boyfriend. Was he in the house as well?

The waitress came to take our order. I asked for just a glass of water. For some reason M stood up and went somewhere. Her boyfriend went behind her and I called for him, except I couldn't remember his name. Finally "Luis" flew from my mouth and he caught it. I extended the keys of my car and told him. "this was a bad idea, take her home, use my car"

I went outside and met some stranger that was smoking.

"Could I take one of those?"

He agreed to share one.

I smoked, waiting for her to come out and asked me what the Fuck was my problem, if I smoke now, why would agree to go out I would just bail, how would I return home?

I started smoking.

There was no sign of either of them. I kept smoking, relaxing. Paolas and Chevica arrived instead.

Through my mind passed the thought that there couldn't be a fittest moment for real friendship to come and give support.

Somehow an old teacher came and recognized the group. I can still kind of see her but I don't know who she is nor where I met her.

In the dream she recognized all but me. I confronted the situation and told her playfully. "I've changed a little since the last time we met... Can you notice the changes?"

I don't remember anything more.

I came out of my room to eat when my father arrived with the breakfast. One biscuit and two tacos.

I continued watching the A series of unfortunate events. Miguel has been talking to me more lately. Is he trying to be closer?

Right now nymi has gotten down again to go to him waiting for him to drop something or give her food.

He caresses her. He likes her more now.

In the television is the Harold and Kumar movie. The one where they get caught over a misunderstanding and sent to GuantÃ¡namo Bay.

I remember the first time I caught this on the television. Was I living here or in the other house in Otay?

I felt really uncomfortable in the scene where one of the protagonists masturbates and his shot of cum splashes his face.

Then, in the prison they're forced to suck a soldier's dick. Again it was unsettling.

Finally when they escape and get to a party in Miami where all of the girls are bottomless I changed the channel.

Tomorrow I'll meet with the psychologist that Melissa gave my contact information to. They and Anna, her friend, and another colleague.

We'll meet in a coffee shop in River Plaza. I could wear one for the blouses that I bought yesterday.

A couple of moments ago I painted my nails. Three of them already know I'm trans. Two of them have known me mostly as a man. Why would I care to show myself feminine?

I tried repairing the ipod nano. I disassembled it and looked for the missing "nipple" as one of the videos called it.

I ruined it. When I took the screen of, I ruptures the cable. Finally, after trying to paste countless things to the switch, I broke it.

I didn't used it, anyway. It's not a big lose.





## 2017-01-16

I'm home. I feel as if I hadn't done yesterday's words. The little boxes are checked all until today's. I haven't missed. Supposedly tomorrow I'll cross the border with Catherine. Either today or yesterday she went to Ross and bought three blouses really cheap. She showed me the images through Whatsapp. I told her that I wanted to go, too. "Today I browse the blouses, with you I'll browse the dresses."

We haven't set the details, but I don't worry much about cancellation.

These are just the only plans I have of the week. Today's, tomorrow and Friday's. Oh, right, Thursday's, too. I should go to the Municipal Palace to do the process of the birth certificates. I really don't know the time it will take to get them, nor the obstacles I might go through.

Even now as I'm typing, I know what I'm going to write about, but I feel like getting distracted. I have this urge to pause the typing and get up from my chair, go to the kitchen and see what they are talking about, what are they thinking?

Miguel is sitting on the couch watching the last episode of Sherlock. I haven't watched any but the first one. I told Catherine I wanted to see them with her. The series I am almost done with, on the other hand, is A Series of Unfortunate Events. It hit me like a truck when the parents on the show finally meet with their children and they are not the Baudelaires. They tell you from the very beginning of the show, even the theme song's chorus repeats it every episode, this is not a happy show. This won't have a happy ending.

It makes me think about 500 days of Summer, and its very beginning that warns you that it isn't a boy love girls story.

I think about that movie and how I liked it. He was a writer and I identified with him. I liked the cinematography and writing. I loved the scene of the juxtaposition of both expectations and reality. I recommended it to M, when we were still a couple. She hated it. At first I suspected it might be because of an identification with the character Summer.

Those first viewings I hated her. I saw her as the antagonist, the evil one, the one who did the wrong. Later I saw it the other way around. Until not long ago, Catherine told me that I was in Summer's place. And she's right. I behaved just like her. I treated Catherine as she treated the protagonist. I told her since the very beginning that I didn't want anything serious. That I wasn't looking for a relationship and kept my distance.

I didn't see it.

I had the meeting with Paola, the psychologist that works with the Transgender Association. I met her and saw again Ana and Melissa. "Since she arrived I saw her as Sofia, she's Sofia". Melissa mentioned the old name and it stung. Not really hurt me, more like a distasteful pinprick.

We talked about the project, or projects. In the short term they're looking and trying to plan an educational program of empowerment to Trans Women. We will collaborate with the design of the curriculum and the looking of bibliography. The second project is a kind of demographic study about the Trans population here.

The talking wasn't just about social programs, it was about research, about field work, making project proposals and designing protocols, looking for funds in the UCLA and the William's Institute. It was amazing, motivational, just wonderful.

I told just little to Catherine wanting to wait until tomorrow to tell her everything.

"It wasn't really like 'I wish I could stay so I can continue with this program', but yeah, a little"

The way there was really stressing. I left 45 minutes before the meeting time. I took the 5&10 thinking I could just take the freeway and arrive shortly. The traffic stopped me even before the under-bridge. I re-routed through the Ermita street but hit a stop at the Aguacaliente Blvd. From there the stoplights were eternal. It wasn't that I caught all the red ones, but even the greens were immobile. The worst was arriving to Paseo de los Heroes, the roundabout just before the Plaza and waiting two 5 minute red lights, with a minute green light inbetween.

I used the claxon when the red light kept shinning and when the green changed, I used it even more.

I got there half an hour after the meeting time. We will meet two days before my departure. Three...

Paola offered me to introduce me to Ruby, the leader of the organization, and said they have lots of contacts with whom I can stay there.

I'm doing it. I am really doing it. My life is taking form.



## 2017-01-17

L is resting their head on the side of my grandma's bed. When I climbed the stairs to enter the restroom, I saw them with their head on Grannie's stomach. She whispered something to them while caressing their head. Something about happiness. In the messages that I have with Catherine is one where I tell her that They seem weird. He came down with a sad and burdened face. Their headphones seemed to hide them from reality and its cruelty. I moved my head up as if asking what was wrong. He just shook it dismissively.

I have a new purse. It's a dark red almost looking like purple. "It's burgundy", is what Catherine said when I said out loud my thoughts about its color. It's small and has a zipper to guard its contents. I can't help but think about L wishes of having one. They want one way more than I ever did.

Yesterday we agreed to going to the United States. The plan stayed as going shopping, looking around for an agenda and eating at chip0tle.

Honestly, after Catherine fell asleep last night without agreeing on the terms of today, I thought the date would be cancelled. She said she's been feeling ill lately. The bottle with water spilt inside her backpack and wetted her work shirt. She blames that as the cause of her flu symptoms.

But she didn't really fall asleep. After some minutes she returned and the plans were set. She'd pick me up around 10 in the morning. We'd go. We could go to Ross and see some clothes.

I fell asleep. I dreamed something, I guess. I feel as if I did.

I haven't cleaned my face from the make up. I woke up before my mother's departure in the morning. I took Nymeria outside like those old times. I should see the date of the supposed appointment with the vet. 25th of January. We are at the 17th. More than half of the month has passed by. Less than half a month do I have left until my first test and barely more than one until the second that I don't even know the majority of its contents.

Catherine said that Nymeria's habit of biting the bed, the stairs and lately the walls, might be because of anxiety. It's true. I haven't taken her outside lately. She gave me the advice of taking her for a walk. Now, as I'm writing this paragraph, I'm holding her between my arms on my lap. She's barking now. Maybe she wants off. I put her down.

These last few nights she's been sleeping on her bed. I keep inviting her to mine, but she prefers her own.

Why do I feel to blame about L's sorrows?

I wore the new pants I bought this last Sunday with my family at the Old Navy. The morning was cold. I had the plan of wearing the gray new blouse with Catherine, the new shoes and the old pants I bought with her when we went to Chula Vista Center, and specifically Hot Topic. They were some of the last male garments that I bought. I even remember the disappointment I felt when I realized I had paid 30 dollars for a pair of pants that I well could had bought with my parents.

It was a nice surprise noticing how it was way harder to put them on, and not because of the thickness of my stomach.

I showered and shaved and got ready. Catherine arrived just at the time she said she would. We crossed the border around noon. The line wasn't long but it took its time. Little after we entered the building, I decided to stay at the right lane. When we approached the officers' booths, I noticed the woman who would attend us was taking her time and asking her questions. She held the cards and examined the pictures profusely. What would she say to me? This is not the first time that I am in this situation. Both my jeans and my hoodie were masculine. Even though there was no reason to be worried, I was relieved when the other office of the sentri booth called me.

We took the trolley and went down on Palomar. First we entered Office Depot but found nothing. They were expensive and not really noteworthy. Then it was Ross. Catherine had seen one and wondered about buying it to me. We found it but she was right, it was way too feminine for me.

Micheal's was next. There we both fell in love with the options and their discounted prices. Still, we decided to wait. Finally, in Target, we bought the cheapest ones we'd seen all day. We are both real happy with our purchases. Mine is a colored stripped notebook and hers has all this different patterns to be colored.

We both bought a blouse and I the purse I wrote about earlier. We ate at In N out. I convinced her to buy two burgers each. Maybe that wasn't such a good idea.

We crossed the border back and went to River Plaza. Dax and then the movies. She bought herself "tostilocos".

Before coming home, we stopped at a car wash.

Catherine and Anahi are talking about reuniting, going out. Maybe this Friday. Next's will be the departure party with the gang. Days keep getting busier.

I have a planner now to write everything and take them out of my mind and relax.

## 2017-01-18

"The days keep passing by faster than ever..." "Well, next one will be the last one won't it?"

Luis is right by my side. Sitting on the bed, he has the DSM 5 on his lap, and has opened it and browsed it. I glance at the page and see he's on the notes about Gender Dysphoria, the Differential Diagnoses.

There are two next weeks and I'll be leaving home. The openness of the one-way trip is a little disconcerting. I feel as if I'm wandering off to the edge of the world. I've seen already that it's not impossible. I have lots of options and opportunities. Rene reaffirmed it this session.

I will see him one or two more times. I've seen him for more than three years.

I woke up early from some terrible dreams. In the first one and only that I remember I re-experienced the disheartening horror of dysphoria as I haven't lived in a long time.

In the dream I'm talking to someone on the laptop. I know in some part of the dream I was actually playing videogames. It is some kind of reunion in a house. Here are different families and people. I've seen my friends and relatives. Anyway, I'm on the laptop with someone on my side video-chatting with someone else. In the screen I can see myself smiling cheek to cheek until I catch my glimpse. The smile vanishes as the the light after blowing on a candle. I don't like how I look. I seem weird and foreign. Is this really me? My face looks almost the same, but a little narrower and boxy. My hair is short, like when I attended high school.

I step out. Some things happen, but I can't recall any of them.

I'm outside in some kind of terrace. Catherine is next to me and Jessica in front. She looks different than how she really is. There is something with her teeth. Now she wears braces. In the dream she has no teeth but a single long one. I guess we're talking about how I feel, because she offers: "Why don't you just learn to care about yourself?"

I experience the known feeling about being in-comprehended. It's so sickening that it makes me turn and throw up over the fence. I faint.

The others are long forgotten.

I took Nymeria outside I think. We returned and went back to bed. After inviting her she did climb up and lied besides me. I hugged her close and we both fell asleep. It was almost noon when I finally answered back the messages in my phone. I talked with Catherine, telling her that I was exhausted. I wanted a day of leisure.

She asked me if I wouldn't be going out. I though about our meeting, she was referring about Rene. "It's tomorrow, isn't it? Fuck, it's today." I didn't have to review the messages from two weeks ago to confirm my fear. The same thing happened last week. I was convinced the session wasn't until Thursday.

The clock had two minutes left until reaching the highest point with both of its arms. I got up and looked at myself in the mirror. I didn't think that I looked that bad. My beard was barely noticeably and my hair wasn't totally a mess. It could be done.

I had sent a message to Catherine wondering if I could just send a message to Rene telling him that I wouldn't be able to attend. She mentioned how this would be one of the last sessions. I sent her a picture of my face asking her if it was blatantly obvious that I had just woken up. "Yeah", she told back.

I put on the burgundy jeans and the long-sleeved blouse I bought yesterday. I went upstairs to both rinse my face and shave with the machine. I put on a black beanie and a hoodie and it was done. I was ready. I left like that. I ate, nothing I think, and took my pills.

I got to Rene on time. I asked Catherine if she wanted me to go to her house. I could just come home, shower and eat something. She said it would be better to let it to some other time. We would lose much time if I ate and showered before. I don't mind. I have the document shared from Paola, and the rest of the uninterpreted tests of my patient and the themes I haven't really studied for the tests.


## 2017-01-19

I dreamed something. Differently than that other time that I relived the experience of frustration of hair dysphoria, this time I was and felt feminine. The first dreams were again in a scholar context. This wasn't the same location that repeats over and over in my dreams of the campus where I attended in grade school. This time it was a university, except that it wasn't the one I know and am familiar with.

I shared the classroom with Catherine. One of the professors attended after a series of missing classes the whole semester and gave some sort of speech about his grading rubric and shit. For the firs time in my whole life, the students dared to raise their voice. And I was one of those. Catherine was first and said how she saw it unfair. I defended her against the illogical rebuttals of said professor. I can't remember textually what was said.

Then, in a change of scenery we were all in some sort of hall or theater. Another professor, this time a woman, was giving some sort of cathedra. The students weren't conformed with what was said. Some got up and left. Then others until most did.

Finally in the last scene, somehow I reunited with a classmate of grade school. Ismael, I think he's called. He used to have a sister when I knew him. I think she's younger than him. Their mother is a medical doctor. I haven't seen him since 6th grade. No, I haven't talked to him since jr high. I had hacked Xennia's e-mail. I knew her password, and in a burst of guilt I confessed and told her to change it. Maybe that was the reason we stopped talking. The last time I talked to him was when in a instant messaging conversation he asked me, no, told me, to give Xennia her password back. It was a misunderstanding. In those times what was habitually referred as hacking was when somehow, usually through social engineering, yo change their password and locked them out of their account. He thought I had done that and refused to "return back" her account. But that wasn't it. I tried to explain that there was nothing to return. I told her to change it if she wanted to, but that was the most I could do. He kept insisting to just give her password back, so I ignored him.

Both of us liked her. I think she was my first crush. Sweet innocent infatuation. More than 12 years later I'm a transgender woman in a lesbian relationship and she's probably asexual. Who would had known?

In the dream I was invited by him to his house. He showed me a room where there were lots of pictures. I recognized some people in them that I really don't know. And lastly, on the last few, I saw myself when I wasn't actually myself. A young little boy with short hair and sad eyes playing the piano, and in other posing with his parents to the camera failing to smile.

"I guess I have changed a lot".

Before that he had looked at me and asked me with a face of wonder if the hormonas had changed my Adam's apple. I told him I didn't have much to change.

His mother arrived and noticed me. She asked me if I was there to visit, I can't remember the name she said but I assumed it was his sister. I told her no, that I was with him. She made some face and a comment. I think it was "Wow, right about time". It was awkward but at the same time, validating.

I woke up.

I didn't do much today but sleep. My mother left in the morning because the classes weren't officially suspended. She and Luis arrived an hour after noon. I was woken up several times in the morning. One of those was a call from Lili asking me when was my birthday. I told her the date and she was amazed that it had passed already. We set a date for a celebration. I told her something nice and calm, and mentioned the Cafe del Mundo. It will be next Wednesday around 5.

Catherine left for work and came back.

I haven't really studied but I did advanced the projects of Paola. I added a Unit about Communication to the program and found some references. Today I downloaded various articles about Transgender people. Mostly are in english and just two are regional or in Spanish. I could use those to hunt for more references later.

## 2017-01-20

The plan of this day was supposed to be that I'd get up in the way early morning. I remember setting the alarm by 8 the first one, a second one half an hour later and the last, as an emergency, to 9:20. I had calculated roughly that I would be needing time to shower, brush my teeth, shave and do all of my morning ritual with enough spare to be able to go to the Municipal Palace and do the procedure of solicitation for the copies of my birth certificate. I didn't know how much time would I need. I didn't even know if there would be a parking lot available for me to use. After doing all of that, it was a must that I'd be available before noon so I could see my patient for his last session of testing.

I don't remember if I dreamed something. This has become some sort of cliche in all of my writing. Either I spent several paragraphs on the dream of the night. Like yesterday's that more than half of the entry was about narrating the dream I had, specially because of its difference to the one before which reminded me of the very known but recently forgotten sensation of dysphoria. Either that, or that phrase.

I was in grade school, older than 7 but younger than 12, when I was in the car and my godmother mentioned something about dreams. We dream all nights, she said proudly of her new discovered knowledge. "I don't", I told her. I tried to remember and there were countless nights dark and black. That weird occurrence of closing my eyes in the night and opening them by day. An eye blink that last the whole night. "No, you do. It's just that you don't remember".

I didn't believe her. There must had been a mistake or her information was wrong. It wasn't that I didn't remember. I knew about those times, getting out of bed with the experience and knowledge of that different reality and seeing that life drift away into oblivion and vanish.

I grew up, and I left that circumstance along with the rest of the memories about her and them and those times.

In school I researched about the stages of sleep, I knew about REM stage and their duration and nature. In college I review them and actually understood them. I left behind the concept of dreams as these metaphysical manifestations of a different reality or a premonition of the future. I don't even buy the psychoanalytical stance of unconscious manifestations of repressed emotions or pulses.

I got up not at 8 nor 8 and a half. I even postponed the 9:20 alarm to ten minutes later. I enjoyed all of that time of sleep and rest. The bed with fresh cleaned sheets was a delight I had completely forgotten about. Even Nymeria, I think, accompanied me after the sun rose and my father left to work.

I showered and shaved and did all of the things I do in the morning. My outfit wasn't feminine but it wasn't masculine either. I wore the red hoodie and black leggings that look like skinny jeans. I didn't wore any make up. I expected to be asked about my name and information. I didn't know how the people would react.

I left the house around 10 and a half. It was raining, but since the classes were suspended since yesterday, I assumed there would not be as mush traffic as another rainy day. I drove as if I would be going to my mother's school. The trip my father took countless of times when I was in jr high or had L's age. This time I was driving the jetta. It was actually the same car that my father drove me in. And this time my hair is long. And I don't look like an Ivan.

I got there but found no parking lot. Not close, anyway. There was one with space on the other side of the "White offices". I walked across them and the ICBC in the rain, with my dark red tennis of canvas soaking wet. I got to the Palace and asked for information. The woman in the booth was actually nice. I got inside and again, asked for information on the Civil registry. I waited in line until I was called. Nobody asked me any information. I gave the copy and just stated that I wanted three copies and they had to be "Fidel copies of the book". I went to the cashier and paid.

I saw my patient. Lili waited with me in the waiting room until her patient arrived. She asked me some questions. First if I was already attended. I told her I was waiting for My patient. "Oh, so you are a psychologist, then." She used the feminine word.

Lately, I assume that all the times people gender me correctly they do it out of a niceness and support.

I came back home and the light went out for like half an hour. Luis did have his session. L did have their session. When they returned, I heard my mother whisper something to my dad. She told me that she had to ask me some things. I kept insisting and she told me what about. The psychologist told her that L does act differently with her. L lets themselves be however they feel. They also keep some information.

The therapists asked my mom about signs that I would have caught. She didn't believe her when she told her that I was surprised. "Sit with your daughter and ask her for the subtle signs she caught, ages and timeframes. She must had seen something"

I did. Oh sure, I did.

## 2017-01-21

I'm on my bed after hitting myself falling from the stairs. There is No internet. I returned from cathys house. I did studied today.

Inwont be doing the whole entry.


## 2017-01-22

The day before today I cheated. I had returned from Catherine's house and there was no internet home. I used my mother's phone to made the words. I didn't had the energy nor patience to type them all in the little keyboard of that iphone.

It was Saturday, the first day of my second to last weekend before the trip. I had talked with Catherine about plans of meeting, seeing each other. We haven't seen the latest episodes of Sherlock. In the morning, no, the night before, we both fell asleep talking about it. We didn't agree on anything. It was my turn to drive, so I would be the one going to her house instead of her, even though I had the episodes recorded in my DVR.

Eventually, in the morning, she told me that she would be going out with her mom to Costco and some other places. Maybe she could ask to return earlier so we could meet. At the end we decided against it, so I didn't shower and stayed in bed reading about cualitative research methodology.

In the afternoon she sent me a message that she was already home. Had I showered by then? And she laughed. I hadn't. I didn't feel like it. I had given up to the opportunity of seeing her. Thinking about showering and changing and getting ready was a bother that I preferred to avoid. I had to study. I have to. The days keep getting fewer. The number is going down and I'm afraid I'll end up failing the exam because of hubris.

I used that as an excuse. Catherine bought it at first but then let show her disagreement with it. "But... no, you're right, you do have to study". "...It's just a little upsetting that you study just in my free day."

She was right. I told her to give me an hour and I'd be leaving. I showered and put on jeggings, the same ones I'm wearing. The ones I used a year and a half ago in my first Pride Parade, and the ones I bought the first times I went clothe shopping with her full of nerves and fear. I wore them and the blue blouse I bought with my mom. The one that's labeled as a "boyfriend" cut. It's styled as a garment of clothe that a girl borrows from her boyfriend. It's made just to look as if it's ill-fitting. I don't know if it's a little ironic or just paradoxical that after my transition I sometimes keep using men clothes with the sole intention of them looking "unfit".

I arrived at her house. She was out in the balcony when I parked the car. I had already eaten the second biscuit from the morning, but she told me that we would eat at her house. She and her mother bought ribs like the other time that I went. We ended up watching a movie instead of the sherlock episodes.

Her mother gendered me correctly the whole time. Her father, on the other hand, slipped some times in the plural words.

Was it yesterday, too? L had asked me to borrow the 3DS cable. I could not find it. Maybe it could be on the shelf where all of the cables and stuff lies while I look for a place to put them. Maybe it was behind the night table, connected since the last time that I used it. The reason L wanted it was because their cable was broken.

I looked for it after not being able to locate it. Had I lost it? He had just given it to me. It was where it was supposed to be. I opened the door to give it to them, but L was already with our father trying to repair the broken one. I left it on the table. 5 or 10 minutes later that they finished. My dad told them to bring me back the cable.

"Dale el cable a... uh, regresaselo".

He stopped himself from making a reference to me. He avoid using the old name, but didn't dare to pronounce mine. It was an uncomfortable laugh.

The internet came back shortly after I had done the words.

Ive been watching the series The OA. I'm just one or two episodes until the end.

I have a backache that's been upsetting me. It started mildly today, but as the night has been setting it has been getting worse. I hope it fades away soon. I should lie down on the bed and rest. Tomorrow I have to get up early and go to the lab. 6 weeks after my session with the endo is supposed to fall on Thursday, but I worry that he would want to see me soon and I won't have time to meet before my departure.

Time is running fast and catching up.

## 2017-01-23

I'm cold. My fingers are stiff and kind of frozen. Each movement is like the breaking of ice cubes. It's not unbearable, on the contrary, the cold is something that brings me back to my first days in Spain. The only time that I remember being colder than then is once that we went to the Theater of the university to see someone's school show. I can't remember if it was Luis' or Miguel's. Probably the latter. I was wearing the hoodie that I sometimes use for staying home, except then it was new. I remember thinking about finding someone known and being recognized. The wind was piercing, like a sharp dagger that scraped the bones. Every blow was a penetration that went through the clothes and skin. I've never been colder than then.

Was it in the morning or late at night that I cancelled the alarm? I should be getting to bed soon. In the agenda is written for today the appointment with the lab. I had the alarm set to 7 in the morning. I reconsidered and postponed it to today. It's not the beginning of the week, but I could use the opportunity of going out to pick up my birth certificates on the way. I had thought about taking Nymeria to the vet and then going to the lab, but I guess I'll just take her Wednesday in some free time I find. Later my parents can take her to shower and getting her hair cut. I'll be leaving her in a little more than a week.

I finished grading the tests and almost done with the evaluation report. I haven't talked with Lili about making the appointment of our patient to deliver him the results. I guess I can deliver the report to her to read it beforehand. I think I'll leave the conclusion for tomorrow. As soon as I finish these words I'll get into bed and sleep.

Tomorrow will be another free day for my mom and L. Miguel will return to classes normally. The showers haven't stopped.

Wednesday will be my second to last session. I haven't decided if I'll tell Rene to close the process right then and there. Maybe the last session could be the day before my departure.

Catherine sent me a message some moments ago telling me, the University sent us some information about the time and place of the exam and it requires us to answer back with a confirmation. I had seen the notification in the home screen of my phone but it was just the telling of a new message, there was no sign of its importance.

Little more than a week.

"I'm both excited and scared about our leaving".

Today I marked some apartments that I found on the listing page. The prices are different but the zone is almost the same.

I have still the backache that's been annoying me for a couple of days. I remember the time we flight to Guadalajara I had it as well, one or two weeks before our departure. Today it was worse than ever. My mother told me to make some pasta. Then she and L could go to Costco. I did it or at least tried. Looking for the spaghetti was excruciating, but trying to hold the pan so I could fill it with water literally brought me to tears of pain and desperation. I climbed the stairs after looking for anti-inflammatories or pain relievers and not being able to find any. Upstairs I asked them. Seeing my mom still in bed after all day, and my grandmother not hearing me, made me scream at them.

I had to lie down. My father bought some at the pharmacy and they've really helped. My grandma prepared some tea. My mother did take my prescription and found some boxes. She returned with a plastic bag instead of the usual paper one. I asked her if they had it. She told me they did but they were expensive. I grabbed the bag surprised. She told me she payed 500 pesos for them. I looked at the receipt and checked. She bought 30 boxes of 14 pills each for 20 pesos each one. Less than a dollar. I paid the same amount a couple of weeks ago and they have almost ran out. The boxes will last me approximately three months.

How many boxes should I take with me? Will I last more than three months there?

Not even knowing how long I'll be there, is something that keeps me nervous.

## 2017-01-24

Without realizing it yet, I'm done with all the things that I had in mind. The report of the evaluation is finished and saved, waiting to be printed, signed and delivered. The three copies of the original birth certificate are in the folder. The results of the blood analysis are on the web. There is a message on my outbox of the cellphone, but because I have no credit it wasn't delivered right. There is another one telling me it was sent "upon charge", but I can't be sure that he'll read it. Tomorrow I'll buy some on my way to Rene. Nymeria is clean and with hair short. Like the phone credit I'll take her tomorrow for the medicine. There is half a tank full of gasoline in the car. The card is activated and I've set up a NIP. So it's all done. Item by item are being checked off my list.

I woke up early in the morning, not as soon as the first alarm, but before the last. Nymeria was by my side. The pain receded. I got up and showered. It was around 7 in the morning. I went masculine to the laboratory. Not like the first time that the beard could be seen and my clothes were all masculine but the underwear, but similarly. It was the same jeans but the purple blouse. On top I wore a red think hoodie. I didn't apply any make up. I think it's the first time that I went to the lab without. Did I wear some the last time?

I'd be lying if I wrote that I was calm and sure. I got out of the car was received by the same man who opens the door. I've been there 6 times, or is it 5?, to that same place. I was called as Miss Sofia by the cashier and asked some information. Everything usual. I saw the paper and noticed the big F on the gender marker. Everything was safe.

I passed to the chair and the questions continued. They always asked about my medication, and I've always wondered if that's information enough to assume of me being trans. Usually young people don't take hormones, less with a diuretic with known effects of being antiandrogen.

I was sitting on the chair, I don't remember it the blood was already drawn or not. The phlebotomist looked at me and asked something that I didn't quite got. She repeated herself "when was your last menstruation?". I smiled shyly and told her "I don't have them".

Maybe she glanced at the order and specifically the medication I listed. Maybe she had noted some signs but not realized it completely. She looked at me again, and wondered: "oh, like transgender?" "Yes" I replied.

I guess it would have to happen sooner than later. I smiled and kept smiling along the day.

I noticed in the paper that I could pick up the certificates from noon until 2pm. It was way too early, so I returned home. I decided to take Nymeria to the vet, I could get her the profilactic and ask about the haircut and bath. I left her there. They took her. They checked twice, even three times that she had all of her vaccines. They would call me around noon to pick her up. Again I returned home. It was, lonely. It hasn't been really unusual opening the door to find and empty house. I guess I've grown accustomed to the hopping joy of Nymeria's reception. How will I do without her next week?

I told my mom about my picking up of the certificates and she offered me the keys of the parking lot in her school. I arrived and was walking towards the Palace when my phone rang to tell me that I could pick Nymeria up. It was surrounded and guarded by police. My father told me yesterday how it was closed because of the manifestation recently and it being taken. The police had the entrance guarded and were asking all the people entering of their motive and destination. When the officer looked at me, he asked me with just a "girl".

I told him and he let me pass. Will I stop being nervous about the presence of authority? I can't imagine how it would had been had I gone like this to pick up my militar service card.

Tomorrow I'll see Liliana. I sent her a message asking her when to see our patient but she didn't answer. This is the last one before my trip. I don't know when will I return. It could be months, it could be just a couple of weeks. I could just write that this is the last report I'll have her sign for me, just then the return after the two failed exams and continue in her office.

I hope I can find some place to live soon and make the changes to my papers. That would be good enough. More than enough.


## 2017-01-26

The front pocket of my gray hoodie is broken. Nymeria bit it and I didn't realize it until it was already too late. Yesterday I cheated the words. I had time to do them. There was an hour until midnight when I was home, but I decided not to. Did I cheat in my home or before returning?

It was a long day. I had thought about taking Nymeria in the morning, but decided against it. I slept the extra hours and got up just having enough time to get ready before therapy. I showered and shaved. What did I wear? I put on the black jeans and a striped white long sleeved t-shirt. I left without any make up. Rene's was my first stop and errand of the day.

I drove there. I parked the car where I usually do. It was before that, though. I was on the turn from the Las Americas Blvd, where the street is closed and you have to make a U-turn to get into the other boulevard. There was a traffic congestion there. I made the turn and barely found space so I could let the traffic continue up-way behind me. After two red lights and staying on that turn, I glanced to my right to the man in the black car next to me. It was a young man, unknown to me. He wore a camouflage beanie and a light blue jacket. He noticed my sight and met it. There was a woman next to him, and a young girl on the backseat. I could just see the hair from the lady in the front. It was a straight long dirty blonde hair. Familiar hair. But it could not be. She works an office job, why would she be driven by some man with a child? The woman was turning to the other way.

By then I had already returned my eyes to the road. So I turned again, just to confirm it wasn't her. It would bring an end to that neurotic uneasiness of my mind. She barely turned but the man's face was still on the way. Just her lips and mouth were seen. Pink pouty lips on a white face. Familiar lips. Really, it couldn't really be her, could it?

The lights changed and the black car's lane got to move before mine. It was a black Mirage. The name was a teasing wordplay.

I mentioned that situation with Rene, and then later with Catherine when I arrived at her house. She didn't seem to like it that much.

I went to Catherine's I offered her to bring her to my home and take a uber to the office. I asked her to seeing her earlier, just after my session. We went and picked up the pizza. We barely eat and came home. We had just enough time. Here Nymerie tried to climb her legs and jumped to meet her. I finished with my make up and we left.

There was a meeting with a friend of Lili's. I didn't notice at first she was deaf. I thought it would be awkward the communication with her. She reads lips and talks fluidly, but... there was something. Do people feel that way about me, when they know my "situation"?

Something in her story almost brought me to tears. Was it the part about having a secret and living this two lives? Some part of her being hidden from everyone, from the world.

From there Iris gave us a ride to both Catherine and me to the Cafe. We drank and ate. It was nice. Graciela, the director of APSOR, accompanied us. It was really nice. I am glad of meeting her.

Today was another day. Yesterday we set the meeting with Lucas, my latest patient. This evening at 5. I did nothing today but wait 'till then. Both of us waited 20 minutes to Lili to receive us. I had thought she was with a patient, but she had forgotten about the appointment. I gave the results. It was a little awkward when Lili gave him an ultimatum. He has to meet with the psychiatrist before their meeting this Saturday.

I shared with him my experience with both depression and gender dysphoria. The utility of the medication calming the numbness and the fog of the mind.

Tomorrow I'll see the gang.

My dad approached me when he got home. It was awkwardly and clumsy. He asked about the hotel where I would be staying. Then he asked me when was I planning on returning. I told him it depended on how everything went.

"Return, came home and you can go back later", It wasn't an order but it didn't feel so much as a proposition either. Was it a begging?

Does he want me home? Does he want me here? Does he want me safe?

Or is he just not ready to let his son go and not returning?

## 2017-01-28

It's been both a short and tired day. The countdown on the assistant page in my phone keeps getting smaller. 0 and the departure day are closer than ever.

"Happy trip, Cath and Sofy", says the cartel that Chevo and Jessica made for us. Did I do something yesterday besides the planned? I don't remember most of the early day. It was Friday. Both L and my mom went to school. Miguel was away, as well. I slept with Nymeria and postponed, again, taking her to the vet. It's been three days since the supposed one that I should had taken her to take a profilactic.

L is in the living room watching the "Chumel Torres show". I tease him about it, but I think my dad sometimes sees it, too.

Yesterday I got out of my room in the early morning before they left. I ate two burritos and then returned to bed. I took my pills. The organizer is empty, should be filling it now.

I showered and got ready. I painted my nails. I even shaved my legs after I don't know how many weeks. I put on my clothes and did my hair. I even applied make up. It was going to be a party. It was supposed to be a farewell gathering in Paola's home.

I told Catherine she could come here and we could both take a ride from my dad. She agreed. The Uber's fare to my house was estimated at first at 120 pesos the first time she checked it before getting ready. Later, it was estimated at 180. I told her I could go pick her up and bring her here, she could give me the 100 pesos that she was going to pay at first.

I had already asked my dad to give me a ride, so he was a little confused when I asking him to move the car. I left the house around 7 in the afternoon. I was passing the oxxo downhill when in a message she told me that the fare now was around 80 pesos. I was at her house waiting for her to come out when I saw the offer in Facebook. It was a job offer of one of the Associations that care for Trans Rights locally. They were recruiting a HIV and health promoter, someone in the field of psychology or social work with experience with the care of minorities. It was a perfect fit. The offer had a limit to the first of february. The day before we leave.

From her house we picked some stuff at Paola's. The cooler with the beard that was left from the christmas party.

We were around Diego, her son. We were called his aunts. It feels both weird and kind of sweet. She gave us a gift. It was some kind of pouch or bag, small but useful. I know I'll find a use for it.

I remember an old dream I had of me being in the capital and the process of application to the master. I know it won't be anything like that.

Although I can't help but return to my nervousness about the process of boarding the trip or getting into the test. When I make my bags I have to make sure, completely sure that I take with me all of the papers necessary. Both of the original receipts of the bank, the printed pass to the test and my identification.

We got to Paola's. Her boyfriend and Andrea and Rafa were already there. Most of the night everyone addressed me and treated me correctly. Just once did I hear Andrea exclaim "Catherine and Ivan should play, so they get the chance".

We drank and laughed, we played and ate. We danced and sang. I got home around 5 in the morning. I woke up by 10 in the morning. L came down to my room and told me they were going to the United States and if I wanted to shower. I asked him if Miguel was ready, and if not, I'd go after him.

The second time he came I noticed my nausea and lack of energy. I was way too tired. I decided against it.

I sleep the rest of the morning. I've been reading, maybe I will finish the book before leaving. Tomorrow we'll celebrate L's birthday. Just 5 days. Monday I'll have to gather with the girls of the assoc. I'll meet RubÃ­. I should gather some more references or information. Maybe tomorrow.

## 2017-01-29

This is the end of my last weekend before my leaving. We celebrated the birthday of L in advance. I'm sitting in the computer with my pajamas on and my face cleansed. In Facebook, specifically the group of the assoc., is the confirmation to tomorrow's meeting. I made some comments and looked for some references, too.

Why do I feel like I haven't given much, then?

Am I nervous about meeting with the other girls? Will I meet some of them?

I woke up in the morning and heard the voice of my dad and L. I could had sworn that there was a paper-bag rustling. I excited my room and went to see. My dad was telling L there was no point in him buying breakfast. Then we would not get up until noon and eat it, and we were supposed to go out an eat.

I returned to bed and slept again. I know I dreamed, I dreamed lots and lots of different things. I woke up with an exhausted mind and can't remember almost nothing of those.

It was one of the afternoon when I got out of bed again. My mom was in the couch under a thick blanket Both my dad and L were ready. I felt tired and lacking energy and motivation. Am I nervous? There are just three complete days.

Tomorrow I will be leaving around two in the afternoon. Tuesday I told Catherine I could go to her house and help her with her bag. She could help me with the search of an apartment. Then, Wednesday, she told me she would come to my house to help me with my bag. Then we could continue with the look for a place of staying.

And then the waiting is over. I've been thinking about moving the books and references for studying to my kindle.

I haven't forgotten about my lack of interest in the supposed unknown subjects. They are several and I haven't even made an intent in making some research.

My mom showered after me, and then it was Miguel's turn. When he was getting ready I was chatting with Catherine. Maybe she could come with us, be with us. She had just gotten out of her shift and was on her way to Mexico. She crosses the border several times a week.

Nymeria is wandering around her own bed looking for a placer to set. I like looking at her and forgetting I won't have her with me at nights by the end of this week. Will I miss her more than she will me?

My dad and L went out to buy some material. The waiting was just for them. I told Catherine we could wait some for her, but understood if she didn't want to. She declined. I will see her soon, anyway.

My grandma heated some chicken and ate some salad with it. She had to take her pills, she said. She was waiting for us to leave in the morning.

We got to Friday's. The waitress called me miss several times. It would be encouraging and validating if it weren't for my own projecting myself into L place when I heard his high voice and she called them 'young them'. Do they feel as I felt before transitioning? Or is it more like the pain after I had already told people and thought I was seen androgynously.

I ordered a burger. So did Miguel. I ordered a Long Island Ice tea. It was the first time that I drink that. I liked it. It had tequila, rum, gin and vodka.

I guess L did have a good time. I asked my dad to stop by the grocery store to buy Nymeria some food and the pharmacy so I could buy some pills. We stopped in the River Plaza. My mother came with me to the pharmacy. She gave her card and I gave her a 500 bill after she extended her hand. I guess my father noticed, because this evening, instead of 600 he gave me a thousand pesos.

I have around 6000 counting the the money I will use for therapy and the one I have to give Catherine for the stay in the hotel.

Were I not to find any place to stay, I guess I would go the second to last day of Catherine's stay to a motel and asked how does it work with me being a trans person. I should not think about failing the search.

I don't know what will happen. I have several days. I will find something. Everything will work out alright.

## 2017-01-30

The days are even fewer. Three is marked in black numbers in the first box on the help screen of my phone. I had my first appointment of the week today. I reunited and met with Paola B, Melissa, Ana and got to meet RubÃ­, the activist of the Association. She is the director. "I've worked 8 years for free, so I know how is it."

Should I add Abyss on Facebook. I unfriended him, no. He's still in my friends' list, except he's in the other one. He didn't add me like the rest of my now friends. Why would he? We never had a real relationship. Sure, he was my teacher for a semester. But I doubt he remembers me, even as the person I used to be.

Catherine hasn't answered in almost an hour. She sent me some messages while we were in the meeting, she was getting off her shift and arriving home. She reminded by herself that I was busy. I answered back when the meeting was over.

How was my day?

I remember dreaming, I remember Nymeria in my dream, I remember the feeling of being in a male body, being male identified. Just yesterday I read a reference about a mexican article which studied the dreams of a transgender population. The ones who started their transition younger were statistically more probable to dream themselves as their respective gender.

My dreams, how are they?

Mostly I don't notice whom or what I am.

This time, even in my dreams were an exhaustion that accompanied me to my awoke state. I had Nymeria by my side sharing the bed under the covers. My body was heavy, immovable. It weighted tons and I was the weakest person on earth. The sleep grasped me and pulled me back. The alarm sounded and even then it was harder than ever to get out of it.

Finally I did. Grandma told me how she left me some eggs in a plate. I ate breakfast by her side and took my pills. Before the organizer is empty by the end of the week I will be sleeping in a strange bed. By the next time it will be empty again, I'll be by myself in a foreign place.

Catherine hasn't answered back.

I showered and got dressed. It was hard deciding what to wear. Should I go formally as last time?

In the morning while I was still in bed Catherine mentioned how the big, huge panties she bought at ...

Nymeria just peed on my bed. I turned after leaving the laundry basket on the floor so I could put apart the clothes when I'm finished with this. She climbed the bed and started sniffing it as a strange object. As I took my sight back and then returned it, I noticed her with her vulva on the mattress and her legs arched. I screamed at her and she stopped. I pushed her down and noticed the long dark spot of liquid.

Just thinking about not sleeping anymore with her is breaking my heart a little. She hasn't tried to climbed the bed since the third time that I pushed her down.

The message from Catherine in the morning says, "the underwear that I bought yesterday fits me" and a concerned face. I don't recall exactly how the subject came, but she mentioned that ... oh, right, she asked me if I wanted to go to the birria's tacos that are close to the office. I asked her about when.

"I was thinking about tomorrow in the morning, and from then I could go to your house to help you with the baggage. I think it's better than Wednesday that the day is cut by your therapy.

I said that if I made the suit tuesday, I would need to leave clothes out for both wednesday and thursday, without to count the ones that I'd be wearing that day. That was what I said, but besides that there was something that bothered me about changing the plans we already had.

We haven't talked much today. There was that in the morning, and then my course.

The local study that would had been done on the local trans population might become national.

Rubi gave me her card and offered me help with a contact she had in there who works in the registro civil and also could help me in case I don't find anywhere to live.

It's reassuring having a back up plan, or knowing of something else in case something comes up wrong.

When I told Catherine, I said I would contact her later. I guess she took in the wrong way. She said she didn't understand why not now. She could help me with a place to stay. I tried to explain to her that I'm not comfortable reaching out instantly to her. Preferable I would like to live near the University. She insisted, I know it wasn't her intention, but I felt again pressure on something that it's hard for me and I haven't felt any support on her behalf.

That was the last messages she sent me.

I try to change the subject, asking about the time we would see each other tomorrow. But she ignored my question and just commented how the dollar is lower. She hasn't answered since then. In a quarter it will be two hours since that comment of hers.

She had mentioned that she felt sick with her food and was trying to puke when I just got home. Maybe it's that. Maybe she fell asleep.

I don't know.

It's been typical lately that the plans stay shapeless the night before until the morning when we have to give them form in a hurry.

Maybe we won't see each other neither tomorrow nor after.


## 2017-02-01

The entry from the day before today is plagued with the word cheater. Why did I do that? I remember being tired. No, I was in bed. In the early evening. In the morning I got up and showered. Catherine would come pick me up, we'd be going to eat breakfast after... what was she going to do?

It wasn't. I think I stayed in bed while she showered. She proposed me to bring the birria instead of picking me up and going ourselves to that recommended place. I showered and got ready pretty fast. She came and picked me up. I did not wore make up. My clothes were leggings and a loose sweater. Everyone gendered us correctly. We did go to the "Tio Pepe"'s. I ordered two tacos of birria and one of potatoes. They were all really good. We returned home and she helped me browse for apartments. It was disheartening. Was they after or before the bag? It was after it. At first we returned from the restaurant and I met the clothes taken out of the drying machine.

It was rushing, and stressing, she wanted to start but I had to put the clothes back to the closet. She didn't understand why did I have to, if we were going to put them in, anyway. Finally I did, and we started. We were going in order, first pants, then t-shirts, then long-sleeved blouses, hoodies, dresses, etc... Until we went through all of my closet. The pants were dirty. I just put them apart and threw them to the washing machine.

When the bag was filled with the clothes that I'd be putting in later, I set it aside and we sat in front of the computer to see the apartments. We browsed the ones I had marked and then made some new searches. It was really disheartening noticing the majority of them asking for only girls. Thinking about asking for information and being rejected because of the information in my official papers or my genitals makes me feel hopeless. After looking and saving several of them I lied on the bed and shyly cried and hugged Nymeria. I don't know if Catherine noticed or not.

She left after an hour, maybe. I don't remember what else did I do. In the evening I was really tired and went to bed. I slept and didn't got up until late at night. When I exited the room, both of my parents and siblings were already home.

Today was and is another day. The last day before the trip. I got up in the morning knowing it would be harder tomorrow to leave Nymeria on the bed. I went to Rene. I stopped at the bank and filed a deposit of two thousand pesos to my debit card. With Rene it really was a closing session. I starting talking about how I remembered or recalled the first time I went to his office. How different did I looked then than how I do now. We continued on that train of thought. All the changes I've gone through, what I've accomplished and what was something that was left to work with.

He gave me a palming on the shoulder similar to the one that he gave on my last session as "Ivan".

"This time there won't be a "See you next time", I said mortified.

I've done this before. I've left home. I returned, except I didn't. Ivan left three years ago and I came back in his place, in his clothes and in his role.

Will something like that happen? Will I return differently? Will I make it? Will I came back triumphantly in more than a month from now? Or will it be like my father advised me, and I'll return defeated with my tail between my legs and my head sunk.

I'm smart, I'm strong and brave. I can make it. I can.

I have to study more. I have to read and prepare. The day after tomorrow, no, the one after that is the test.

I have to find a place to live. I have lots of things to do and worry about. Nymeria, nymeria, what will happen with her?

I have still the backpack and the handbag yet to fill. My laptop and books and notebooks. My pills. Will I hug her tonight? Will she be here waiting for me when I return. Will she still love me the same? Will I cry tomorrow before I leave?

Will I cry in a week after I'll be alone.

## 2017-02-02

I remember being in a hotel sitting just like this, with the computer in the desk and behind it a mirror in which I can see myself typing. This is the first entry in this new city. I've been here before in what seems as other different life. It was like 20 years ago. It was a different me and a different city. The only thing I remember is walking through a park, getting in a ride that resembled a working machine and taking a picture behind a wall with a cowboy and a horse painted with their faces being holes in which you pose.

Me, I am 20 years older, I am no longer a little boy but a grown woman.

I woke up four hours after midnight. Nymeria was in the bed with me under the sheets. At first she was energetic and biting. I could had let her go to her own bed, but knowing it was going to be the last night in who knows how many that I'd share with her, I insisted and grabbed her. Eventually we fell asleep. It's hard for me to even estimate the hours I did sleep. I remember putting an alarm half an hour before the hour I wanter the getout of bed. I was awake when it started playing. My heart broke when I left Nymeria on the bed even just for showering.

I got ready. I did my hair and put on the clothes. The bags were all ready. I played chess with L before leaving the house. I went for Nymi and grabbed her to the table with me. I wanted to be close to her.

Everyone came downstairs eventually. My father drove the pick-up with me and my siblings. First we took L to their school. On the way there he mentioned how they were 13 already and it came to me how it is their birthday. I didn't even hugged them. Will they miss me? They asked me since last night about playing chess but I had to answer negatively because I hadn't made the baggage.

The next stop after the jr high school that came after the grade school where both me and Miguel attended was the airport.

We got there around seven. My father parked and accompanied me to make the check in. I had just registered the suitcase when Catherine and her mom arrived. Catherine's mom called me beautiful. My mother posted a picture of me outside the house just leaving. I was wearing a closed hoodie, no make up and my hair tied back in a pony-tail. "Do I resemble Ivan?" I asked Catherine. That was the intention. I would need to appear like the person in my id to aboard the airplane. She had said that "uh, yeah(?)".

When I saw the picture that my mother posted, even then I looked feminine.

The flight was tiring. I fell asleep on the last third of it. I was coming and going in a state of dreams. I confused reality with my dreaming.

Arriving at the airport, we waited for our suitcases and took a cab to the hotel. From here we went straight to the meeting of roomies that was near Roma. We would need just to take a line of subway and three stops of the bus. It was tiring and stressful and annoying. I got lost getting into the subway station that's just two streets next to the hotel. In there Catherine asked for a card and was told that they didn't had any. Then, she asked for a ticket and was replied in a really rude manner.

When I asked for my own ticket, the salesman gave it to me and just stayed quiet. I asked him how much was it and he answered back, again, in the most patronizing way possible.

We were confused how to take the train the correct way. We stumbled a little but got to our destination. Later, when it was time to take the bus, we found out they didn't have any cards left and that was the only way to board. We had to ask for a favor to a passerby, which, when he tried, could buy one card.

We ate a burger. We got into the wrong building, and by when we had realized it I didn't have neither the energy, nor the will to socialize and meet new people.

I asked her to come back. It was the last of the busy hour. We were trapped in both the bus and the subway. It was weird boarding the first wagon exclusively for women. I felt as if I were intruding, as if I was incognito and could be discovered. Did that mean that all the women how saw me there, saw me as a woman? Maybe they thought I was like those men that were there by mistake or just because of carelessness.

Tomorrow we'll go to CU. I should look around to advices of apartments and ask for vacancy.

## 2017-02-03

Today, this moment, more than ever should I be studying or reviewing the information for the test for tomorrow. Right now it's eight o'clock in the afternoon. The only stuff that I've reviewed is what I've read in the first part of the flight to come here yesterday.

Catherine has uploaded a post to Facebook with a picture of herself in front of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. We went today to the University. We didn't got out of bed in the early morning. I asked her to come to sleep early after the itinerary we had yesterday. I was extremely tired, exhausted. Even after catching the movie of Sweeney Todd in the Warner Channel and loving that the songs were in their original english I couldn't stay awake. Catherine told me in the morning that she couldn't sleep and noticed how I did really fast.

It's been months since I've wanted to sleep by her side.

Did I shower before or after doing the words? Just stepping to the shower with her made me have an erection. I felt the skin stretch to the point of discomfort and it brought me a mixture of both pleasure and pain. It wasn't until the morning, though, before I was completely awake nor ready to get out and start the day, that we started kissing and touching our bodies.

There was a comment in the airplane of how I move a lot while I sleep, supposedly more when I am dreaming. Last night I was in a university. It wasn't the national one that we would visit later this day, but it wasn't either the one I am accustomed to. In there, I noticed a girl that resembled my ex. She had really short hair. Its tips were barely showing under the edge of a beanie. Later, when I passed through a classroom I saw a familiar coat and her backpack. I felt really uncomfortable. Why would I find her there? What could she be doing that would led her up to that place.

Later something happen with a classmate that wanted me to confront her. I remember, too, not wanting her to see me with the clothes I was wearing. I don't know exactly what were they. I thought how many other times I looked way more feminine. How do I usually dream about myself?

We took the metro after eating breakfast in the restaurant of the hotel. It was way more empty than yesterday's evening when we returned. We took it all the way to Copilco. It was a trip of around 40 minutes. Tomorrow we plan to wake up in the early morning and get ready to be leaving around 6 in the morning. We have to be there by 8 and a half, and the exam will start by 10.

We found the auditorium after struggling with the maps and the entrances.

Something happened just like that when, after leaving the university, we took a bus to a plaza to look for a ATM of my bank where I could withdraw money. We finally got to the mall but could not find the entrance. We wandered around and around but couldn't find the ATM. Later, when we ate in the colony where Andrea lived, I tried to withdraw from a different ATM and was charged 17 pesos.

In our trip around Copilco and Coyoacan we gathered the little pieces of paper with the numbers of the people offering them. Most of them asked for just a specific gender, or tutors who could aval the process or letters of recommendation.

I was really nervous about the process of calling or contacting them and explain my situation.

We got to the hotel and started with that. I dreaded the idea of using the phone and exposing my voice and history being vulnerable to discrimination. Sometimes we took the first wagons of the metro that is exclusive to women. I feel their eyes on me. I feel as an intruder. I don't have a piece of paper or something that validates me. I have nothing but my appearance.

When we exited the Sanborns, one of the people that passed us was a person visibly masculine with a skirt and a light sweater. They were noticeably uncomfortable, with a binder or notebook on their chest. I saw their eyes and found the fear sometimes I want to hide.

As soon as I finish these words I will get to study.

Tomorrow we'll see the first room. Then Sunday. I'm scared of taking them. I am scared of being denied. I am scared of not finding anything and end up homeless.

## 2017-02-04

The test is done. We've done it. I feel like a huge load has been taken off my shoulders. It was a short test, it could had been an ordinary semester exam from my time in the bachelor's. It wasn't hard, but it wasn't that easy either. I guess I was more nervous about the dealing with the registration and the id than the questions themselves.

Last night, we finished with the calls and messages of the rooms. I've seen the first one already, it's shared with two students of UNAM, one of math and the other of physics. I didn't told them I am trans, but I can't be sure that they didn't realize it. Tomorrow we'll visit the other two rooms that we agreed to. Both of them know about the discordance with my identity and the presentation and name of my id. They seemed okay with it. The first one, I told her out of despite and as a trial to see what would be sharing it with strangers. It's really hard, this feeling of being vulnerable, of being a marginal person.

After that we studied. She finished before I did. I stayed on the other bed with the screen lighted up and reading about the statistical analysis of testing of hypotheses. Not much later did I turned it off and accompanied her under the sheets. I took my pajama bottoms and hugged her. This time she fell asleep first and she was the one with the movements and the snoring. Not much after I slept as well.

It was around 5 hours of sleep that we got before the alarm brought us back to this foreign city. As I opened my eyes, a cold and sharp blow of air cut me in half. I felt it through the sheets, my skin and bones. It woke me up more than any cup of coffee would have.

I took the sheets with me to the bathroom and showered and got ready. I wore a male shirt, I tied my hair and didn't wore any make up.
I looked ambiguos enough to lessen my worry about the procedure and not too much to feel it unbearable.

We took the metro a couple of minutes after it opened and still it wasn't that empty. We got to Copilco and stopped at a mexican dinner to eat breakfast. The waitress didn't gender us. We waited in the faculty outside the auditorium. There were lots and lots of people, easily enough we surpassed the thousands.

The exam wasn't that hard. More than half of the questions I answered with the surety that they were correct. A quarter, I guess I think of them correctly, but they might be wrong. The rest, though, I hesitated before putting my answer, and most of them even changed it afterwards.

I won't know the results until the end of March, more than a month from now. It's time enough to deal with the papers and procedures.

After the test and killing some time around Copilco, we went to the subway station where we would meet with the potential roommate that would show us the room. He was the only one that didn't know really about my transness, but I was wearing ambiguos clothes and it might had been noticeable. Neither he nor the other roommate made any comment or face. He even recognized me from far away as we exited the oxxo.

We came back to the room, the subway was as full, maybe even a little more, as the first day. Because of how I looked, I didn't feel comfortable enough to wander there, even if the crowd were less constricting. We experienced the first time a man pushing and getting into the line.

We got here and stopped near the market to buy some food. We got to menus to go and ate them half-naked here in the room. I bought eggs and longaniza and she, meat. It was really good. After the food and the day, I was exhausted. We lied on the bed and I couldn't help to fell asleep.

In UNAM, we sat in the grass of the faculty of humanities, there was some kind of park were lots of dogs were running and playing. My mom sent me some messages and in them shared how Nymeria cries when the evening comes or sometimes just stays at the window whimpering. I miss her. Will she recognize me when I get back?

## 2017-02-05

Catherine is about to paint my toenails. I'm sitting on the bed, the one on the right, where we slept the first night in the city. She's lying on the other one, with the her suitcase next to her and her phone on the hands. We woke up again early but didn't really had a reason to. Yesterday we didn't go to Tlatelolco nor the Zocalo because I felt asleep. We planned of getting up early and going there before visiting the first room of the day.

I have just sent the message asking for it. Saying that I want it, I'm sure.

We woke up when her alarm of the phone sounded. She was really tired, so she asked me if we could sleep some more. I totally agreed. The breakfast was from here, the restaurant of the hotel. I got... I don't remember what I was typing. I just received the message confirming the room. Just tomorrow I make the deposit and can take the room. It's a weird feeling, having now somewhere to stay. It's a huge relief and yet it's some kind of despair realizing that I don't have to return anymore.

I dressed with the intention of looking feminine but I guess my choice of clothes wasn't that obvious. After breakfast we took the subway, the first time we did use the first wagon that is reserved for woman. We got to Copilco, outside the metro station I called the woman that I had chatted with but nobody answered. We went straight to there. We got to the street and finally the house. Last night we looked for it on Google Maps and the street view showed us a green house of two flights. We got there but there was nobody to be seen. I sent another message but it stayed unlooked. I knocked on the garage door first and waited for a quarter of an hour, then a second time minutes before the time we had said we would leave.

I don't remember how was it that we decided to keep looking on the numbers of the houses down the street. It was half an hour after the agreed time. We found a house with a repeated number and the letters "bis". We kept going and my phone rang. Just moments later did we find some women outside a house that seemed to recognize why we were there.

They showed us the room. The mother, the one actually named Rosa, welcomed us and gave us a tour of the building. Before leaving, she added that "and about what you told my daughter, you don't have nothing to worry about here." She commented about the couple that lives with her daughter. We left.

From there we took the subway to Coyoacan and walked towards the Frida Kahlo's Museum. There was a line that got to the end of the street, but that was the one for the people that already had a printed ticket or bought. Catherine was discouraged of going and talked about returning. I convinced her of staying... well, she says that I told her that if she wanted togo, go... Anyway, we stood on the other lane that got to the end of the street and then came back. The end was almost to the same place that it began. A couple of minutes later she had the idea of buying the tickets over the internet in her phone. We used my debit card and it was a success.

Half an hour later we were in. We took some pictures and I posted one of them on Facebook.

There was time still before going to visit the second room, so we went to a little faire that was in a park nearby. I bought a quartz with a painting on it of the tree of Life. "Wherever you are, I'll be; wherever you go, I'll go; wherever you die, I'll die."

I think about giving it to her for her birthday tomorrow. We've made some different plans that even now I don't know what will happen.

We stopped at a coffee place and drank tea. The other room was real nice and clean. The potential roommate interviewed me right then and there and we seemed to click it off nicely.

After visiting the Zocalo and eating dinner her, I decided to sent a message to confirm the room.

And it's all done. Tomorrow I'll make the deposit and everything will be set.

I'll finally be moving officially here.

## 2017-02-06

Catherine is my age now. Today is her birthday. We woke up un the morning and I used the phone to ask for breakfast. I ordered her some pancakes with fruit, and for me scrambled eggs with bacon. The restaurant was barely opening so they told us beforehand that the order would take a while. We used the time to fool around, kissing each other and exploring under the pijamas. When she got into the bathroom they called us for a third time after telling that they didn't had any grapefruit. This time the waiter asked us if we were there, because they had sent the food but nobody answered. I told him that we hadn't heard anything. He sent her again. This time I left the door opened. Cathy didn't like her pancakes. We showered and got ready. This time I wore something more feminine and still I felt like people would see me suspiciously. It's weird, I see pictures of myself and I looked more different than the past months of my transition.

Yesterday was when a kid selling and offering something approached us outside the Museum of Frida Kahlo, and told us "Take it girl... girl, boy, I don't know".

First we went to the Vasconcelos library. We used the metro to get there. It supposedly would be open, but it was not.

No, that wasn't the first thing. Yesterday I sent a message confirming the rent of my room. Before going down the station we looked for an ATM and I made a withdraw. I took enough money to pay for the deposit and the first month of rent. There was an oxxo further down the street so I deposited the money and sent a picture of the receipt.

I officially have where to stay and sleep. Tomorrow is the last full day I'll share with Catherine. The night after tomorrow will be the last one for a while.

When we returned from the closed library, I asked Catherine to stop by the metro-bus station to see if I could buy another card. I was introducing the money when the couple next to us asked us for help. She had put in 15 pesos, but the machine didn't give her nothing in return but a receipt. I showed them how you pushed the button and just introduce the coins, it would be more than 16, but the card only costs 10, the rest is its funds. The machine threw me mine, and I exchanged it to her for her bill of 20 pesos. Catherine showed her hoy to refill it.

Her husband told her to thank the "young man... lady" he corrected himself as Catherine pointed out. People here have been accepting, but, does this mean that they see me and know I'm trans? Do policemen cloak me at the entrance of the exclusive wagon and just let me pass?

From the library we went to Tlatelolco. We stopped by the arqueological zone and saw the building where I'll be taking my other entry exam in a couple of weeks. We sat by the Plaza de las 3 Culturas. There was a plaque with the names of some of the dead students that were killed in the massacre of the 68th. Both of us felt a knot in our throats. I mentioned my interest of visiting the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires.

In there I told my family and friends that I've found a room. I chatted a little with my parents and L. My mom later sent me pictures of Nymeria looking out the window. I miss her more than I ever think I would.

We came to the Zocalo, the Main Plaza of the city. We ate tacos de canasta and shared a torta of wienner sausages. We kept going t the Latinamerican tower and saw the Bellas Artes Palace. Both of them were also closed.

In the Hotel, as we returned after the trip, we lied on the bed to rest. Catherine had her period. We fooled around without getting under the clothes. But I mentioned I was sleepy and it killed the mood. She were distant. "Every time that I start things you get either tired or sleepy".

I resented her, because I was angry at myself. She took my bra off, she left me in a tank, cold and she was the one that stopped. I made a comment, but she stopped. I used that excuse to turn around. Then I fell asleep.

We had made a reservation in a restaurant with a view to the Zocalo. We changed and went. We had an entree of avocado and tuna, beer in a cocktail with clamato, our main plates were arrachera steak for her and meatballs in a chipotle sauce for me. We took a shot of tequila for celebration and finished the evening with a corn bread with eggnog and vanilla ice cream.

We were talking about everything, the notebook that she bought yesterday and I said I would write something in it.

"I'll draw a picture of a dick in it, maybe the words "I love you" written with the little veins". She made a face and her eyes started watering. "I was going to tell you no, but I remember that you always used to draw me dicks."

She started crying. I asked her if it was a good or a bad kind of cry. "A little bit of both". "I think about it, and you'll stay here". I cried with her. Two girls in a romantic dinner sobbing before the main dishes came.

Maybe neither of us want to think about it. We had a full day still. I don't know how I'll deal with letting her board the plane.

This will be the last night that I'll share with someone I know before sleeping in a stranger's bed. In less than 24 hours I will leave Catherine in the airport and return to my new room. I live here now. I've paid the deposit and the first month of rent.

We've done...

I don't know what I was typing. I'm here lying on the bed and Catherine is sitting on the other one. Her tablet is streaming an episode of House. The one where the patient is paralyzed and can't move. He can't do anything but blink. Then he can't even do that. I remember seeing those episodes of House weekly when they were showing on air tv. I used to wait every day the were playing to catch them on the time they aired. I maybe was in jr high. Now that I am seeing it again, I can feel the emotions related to it. The frustration of not being able to communicate, the loneliness and despair. The feeling of hopelessness.

The first thing we did today was eat breakfast at the restaurant that is a block down the street. I ordered northern eggs, scrambled eggs with stranded meat bathed in green sauce and Catherine ordered scrambled eggs with sausages.

We returned and ordered a uber to take us to my new room. The next time that I enter in there I'll be alone in this monstrous city.

I broke the handle of my suitcase. The first flight of stairs was easy, the second, not even with her help could we take it without issues. When the landlady saw us with the case, she said: "This girl brought her whole closet in wheels". Catherine told me to bring the large suitcase. She's flipping me off as I read out loud what I am typing.

From there we walked towards the metro station in Copilco, looking around seeing all the little shops and tailors and beauty shops and inns and butchers around the area, my future neighborhood. We intercepted the microbus I could be able to take when I am in a rush to get into the university or to the metro station.

We traveled towards Chapultepec to visit the Forest. In there, was saw the lake and the little stands with souvenirs and bags and clothes. Both Catherine and I bought each a bag. Mine fits my laptop perfectly and I can use it as a big purse. Catherine's looks more like a backpack, but it's small enough to be used as a purse as well. She told she has always wanted something like that since for ever, but never really found one that fulfilled her wishes.

We visited the Chapultepec castle, now the national museum of history. Catherine bought me both a dreamcatcher to put over my bed as the one I gave to her from my trip to Guadalajara with my parents. She also bought for me a jewelry box. A little wooden jewelry box with a carved cover.

Exhausted we walked down the castle and another blocks looking for a place to eat. I chose a restaurant from google maps because of its name. It is called Mexsi bocu, a play with the pronunciation of Thank you in french and the mexican language. I thought it would be a corny little funny place, and it end up being a fancy french restaurant with plates way over our budget. Catherine ordered a tartar steak and I a roast beef sandwich. We were overblown by the tastefulness of their home bread.

After our dinner we walked a little more and stayed in a homey cafe sharing a frappe of chai tea.

Tomorrow is Catherine's departure. She's deciding what to wear tomorrow. I had to before we left today because I would take the rest of my clothes to the new room.

We're sitting on the bed, she's by my side. We were just talking about my money situation. I came here with 1200 pesos and 4000 in cash. Now I'm left with less than that and a month paid of rent. I have 6600 pesos in both cash and funds. My father deposited me a thousand pesos. Is it enough money? Am I still being dependent of them?

That was never the idea. Even when I lived with them my father used to give me half a thousand every week and my mother a thousand every month.

They can still help me. Not because they send me money does it mean I'm a failure.

Does it?

It feels extremely weird changing the location in Google Maps of "Home". In the app citymapper, I had the hotel as the "home" reference. I didn't want to change that, but i's the most useful app here, so I did.

Now, I already showered and am lying on this my new bed. I'm tired. It's barely 8 o'clock. I want to sleep. I feel like crying. Since yesterday I have lost count of the times I've cried.

At what time did I finished the words yesterday?

Later that night, we were both on the bed and got intimate. I don't really remember how it started. We kissed and caressed each other. We moved it to the bathroom and continued rinsing our bodies. She asked me to lie down on the floor. She did and I sat besides her. I touched her and made her come. There were red spots on my finger, she was ashamed. It's the first time that I've seen her menstrual blood.

I don't and won't have any, ever.

Just now I feel like crying again. Is it the hormones or the feeling alone in a huge city or the pictures of Nymeria that my family keeps sending me on Whatsapp.

This would be like the fifth time today.

I hear voices outside of the flatmates. They are all women, the ad asked exclusively to young ladies. Maybe that has something to do as well. I feel scared of going outside, I feel vulnerable. They are like 5. Will they accept me or see me as one?

Catherine cried when she read the page I wrote for her in the notebook she bought. Yesterday she wrote one for me in the notebook she gave me. I haven't read it. I'm a little scared.

We woke up early today. She asked me to stay asleep and in bed. Before I went to the shower she touched me and pleasured me. The orgasms I experience are way different.

We got ready and checked out of the hotel. Did we ask for an uber or did we take the metro? No, we used the metro. We walked here and I came up to leave my backpack and bag and then returned downstairs with her.

No, we didn't take the metro, we used an uber, but why? We told him to continue the street until the end. No, no, that was before, when I brought the big suitcase. This time we did use the metro while I had my backpack and the bag. Again we used the women only wagons and nobody said a thing.

From here we walked to the metro and returned to the hotel, but instead of getting in, we came down the Museum of Bellas Artes and walked to the Latinamerican tower. We made several stops in different shops and didn't even climbed the tower.

We ate outside the metro, an order of 5 tacos and half of another each.

The walk from Bellas Artes to the hotel, took us time enough to pick up her suitcase and order a uber to the airport. She did her check in and dropped her bag. We went to wings and ordered a soup each and some fries. We chatted and laughed. Did we cry there? Yes, a little.

From there we stopped at the bathroom. It was way too embarrassing for me and she does not know what happened. We waited in line to use the toilet. Two people were occupying two of the four stalls, the third was being cleaned and the fourth was the one who kept getting vacant and occupied. Catherine went and the cleaning lady finished with the stall and invited me in. I sat and peed. I shat, too. I had no intention of doing it, but it happened. I sat up and looked for the mechanism, the button or stick or whatever to flush. I thought it was a motion sensor. I put down the lid and as I walked out I heard a flushing sound assuming that it was mine.

When I got out, another lady got in. I was washing my hands when the stall opened and the lady asked how to flush it. I felt my face reddening and wanted to get swallowed by the earth.

I waited with Catherine for a little while outside the entrance of security. We cried there just as we did last night when we hugged. Just as I am doing right now.

I took the metro alone for the first time here. In Copilco I went to the other side to Walmart instead of coming directly here. The walk is a kilometer approximately. I bought groceries, 600 hundred pesos worth of groceries and walked back with them a kilometer and a half with what easily could had been 4 or 5 kilos of stuff.

I have some things to do, Paola gave us some stuff to do with the work for the association. I could do it now, but I guess I will wait until tomorrow in the library.

I might take Catherine's advice and go to the library. It might be good being outside and not hiding in this room.

## 2017-02-10

It seems that I forgot to do my words yesterday. I've been getting accustomed to the city life. I used to live in a city before as well. But the size is way different. How big is this city? It's not about its size, it's its population. I am always surrounded by people. Even in this house, in just this floor, there are easily other 6 girls, maybe more.

The washing machine is not working, it won't be fixed until next wednesday. The landlady offered to take my dirty clothes to her sister's laundry. I accepted. Just today I left the plastic bag of my clothes downstairs next to the washing machine.

This morning I slept and slept. I didn't want to get up. Now is more correct the expression getting down. My bed is sustained over the floor, I have to climb down a set of steps. A wooden-made ladder of four steps, where the second is loose. The sound of the mrs asking if she could clean the rooms. I got down in a hurry and made myself look presentable. She didn't knock on my door.

Yesterday I had planned on going to the bank or taking my pictures for the certificate of the english language I have to approve if I pass the first round of testing to the psych master. I did both. I showered and wore the white blouse that I bought yesterday at wal-mart.

I took a plastic bag with my shaving soap, brush, and razor and wrapped it around the towel. Since a couple of days ago I started going to the shower without any underwear. I can easily put the clothes over the door and put them on again after I finish. Then, I think it was yesterday, I saw one of the girls getting out of her room with a towel wrapped around her waist and a blouse on top. Maybe I could do that. It is easier to keep the towel over just half of my body than completely.

I have two days to write about and I can't even reach half of today's quota.

Yesterday I did study. I took the red notebook and wrote in it. I read about scientific notation and logarithms. It was more exciting than making the plan of the workshop for the trans ladies.

Just now I was texting Catherine how I wish I could start the process of changing my birth certificate. The only thing that I have left is the prove of home address. I guess it's not really necessary to have my ID stating my home here as well.

I read a post about a Baja Californian man who did the procedure with the T-squad, the association that offered the apartment. I could contact them if there's any issue with the prove of address.

The plan is to start it after doing the other exam.

I have to inscribe myself into the language one. I needed to pay for it in the bank. I did it. After I showered I left and walked south to the university, looking for a place to print the bank order. I guessed there could be something inside the campus, but I didn't find it. I went to UNAM store.

When I showered, the razor slipped and broke. I don't have my double edged razor anymore. How could I shave? I went to my room and shave my face with some moisturizing cream. The results were acceptable. I put some little make up to hide the shadow. In the mart I bought a spray for my feet and shaving cream and salt. There was a bank inside but I decided against getting in without the printed order.

Outside, before taking the metro I got to a picture place. The man gendered me female. I guess. He addressed me as a girl. But now that I think about it, when he asked for a name and heard mine he made a sound and a face as in confirming a theory.

Here I don't know if people address me as a female because I am seen as one or because of politeness.

I walked to Wal-mart again, but this time I went to the bank. Inside, the man who gives you the ticket told me that for the deposit I could ask his partner to help me. I told him that the paper clearly stated that it wasn't accepted the atms, but he insisted. I waited and finally the lady that helped me agreed with me.

I made the deposit, the bank teller behind the window treated me nicely. She apologized after saying my name outloud. I don't know because she realized it was a man name or because she said my last name wrong.

I went to the library to study, but I don't think I'll do it again soon.

## 2017-02-11

Days keep going as fast as ever. They are way faster. It's been more than a week since I came here. This will be my second weekend, my first one alone. I didn't realize it until yesterday when I asked at the photo center their open hours and he specified for the weekend. It's just a couple of days that I've been renting here. Yesterday I left the plastic bag for the mrs downstairs. Late in the evening I saw it still. I kept studying after returning from the failed attempt at the library.

I woke up with the explicit intention of spending most of the day studying. I prepared myself breakfast, using the stove for the first time. I scrambled two eggs with tomato and onions. Was it before or after showering? I shower and put on the long sleeved blue shirt. I know it looks masculine, but I put it on on purpose. That way I could avoid going out and spending any more money. It didn't work. There wasn't no cups for coffee nor tea here. They have drunk but I guess each have their own.

In the shower the mrs showed a room to a girl with a man. The young woman asked questions, the mrs answered them, there are a couple of girls here, some study veterinary, others psychology, she thinks. "So there are only women, then?" "Yeah..." Meanwhile I was naked in the shower cubicle trying to shave my beard with a disposable razor.

So I put on my purse without any makeup and went downstairs. There was Rosa there, the mrs, she wanted to tell me something.

First, when I slide the door one of the wood pieces fell and made a sound. "What happened?" ... "There was a sound as if something had fallen". I said nothing. Then she told me... The bag of clothes. Don't I have more? There are just so little. It wouldn't be enough for a single load. Something about the many liters of water that are used, and then again after rinsing.

"No se si te puedes esperar a traer unos dos pantalones mas, no seas malito..." Did she notice my face? Did I make any? Did I notice it or it was her reaction that reassured me? She hit lightly her forehead and apologized. "I have to get used to it".

Used to what? The only time she has seen me as a man or even known my name is in the picture of the id I gave her.

I took the opportunity and asked her about proof of address. She told me there was a mailbox next to the washing board outside with different bills by the names of her, her husband and her daughter. I could grab and use any of them.

"There is something, though. The names don't match." She reassured me that the girls, or people in general have used them without having any issues "it's just for the university".

"But that is it, this doesn't have to do with the university but with the civil registry"

She told me to just say that I'm staying with some friends, but I know it won't do it.

I just went outside and walked to Wal-mart, again, to buy a cup. In there I bought chorizo, too, and on my way back a kilo of tortillas. I ate that as a meal, potatoes with chorizo and two of them. It's weird. When I lived alone years ago, tortillas were a prized possession. Now they are some of the cheapest foods I can get.

Returning she told me that she had taken my clothes with some sheets. I hung them outside.

I've been studying. I have reviewed a little more than half of the themes. Most of them are things I already know, so it's not a fair metric.

I knew about the proof of address. So I sent the message again. This time I got a better and more complete answer. She gave me her number. I called her. Her voice took me by surprise. In her pictures I even doubted she were trans herself.

She told me that there is no problem if the proof of address has a different name than mine. I just need a copy of their id and a simple letter stating that the person is renting me: "put that they've been doing it for the last three months", and that would be it. Doing it with her I won't need an appointment. The process will take around two hours and by the end of it I'll be leaving with my pre-certificate.

Two weeks later, I can pick up the real thing.

Will they accept giving me a copy of id?


## 2017-02-13

I keep studying. The themes keep getting fewer and shorter. This might not be such an impossible test after all. Now I am lying over my bed with the laptop where the pillow should be. Studying gets tiring.

I made myself breakfast, eggs with tortilla pieces and tomato. For eating I made myself a sandwich and a bag of instant soup. I've been getting nervous about the food. I don't really get why. I guess I have enough for maybe this week. Easily for half of it. Money is not an issue either. My dad sent me another email where he deposited 1000 pesos in my account. When I checked the account online, it seemed that I have more than 6 thousand. The balance was of 5 but had another thousand in the frozen balance. Later it would adjust with the withdraws I did these week, but still, it's more than I thought I had.

I can go to Wal mart and get some more food. I have bought every of the non consumable items I need. My suitcase will do for a basket of dirty laundry. This week I have nothing to do but get ready for the test of next monday.

That's not true. I had an appointment today. I was supposed to get in Skype and attend the meeting with the girls of the association. I was all done and ready, but it was postponed because Rubi, the director, is sick and had to left for home.

Tomorrow at 3pm in pacific time.

6 days of studying and I will go to make that exam.

I sent a text message to my dr, the endocrinologist. Two or three weeks ago I checked my T levels and awaited for the setting of the next appointment. Time passed and I'm here. I don't know when does he expects to see me. I don't know when will I return. In the text I remind him that I don't know when will the next appointment be and that I am already in the capital. So I wish when to expect it so I can organize my time.

I don't know if he answered. I sent it around noon. The last time I checked it was still unanswered.

I opened Facebook and thought about posting the picture of Nymi looking out of the front window. I typed the perfect description, an open letter to her: Nymi, yes, that's my car but I'm not home. I don't know how to explain to you that I won't be coming tonight.

I didn't post it and yet I had tears running down my face.

I miss her a lot.

There was a post in Facebook today, in the group of Trans people. Someone gave advice to anyone just to do the process of change of papers. If the address in the id is not the same of the one in the proof of address, then the owner of the house has to make a letter stating that the person does live there and adjunct a copy of their id.

It's kind of what Daniela told me over the phone. It should be easier. It's a simpler reason of explaining. Why am I still nervous?

It's just asking. I won't loose anything. Even if they say they can't, I can contact the other association. There are still options.

I don't know what has happened with L.

I don't remember the day that was mentioned for their family session. How was it? How will it be, if it hasn't happened?

Are they feeling alone? Do they miss me?

Do all of my family?

My mother mentioned the other time how my grandma got up to made me breakfast. It was a fun bittersweet intention what drove my mom to share it, but it left a sour taste in both our mouths, Catherine and mine.

I should be getting down from the bed and continue with the studying session. I'm half over biology and just to start bio-chemistry. After both of those is familiar and known territory.

One week before the test. The day after tomorrow I can choose a group and date for taking the other test of english. Then it would be just wait until the second week of March, and either do the second test or wait for the last few days to the last news.

How much will I stay here? Maybe I won't pass neither of the tests and after finishing the procedure I can get back home. Maybe the dr asks me to return to see him and adjust the dosage. Maybe I pass both of the tests and have to stay here until the start of the semester.

I don't know.

First I should get the courage to go downstairs and ask for that proof and a copy of id and signature.

I don't remember if I did yesterday's words...
 It's weird, I have more time than ever. Justo today I finished both the new episodes I downloaded of the TV series I binged in Netflix and the themes of the guide for the test of the master.

Yesterday the woman didn't returned much call. I sent her a text to call me, but she didn't. Today I expected both her answer and the endocrinologist. Neither of them.

Catherine doesn't have a phone either. The screen of her iPhone is not responding so we're burdened to talk on Facebook.

It was yesterday that I sent a friend request to Zuri. The girl I had a crush on in middle school. I remember the weird sensation of both remembering my naive infatuation of yeas before, and being really happy in a relationship with another girl while she sent me a message to tell me that she had just thought about the gift I sent her and how I called her princess.

Not much later, she got a boyfriend or the one she had became serious. And then, some time later, she got pregnant.

I don't really know the reason why I sent her the request. Did I want her to accept me? Was I expecting her to recognize me?

When I asked the landlady for the papers she kept misgendering me. When I went outside to ask for the copies, I felt the people's eyes on me as I walked.

I feel vulnerable and alone. I feel tiny in this huge city.

I'm surrounded of people. Thousands, millions of them who pass me by, and glance at my body or face.

Catherine told me to give the woman today to call back. Tomorrow I could call her again.

I thought of when I called her. She was busy and just told me to meet her at Salto del agua the next day. What?

She confused me with somebody else.

Today I sent her a message through Facebook. She saw it almost immediately. She told me to call her. I did.

I'll meet her the day after tomorrow at 9 and a half. "we have to be there early because that's the time the lady that helps us gets in. We should get all the papers in order before the judge arrives, she's the one that lets me pass all of you without an appointment."

I am both excited and terrified. This is why I came here. I'm going to do what at some time I saw so so far away. I even kind of see it as a reward after getting into the master program. I'll be doing it before even doing the first test.

They will probably keep my ID. The people at the university ask for a legal ID at the entrance. Fortunately u brought my passport. I have short hair and a shade of black beard. I look nothing like that.

I hope there won't be any problem. This time I won't have Catherine by my side.

Should I tell my parents or wait until I have the pre-certificate? Why don't I want to mention it? Of what am I scared?

My mom sent me a text today, calling me sofy and asking how I've been. I told her good and studying. It might had sounded rude, but I honestly haven't done anything else.

I chatted a little with two of the girls. One, Lucy, the one that touched my hair because it was pretty, is studying anthropology at the University. She is starting.

The other, one of the group of girls, Sinaid, I think is how she's called, is doing her internship at an animal's hospital. They are veterinaries. They have a month here and will stay just two more.

She did mention my accent. I do sound different. Should I assume that they know about me?

Today I neither shaved nor showered. It might be the symptoms of depression or just the trying of not dirtying more clothes.

Tomorrow I will go for groceries and to get the copies I lack.

Friday I'll go to the civil registry, Monday I have to get up even more early to leave for my test. Tuesday I will have to have finished the project of the association because is the potential day of giving the program. I told them I could be online but I really wish I won't be able to.

I like working for them, being a volunteer. Maybe being a teacher is not what I'm best for.

It's been months since the last time I wrote in here. I stopped altogether when I continued forgetting about coming back here to type and record. How much has it been? I was already in Mexico city. Right now I am sitting in the black chair that my father bought for me in one of my birthdays. It's a month and a half before the start of the new semester, the new stage of my life.

Today I was supposed to get up in the morning to see the live webcast of the informative session to the grad school accepted students.

Did the last time I wrote in here was before my first return to hometown? I have both my birth certificate and official id. In one of the reunions with the psych team of work, an acquaintance of Ruby asked me what was my next step of transition. "What is next for you?"

It wasn't until then that I realized I'm finished with my transition. I could go to some more sessions of laser so that I don't have to worry about the hairs on my chin, or wait until the second year of HRT is over and the changes are all set. But this is it. I am done.

Is this just something that I got an urge to pick back up or is deep down the intention to actually keep with it.

What was it that brought me to this?

I am typing these words on the external keyboard connected to the laptop. I bought a different one after letting mine to Miguel. It's a mechanical keyboard with the clanky keys that made that sound that I used to hear in the television programs of when I was a child. They keys are all blank. There is no use anymore to lower my glance.

Is this it? Do I want to have something to write so I can use the keyboard?

No.

This morning after returning to sleep after there was no webcast, I dreamed with both Anna and Melisa. We were in a different town, being hosted by some aunt from my father's side of the family. It's been weird in my last dreams. I don't notice my gender. I don't really know what I was when I wake up. In this last one I know I was myself because I remember a feeling of not being able to carry all my stuff. I had a backpack with me and my purse and a phone and some other stuff.

The night before I had a dream with my ex. I didn't mention it to Catherine. It's moments like these that made me think I don't really have anyone besides her. I do, but, it's not the same.

It was a sure thing that Catherine would come with me to the city. We were even looking for rooms to share or a flat. Then her doubts came back. Now it's a limbo. I am both hopeful and grieving. I both miss her and resent her.

A couple of dates ago we kissed and I could feel the passion and emotion behind her lips. It was as if my movements controlled her inner feelings. I felt a master of her desire. And just then at the moment of that realization I stopped. How could she be kissing me when in a couple of days we will part ways and stay separated because of her choice?

Now I know for sure that the father of my ex knows about me.

I was outside the woman's bathroom in the faculty watching the purse and bags of Paola when I saw the Dr Gonzales walking down the stairs. Who saw whom first? One smiled and the other waved. He approached me with a confession that he did not recognize me. He asked how I've been doing. By then I already knew that I got accepted to the master in neurobiology.

I purposefully told him to give my regards to her family. Weeks later I saw him again in the conference of the research I participated with in COLEF.

In the dream I had with her daughter, I was friends with her. Again the same idea of knowing that after nothing we had come back to peace. I knew it was a dream. I knew it was not real. I had all the intention of using every minute of it. It's not the first. Am I worried that it won't be the last?

Today I got into my mother's bedroom and saw her ipad on her bed. I grabbed it and opened it. I logged into her facebook and saw the ex's profile. I looked through her last updates and pictures. What she has been up to. She can know about me seeing my mother's posts. Does she?

I finished and had this weird melancholy accompanying me for the rest of the day. She seems happy with her partner. For an instant I thought about writing how I am happy for her, but I decided against it. Is not that I don't feel it, but, why should it care?

I long for a friendship that may have never really been. I saw my reflection in the mirror after logging out.

In less than I week I'l be leaving this town for good. Wednesday. Wednesday I'll leave for the rest of the year.

Am I scared? I am numb.

Exhausted.

## 2017-06-16

Sometime happened today that I never would had imagined.

I had the alarm clock but postponed it several times due to tiredness. Catherine would come pick me up around 2 in the afternoon. It was half an hour before noon. The shorts and underwear were all set up in my desk just for taking them and carrying with me to the bathroom.

Yesterday the plan was set. Catherine would come pick us up with her dog and we'd buy something on the way to the beach. Maybe a pizza and a six-pack of beer. The fantasy and memory of me running through the sand with Nymeria was something that would never fail to draw a smile on my face.

This would be an inexpensive date before tomorrow's night out. The night was postponed since the week before that I was hit by a stomach flu and nausea. I went upstairs and brushed my teeth. There was nothing weird. I sat on the toilet and noticed a small brown dot in the bottoms of my underpants. I was disgusted so I took them off and put them away. I ran the water. The droplets took their time to get hot.

I would wear short shorts today so I shaved my legs just after putting on shampoo. I shaved my pits and chest. I put on conditioner. It was around then that I felt nauseous. Would the symptoms come again? I remember that other time when I had to grab the upper part of the glass door. I was light headed but didn't realize it. Then, in a flash I remember being on the floor and the metalic taste of blood inside my mouth. I passed my finger through my lips and checked the color of it coming out. Because of the mist from the cold water I didn't realized that my vision was blurred.

I shut the water and stood there for a moment. I stepped out and everything was whiten out. Like a blank cloth that covered my view. Million things ran through my head. Could it be an aneurysm? Maybe an ischemic infart or a tumor. The vision came back and the reflection in the mirror was clear.

One of my front teeth and a lateral one were chipped and broken. Then reality hit me. I passed out. I fainted in the shower. I could had died. There was some kind of irritation when I thought it was just the nausea that I would have to cancel our plans again.

I stepped down with still my pajamas and my hair al wet. I didn't even shave. Catherine had send me some messages asking if I was still asleep. I called her but she turned the call off. Maybe she thought it was a mistake. I tried again.

I was crying and my voice shaken with fear. I told her what had happened and that I was scared. Was I alone? Miguel was in his room when I got in the shower. I remember that. I didn't want to say anything. What could he do anyway?

I called my mom with the same fear in my voice and asked her what to do. She told me that there was the option of making an appointment with the dentist. She could pick me up as soon as possible. She took the care to inform my dad.

I was misgendered twice today. First it was him when we were waiting in the dentist office. The other one was the dentist when he finished the work and told his assistant to pass the mirror to me so I could see myself. He asked me what was my name mid session. Maybe it had to do with that as well. He apologized, though.

I asked my mom to bring me back home to shave before going to the doctor. There was a lot of traffic so it was impossible. I ended up buying two packs of jello, a small bottle of water, a sports drink and a two razor pack and did the job on the way.

I didn't want to have to deal with awkward questions.

He checked me. He was really nice. I still don't know if he realized I am trans. I didn't hide it but I didn't tell either. I asked about my medication without saying what they were for. He's a doctor, though. It might have been obvious. He gave me an order for studies and we will go tomorrow morning. He marked Female sex and order for the female one.

Should I had corrected him? Will it cause any problem tomorrow?
