_You? Are you still in burnout/mayhem mode?_

I noticed that I would mostly write in this journal about women.
Women I dated or women I wanted to date.
I think back to last year and realize that, most probably,
the last entry was about my night with the French Girl.
If I am mistaken, I won't have any record of her name.
Last year I deleted my Tinder account where I could find our conversation.

Sonny is lying down on my bed.
She is still a bit hungover from being out last night.
We went to _Bon Délire_ with Alda and Aliza to celebrate the news that I was
awarded the Alfonso Caso medal for my master's.
She still has two weeks left before she flies back to _México_.

I told her I would not talk again—or at least for the rest of the night—about
_ph_, the _girl with the cat_.
Were I to do it, I'd let her grab my breasts without reprimands.

It was hard.
Maybe that's why I decided to come out of bed and grabbed my laptop to write
it here.

I feel uncomfortable with the idea of continuing to think about her.
That while she ruminates in my mind,
my texts stay unreplied—or unseen, even—in her phone.

I met her last month, last year.
I had taken out the fact of my transness from my hinge profile,
rendering it more active.
I sent her a comment about how I liked her name and she matched me almost
immediately, apparently, the joke flying over her head.

For some reason, instead of ignoring her text for, at least, a couple of
hours, I acknowledged her and let a conversation blossom.
There was something different in our exchange that escapes description.
We chatted for a couple of days and Sunday she asked me out for drinks.

I was excited but a little nervous about the idea.
Not much before, another girl had asked me out and I cancelled her because
I felt overwhelmed by the idea of getting rejected by the end of our date.
I accepted Sophie but warned her that most of my week's afternoons were taken
by my French classes.
Friday I would be flying out to _México_ for the holidays.
She would test again and, were she negative, we could go out some time before
my departure on Friday.
If not, we could wait for the new year.
She accompanied her goodbye confirming that she'd update me the next day.

Tuesday we settled for the next day's _5 à 7_, before her planned concert.
We met at _station Saint Laurent_ with the plan to look for a bar around the
venue of her concert.
We ended up at _Bar Pamplemousse_.
We ordered a pint of beers each but I can't remember if we got a second.
Perhaps she got a cocktail.
We talked about McGill, Cuba, and _La chupitería_.
She apologized about the briefness of our date and let me know that she
was enjoying my company and would certainly wish to do it again.
Maybe when I came back from my trips we could meet again for a longer night.
I thought about the many times that I have heard that lie from other mouths
and I did not fully believe her.

Did I think about kissing her?

I walked her to her venue.
She called her friend.
We hugged good-bye.

Later that night, I got a text from her.

"Hey! I had a lovely time", she added a blue heart,
"Safe travels back home & to Cuba!"

I replied back reassuring her that not only was she not out of her game,
but it had been one of the best dates I had had.
I wished her _Happy holidays_.
She echoed my wishes and we did not talk while I spent my Christmas with my
family in Baja California, or new year's eve party in a disco inside a cave in
Trinidad, or my birthday in Manhattan.

I broke our silence on the evening of my arrival to "Montréal".

_Omg hi_, was the prefix to her Happy new year wishes.
We picked it up right where we had left it.
Not many messages and not many days later, she asked me out again for a second
date where I could tell her all of my stories over a meal.
We settled on _L'Espace Public_ for the weekend.

The Saturday's morning I texted her asking her for the time she wanted to meet.
Sonny and I went to do laundry.
I grabbed _Flowers for Algernon_ from the small library inside the _buanderette_.
When our clothes were all dry and folded,
we decided to grab brunch at _L'oufrier_ across the street.
At the table waiting for our food,
still carrying the uncertainty of an unreplied text,
I asked Sonny if she thought I'd meet her.
She got it right when she said no.

At 14h43 Sophie apologized and explained that her chronic pain condition had
flared rendering her bed-ridden.
I told her I understood.

I debated the idea of still going out.
In my conversation with Tirza, where I had mentioned my odyssey of escaping
Varadero, I brought up the idea of meeting that same night,
given that it had recently been freed up.
Unfortunately, she was just leaving on a ski trip,
otherwise she would have definitely accepted.
_Maybe next week?_

Not much later Sophie apologized again and reassured me she was looking forward
to seeing me; as soon as she felt better she would look forward to catch up.
Instead of a point, she ended her message with a red heart.

Next day I asked her how she was doing.
While I had never had experienced with chronic pain,
I was familiar to the idea of cancelling plans due to not being able to get
out of bed.
I confessed that I was also excited to meet her.

On Monday, she replied saying she was feeling better, though still a little groggy.
She asked how my week looked.
This term on French my classes, while online, still take most of my week.
I had tentatively offered either Thursday or Friday to meet with Tirza.
Saturday I had invited my friends to _Dieu du ciel!_ to celebrate my birthday.

Wednesday, she resurfaced sharing that she was currently on a leave from
work—thus my proposition of going for lunch somewhere close to work was a
no-go—but could tell me all about her end-of-year burnout moment when we met,
and proposed a Sunday brunch.
I offered the idea of meeting her at one of the two brunch places I knew
around my neighborhood.
One of them the one I went to on my last french date.
The date with the girl who worked on movies and who insisted I text her so we
could meet again, just to later reject me saying that she had not felt a real
connection and thus did not see it moving anywhere.

She agreed.

"How much of a morning person are you?", I asked her,
"I have the advantage of closeness, so you can pick the time."

"Hmm, I'm going to be totally up front and say that I am not the MOST
mornings of morning people, but I can commit to like a 10h30 Sunday event
for sure."

Friday, I met Tirza after having dinner with Sonny at _Arepera_ and a pint at
_Bifteck_.
During dinner, Tirza texted me to confirm our meeting given that the sensation
of cold was around the -20°C.
A part of me hoped she would cancel, but we met each other at "Réservoir".
The date ended with the very familiar _text me if you want to do this again_,
except that this time it was not me who said it.

Saturday I went with Alda and Sonny to have breakfast at _St Viateur_ and
look for clothes at some _friperies_ around the area.
We considered having some ramen at the place Tirza had recommended the night
before, but we headed straight to the _Brasserie_.

Sunday morning I woke up hungover.
I showered and put on the salmon sweatshirt that I had bought the night before.
The suggested plan was to had dinner at _Le toasteur_.
I remembered the morning I went there with that other québécoise girl
the wait time was over an hour.
I made a back up reservation at Mesón, at 11h.
Coincidentally, Aliza would also be at that same place at noon.
I arrived at _Le toasteur_ and wandered around the entrance,
hesitant of going in and asking for the wait time.
I wanted for her to arrive before I'd share my plans.
Would she be impressed by my thoughtfulness?
Except arrive she never did.

"In a devastating twist of events,
I literally just woke up to absolute mayhem & am currently trying to find an
emergency vet for my cat who is throwing up blood.
The universe is out to get me."

I immediately told her that I was sorry to hear that.
I don't think she got how sorry I was.
I offered to ask around for vets thinking of Aliza and Alda—neither of them
knew of any.
I walked to the café next door, ordered myself a latte,
and sat by the window with my phone in my hands.
I took a picture through the window of the bike across the street.
I thought back to the picture I took of the entrance by my apartment in
_des pins_ the day that Alexandra kissed me good-bye two times the last
day I ever saw her.

I sent a last message sharing with her the unfruitful results of my search,
redundantly telling her that there was no need to worry about the date,
and telling her how I just hoped that everything would turn out OK.

All of my messages stayed ignored/unseen until I broke my own promise of not
double-texting a woman I am fixated on again by asking her how her cat was
doing on the night of Tuesday.

Wednesday morning, she liked some of my messages as she tended to do all
throughout our conversation these past few weeks and updated me about her cat.
She sprinkled her text with another red heart.
She finished by acknowledging how understanding I have been.
Immediately after, she asked how I was doing.

Alda told me to wait a day before replying.
Instead, I threw at her four texts that same afternoon.
The first one said I was glad about her cat and how even my friends had asked
about her.
In the second one, I confessed that I had been a bit disappointed even though
I could not think of a better reason for cancelling.
I added the fact that I would have done the exact same thing had it been
Nymeria.
The third one was an update about me;
I had just finished the draft for the AAIC abstract for Philadelphia and had
gotten the unexpected news about the medal.
The fourth and final one was me throwing back the ball,
it was my failed attempt of moving the conversation forward,
it was the door that she left wide open after my invitation letting all the
coldness in instead.

These messages were not responded.
They were not liked.
They were possibly not even opened.
I keep fighting the urge to tell her how I am starting to regret not asking
to kiss her the night we met.

_Hey Kate, are you, uh, like going on a weekend trip to Ontario?_

### Monday, January 29th, 2024
_I don't think you should text her, also.
I know it's surprising coming from me.
It seems like she has some stuff in her life she has to figure out.
Give her some time.
I think she'll actually reply._

After finishing the words last night,
I went back a couple of months looking for Alexia's name.
On the way, I drifted another year and a half,
right up to December where I came back to _Montréal_ to this same situation
of mixed signals and manic-dependance but with a different face.
Two years ago almost to the day,
I tried to follow-up a series of encounters interrupted by a travel to
_México_ and receiving empty promises and long streaks of silences.

Months later I would think about how I would have done things differently if
I could have turn back time.
This is the chance to prove myself right.
Just let happen whatever has to happen.

At 1h I read from that point to the present.
I put down the soup that we had for dinner in the fridge and went back to bed.
I woke Sonny up and we talked about the past for a while.

A couple of hours later, the vibrations from the alarm in my watch woke me up.
I decided to get up and start the day.
I showered, brushed my teeth, brewed some coffee and left for the lab.

Before my French class we agreed on the plan for tomorrow.
I'll leave around the same time as today to work at the lab before my
appointment with Calli.
Sonny has her own session an hour before mine, which she will take home.
At the end of her therapy, she will join me around McGill campus and wait for
mine to finish.
We will then move to Thomson house to end the day there.
No.
I have to come back home around 17h to catch my class.
I hate having the classes online.
It makes it harder to concentrate on what is being taught and
participate actively on the exercises.

Last year, I started the classes offered by
_Le Ministère de l'Immigration, de la Francisation et de l´Integration_.
The evaluator that interviewed me on the phone to assess my level told me I
was halfway between level 2 and 3 before letting me choose which one I'd
prefer to join.
The former would bore me, but latter might be too challenging.
I am not sure on which I ended up.
I found it hard to follow through.
Those first weeks I went through the unfamiliar situation of feeling behind
the rest of the class.
In a bizarre way, it was refreshing not being ahead of everyone.

It didn't last long before I breezed through the grammar and let my
classmates behind.
Still I struggle to understand certain accents.
Most often than not, I try to carry my everyday life in _Montréal_
outside the university in French.

When I asked, they assured me that the financial aid would not be suspended.
I have still not received notification of the first deposit for this term.
The money is the only reason that I have not abandoned the course.
For the first time in a while, I know exactly what I want to talk about with
Calli.

Last night I shared with Sonny that I would cry when my aunts would leave
our house after a visit.
I remember once they proposed to my father to leave while I was away in a room,
to avoid whatever could happen.

I have looked at my phone today much fewer times than this past weekend.
A couple of months ago, in the middle of Fall,
Monica finally came to visit Montréal.
I went to pick her up at the airport as the start of her week-long stay.
Just like with Sonny two years ago and now, we did groceries,
watched movies on my couch, went out to restaurants and finish our day laying
down on the same bed chatting before falling asleep.

Unlike with Sonny,
there was an untrespassable barrier between us under the duvet.

_Staring is rude, you know?_

This past week, after spending a month together,
Sonny and I came to the agreement of make use of the time when the other one
is in the shower to masturbate.

With Monica I felt a similar unbearable urge that I could barely contain to the
moment of her departure, but instead of touching myself, I cut my thighs.

Last night I made the connection that I fear that, with Sophie,
if I don't send a message the conversation will wither just as Monica's did
after her stay.

### Tuesday, January 30th, 2024

_I don't think this is over;
I'm not saying she's going to reply—I can't know that—,
but I really don't think your story with Sophie has come to an end._

It's four in the morning.
Last night I asked Sonny to watch a movie that would make me cry.
We looked for one online—we searched on google,
asked chatGPT,
browsed the internet and our memories—, and we settled on _About time_.

It was around 22h, but the effect of my pills and the sadness that had been
brewing in me all day were too strong.
I finished my half of the beer and asked her to go back to bed.

Yesterday I woke up early—not this early—and went to the lab.
I would have therapy that afternoon and the plan was that Sonny would join me
after hers.
I left the house around 8h.
This time, I decided against buying a croissant.
My coffee was my whole breakfast.
I worked all morning on the response to reviewers from my first paper.
I am frustrated with it.
I want to get it over.

At 13h, I grabbed my stuff and left for Calli's office.
At the Wellness Hub, there was another girl waiting for her turn to be checked in.
The two people in the counters were busy with phone calls.
In a couple of minutes, the waiting room got filled up with students.
In a heartbeat, the announcements of the numbers beeped with hers, and then mine.
As soon as I stepped and exchanged good afternoons,
the lady with a scarf on her head called me by my name and asked me if I was
there to speak with Calli.
She confirmed that I knew where I was going and sent me on my way.

I spoke about what I had been wanting to talk about for the last three weeks.
It took me a while to get it out.
Starting is always easy.
I felt my words come out faster than usual and reminded me of the times that I
worried if speaking too fast was a sign of my potential bipolar disorder.
She was surprised when I told her that the last message of Sophie was asking
about how I was doing.

"What a journey that is."

When my session ended and we rescheduled in the next three weeks,
I went out with my coat in my hand and texted Sonny.
I waited for her at the lobby outside CaPS.
I saw a whiteboard offering walk-ins and considered the idea of going in and
asking about my future.

We walked uphill the rest of the way to Thomson House.
We had burgers and chatted for an hour and a half sharing a pitcher of dark beer.
Calli's last comments were about how the apps are particularly harder on some people.
She added a weirdly, but funny, out-of-place thought that one of them were shorter men.
She made me focus on the times that other people in my life have checked in on me,
or reached out.

A couple of hours later, I mentioned to Sonny,
again,
how the conversation—and potentially the relationship,
too—with Monica had just stopped, and how, similarly,
I stopped talking to those who were once my friends in university.

Going back two years ago,
when I was also worrying about a lack of responses from someone who I had gone
on a date with, I saw the same confessing text that I wanted to send.

_Honestly, I am starting to regret not asking to kiss you when we said
our good-byes._

Except that time, which I had not remembered,
I did send it and I did get a response.
Her proposition to kiss me next time we met was not out of the blue.

This time, it now feels wrong.
The situation is not the same.

"You can double-text her.
Triple, quadruple text", Calli reassured me, "people do that."

I opened my eyes and it was 4h.
I grabbed my phone and, once again,
shared a detailed retelling of the situation with a copy of the texts
exchanged to chatGPT asking for their opinion.
I wanted it to reassure me that she was interested and I wasn't just making it up.
I wanted it to tell me that it was totally fine to reach out and suggest me
the perfect text to break the silence.
Instead, I got an echo of what Alda, Sonny and my own conscience have told me.

"Considering the circumstances, I would give her a bit more time and space,
considering the recent events with her cat and potential stress."

### Wednesday, January 31st, 2024

_In the cathedrals of New York and Rome there is a feeling that you should
just go home and spend a lifetime finding out just where that is._

In an hour I have to get to the computer and sign in to the last French class
of the week.
Yesterday evening there was an issue with my headphones.
I signed in but I couldn't hear anything.
I am pretty sure the professor greeted me and it seemed like I purposefully
ignored him.

All class I was absentminded.
Unlike the day before, this time I was not reading old journal entries.
I got frustrated, like usual, with some of the answers of other students.
I was too tired to try to hide the annoyance from my face.
A couple of minutes before the pause I turned off my camera and just stood there,
on my seat, ignoring the talks that were happening in front of me.

The second half of the class I got an e-mail from MJM, the summary of the week.
I glanced at it and it said how there were 6 articles in Production.
I remembered a couple of days before that the thought crossed my mind that we
did not have enough associates to get the job done.
I had assigned an article to one that remained undone.
I had to do it myself in a rush after sending the wrong document to the author
to proofread.
I replied to everyone on the summary e-mail asking the section editors to
assign the articles to both Viet and me whenever they would send them to
Production.
I also wrote another e-mail to Sera and Bennett sharing the situation and my
worries about the lack of personnel.
With the help of chatGPT, I sent an e-mail to the two associates who had
been unresponsive.
This morning I got two e-mails.
The first one was a different person—who, I don't think, is even in the contact
sheet—telling me that she was excited to collaborate but hadn't yet been
assigned to any articles.
The second was from one of the associates telling me she had been on vacations
and was ready to get to work.

_Recordando el comienzo, fuiste tú quien me buscó; y lo bello que empezaba de
la nada terminó._

I feel a heaviness in my chest; a familiar heaviness of a task undone.
It's not the fact that I haven't worked a single minute today.
I wrote a message to the conversation but did not press send.
I see it there and imagine how it would be read on the other side of the screen.

I put my phone to charge.
I want it far away from me at this moment.
Sonny told me this morning to send it. _...pero no te va a responder._

She's right now sitting in my desk, doing some work for one of her clients.

We woke up pretty late today, past noon.
I almost begged her to get out for coffee and breakfast,
but this time it didn't take long for us to do it.

Tomorrow we'll see Aliza before her departure.
She is going to go on a cruise to the Caribbean.
A friend of hers is getting married and she's one of the bridesmaids.
She really liked Sonny.
I am glad.
They were sitting next to each other on _Dieu du ciel!_;
later in the night, Aliza turned towards Sonny and sheepishly asked her:
_podemos ser amigas?_

Aliza, since the very beginning, told me to text her.
She was not around two years ago.

This is not entirely like that.

When this page was unresponsive, I put the laptop away and went back to my phone.
I read the unsent message as if continuing reading it would clear my mind.
I exited the application and opened up old message conversations.

Last April I went out with Jerica.
We had a coffee and a stroll around _Le Canal de Lachine_.
We talked about our pets, our jobs and our friends.
We talked, and laughed, for hours and hours until the spring sun burnt our backs.
That same day I was supposed to meet Aliza at Church pub,
to which I got there late.
Weeks later she would ask me what had happened with this girl.
We did text for a bit.
This time there were not empty invitations to meet again.
Like all times, the conversation just ended.
One message, out of a sudden and without us noticing, was just the last.

## February, 2024

### Thursday, February 1st, 2024

_Hey, Sophie, I've been thinking about you.
I get you're going through a tough time.
Hope you're doing okay.
I would love to hear from you whenever you're ready._

Now, I will never now if given enough time she would have reached out.

We started watching Lovesick.
It's a series about a British guy who has been diagnosed with chlamydia and
thus has to reach out to his past sexual partners to notify them.
It's an anthology series of the different stories about how he met them,
entangled with the present time where he's having feelings for his best friend
who is engaged to some other guy.

I don't remember exactly when I watched it, but I know I like it.
When we first put it on, I mentioned to Sonny how, Luke, one of the characters,
the other member of the trio of best friends,
reminds me of Raul's best friend back in Salamanca.
Alberto.
Last night I could not remember his name.
He married.
. I can't remember hers.
The American girl who was doing her master's in education.
She was a twin.
Even a bigger slob than I was.
She called me _human dictionary_ a couple of times, even though, back then,
I was embarrassed to speak English out-loud.
I think I have him—probably not her—on Facebook;
for a couple of years he would congratulate me on my birthday.

We opened a can of beer and I barely could finish it.
Again, like clockwork, I started feeling bad around an hour after taking the pill.
I went to bed and left Sonny on the living room to finish the second episode
that was still playing.

By then, I had already made up my mind to send the text.
The timer would come back down to zero.
I could free up my mind.
Aliza mentioned that she would definitely reach back if I sent it,
yet the possibility that the response would not be of my liking was also
brought up.

We're meeting Aliza this evening.
We're going to a Korean chicken place around her neighborhood.
This will be the last time in the near future that Sonny and Aliza will hang out.

In the middle of the night,
the light of the monitor in the other side of my apartment creeped out of the
division by the bed.
Windows had restarted after initiating, unprompted, an update of its system.
The computer rebooted but logged in into the Linux partition, which,
for some reason, its logscreen doesn't go to sleep when inactive.
We let it be for a time.

It was around midnight—or was it 4h?—when I got up and shut it down.
I used the opportunity to go to the restroom before coming back to bed.

A couple of minutes past 4h, I was resigned of not going back to sleep.
I browsed my phone for a bit, instead of the usual tossing and turning.
At around 6h, I decided to get up and shower.

The water has been clogging for the past few days—or is it weeks?—,
yesterday I put the full kettle on and dumped the boiling water down the drain.
With the bubbling the dark edges of a hairball started surfacing to the top.
I used my tweezers to pick it up and pull it from the little holes of the drain.
I got maybe half of it.
It was not a full remedy but it did help.

I sent the text after I had come out of the bathroom, at around 6h50.
It bothers me, the amount of purple that is overloading the screen.
28 minutes ago, the timer restarted just like I wanted.
I threw away the possibility of proving me wrong and letting her resurface
just like I did after three weeks away, in exchange for some peace of mind.

It's not on me.
I reached out.
I did everything that I could have done.
Now, if she doesn't reply, if this is indeed like all those every other
conversations that just naturally ended,
then it was always because it was just not meant to be.

The funny thing is that, even after all this time, I never told her that I am trans.
There is always that possibility that she does come back,
that we do meet again, and that my being is a deal-breaker.
I have not forgotten about that.

31 minutes and counting.
We're meeting Aliza in less than 12 hours.
I will tell her that I sent the text.
I won't have anything else to say.

### Saturday, February 3rd, 2024

_It's those crumbs of attention mixed with the ignoring/avoiding parts that
does it for me._

I did not do the words last night.
The day was full with work, errands and a night of celebration.

Today I got up and had breakfast,
but other than that we did not get out of bed until 14h.
I showered and noticed how the drain is even more clogged than before.

Last night we finished both of our film rolls.
I could get some Drano on my way back from the photo lab.
Photo St-Denis closes at 17h.

I was irritated with life and that anger transpired towards Sonny.
When I got out of the shower she asked me if I was going to go out
and if she could come with me.

I took the small camera that I bought yesterday,
I could buy a cheap roll to try it out.

We got off at Sherbrooke and walked towards the place.
It was full.
The line to the counter came all the way to the stairs by the entrance.
When it was our turn, we picked up our negatives,
left the two complete rolls and bought another two.
They will be ready on Monday.

From there, we took a bus and went towards Laurier.
I offered Sonny to get some _gnocchis_ at _La drogheria fine_.
While on the bus, I bought some tickets for _Tótem_,
a film by a mexican filmmaker that was being projected at _Cinéma Moderne_.

We walked with our chinese takeout boxes towards _la brasserie_ that Alda and I
once went to, where we sat at their terrace and had a pint with fries.
We sat at the benches that were outside the windows.
We sat to have our food and I put the new cheap film to the Kodak Pony II.
I took a couple of pictures of Sonny to try it out.
The guys on the other side of the window inside the bar noticed me and posed
for the picture.

I did not like the movie.
I was annoyed at the family.
Sonny did.
She liked it more than _Poor Things_, she said.
She might have said that just to annoy me.

Yesterday I went to the lab by myself, unlike the day before.
I had promised Louis that I'd be there to meet the prospective student.
I left the house around 8h.
I was the first person to arrive at our office.
I continued working on the code for the HVR paper.
Daniel arrived not much later.

I found this ad in Fb Marketplace for a vintage Kodak Pony II camera.
It was working and in great condition.
It was only 35 CAD.
I took a screencap and sent it to Sonny.
It was cheaper than the price we had found for the helios lens that she'd buy
from me in order to take the Pentax Spotmatic with her.
I sent a message to the seller.

When Louis and the student came to the office and started chatting with us,
my watch vibrated notifying me of the response from the seller.
Apparently, some people had inquired about it but hadn't confirmed yet.
He proposed to me to give it until lunchtime,
if they still didn't respond, the camera was mine.

At around 11h, after Neda had arrived and all three of us talked to the
computer science student, the seller came back to tell me that they were not
picking the camera today.
I asked in return if that meant it was up for grabs and confirmed saying that,
if that were the case, I could come to his after work.
We agreed to meet at 18h.

In one of our group chats, Sonny had proposed to Alda to meet at our house and
drink the wine she brought us.
She said she would be at her sister's to watch RuPaul,
but could come maybe at 22h if that was an option.
In the end she told us that she would cancel with her sister and come earlier.

Daniel was the first person to leave.
I don't remember if Neda was still there when I took my stuff at 16h30.
I was hungry and considered buying something—a pizza, maybe?—at McGill station.
There were no pizza places at that station.
I took off on Guy-Concordia and bought two beef curry pastries at Cocobun.
I put them in my backpack and continued my trip towards station Du College,
almost at the end of the orange line.

I made a stop at a Tim Hortons on the way and ordered a medium black coffee.
The cashier kept responding to me in English even though I made the order in
French.
I sat by the window and had my pastries and coffe during the 20 minutes that
I had until 18h.

I texted Sonny and told her to go to _la fruiterie_ to get some cheese and grapes
for our wine.
She asked me to get some beers on my way home.
I confirmed with the seller and went on my way.

He lived with his parents,
who were in the living room while he opened the door to let me in.
We stayed at the entrance when he showed me the camera.
I declined his offer to use a dummy roll he had brought and just gave him the cash.
On my way back I took the bus to the metro station.

Before Alda arrived, we watched the first half of _Past Lives_.
Alda brought cookies and a can of kombucha.
Sonny cut the cheeses while I rinsed the grapes.
We put the cutting board with the charcuterie on the long table and sat around it.
We read the tarot.
We listened to some music while we talked.
The second half of the night we played with the pornographic deck of cards she gave us.
It was a nice night.

I walked Alda to her Uber outside the house at around 2h.

After finishing my words in the early morning,
I took my clothes and went to take a shower.
All clean and with my hair dripping wet, I went back to my room half-dressed
to wake Sonny up, since she would come to me to the lab this time.
I grabbed my phone and noticed that I had already gotten a response.
I caught a glimpse of the first couple of words of the notification at the top,
above the other two ones that said that Sophie had liked my messages.
I quickly closed it.
I did not want to read it then.
I was not ready to read her apology about not replying to me and that,
despite how nice I have been, she was not in the best position to continue seeing me.
Or maybe she would say that, after some thinking,
she was not ready to go out with anyone at this moment.
Perhaps, she had found someone, like Alda had warned me.
Whatever it was, I did not want to see it yet.

I had proposed to Sonny to pass by _la boulangerie_,
but when I told her I was considering not getting a croissant,
we decided against it.
We took the metro to station Sherbrooke and then caught the 24 bus.

We got to the office.
This time, we entered through the parking lot of the stadium.
I showed her the atrium with the neuron and then my office.
We left our stuff before going to café vienna so she could get something for breakfast.
I ordered her a BLT and we sat by the window.

She read the message.
I had told her not to tell me anything about what it said.
It didn't take much for her to convince me to just open it and read it myself.

"Hi Sofia! I'm really sorry for not responding", it started,
"It has been a though time, but I think I'm coming out on the other side of it.
Appreciate you understanding and reaching out, and would love to see you."

Like some other texts before, she signed it with a red heart.

For some reason, I was not relieved.
Did it mean we would then actually meet?
What could I tell her, or ask her?
What was then to say in what was now my turn?
Whatever it was I did not want to think about it.

When we were on our way back, we intended to take the lift, but it was not moving.
I was in the middle of failing to convince her to take the stairs, when the doors closed.
I got downstairs and saw how she was talking with Louis.
Apparently, he had gone out of the office after she had just gotten out of the elevator.

"Are you looking for someone?", he asked her.

"No, I am waiting for someone."

"Oh, I see you found whom you were looking for!",
he came back to say when I join her.

Sonny worked under the neuron, while I went back to my office.
Around noon we went to the café again for lunch.
We shared a burger.
After my meeting with Louis, she said that hers had been cancelled.
We went to Thomson House.
We had a pitcher of beer with a basket of wedges.
I can't remember what we talked about,
but it was enough to last us a second pitcher of beer instead of our original
plan of going to the McGill's book store.

We took the metro to meet Aliza at the korean place in Verdun.
We would have arrived at the same time,
were not for the stop we had to do on the way so Sonny could relieve herself
on the back parking lot of a building.

When I had told Alda, she had said to wait a day before replying.
I settled with myself to text her that night, as a compromise with myself.
In the first portion of our last meeting with Aliza before her departure to Miami,
she convinced me to reply to Sophie right then and there.

"I'm honestly very glad to read you're doing better.
I'd love to see you, too.
Whenever it works for you, I'm pretty free in the near future."

With those words sent off, I continued our night with Aliza.

### Sunday, February 4th, 2024
_You just need to practice "Speaking" more;
because that is one of the most important parts of the test._

Technically it's Monday now.
Even though I did not take the pills last night, I had to go to bed very early.
It was not even 21h yet, when we both gave up on whatever it was on TV and
turned all the lights down before going to bed.
When I grabbed my phone, it was only 1h.

I've been looking into hinge less and less.
It's not that I don't hope she's going to reach out.
I do hope for it, I just don't like admitting it.
I pretend that I believe she won't, but deep down I long to be proved wrong.
Except, now it's less and less like that.

When I talked with Alda about it, she suggested again to propose to cook for her.
She actually did that with Soud as a second date.
She got fixated on him, too.
Her therapist told her that whenever she felt the urge to reach out,
to distract herself with activities or friends.
I said that I would not text again at least until Sonny left.

In the morning, Sonny was the first to get out of bed.
She had agreed to meet with both Alda and Veronica to go to Mass.
This time, they would not try to go to that church by NDG,
but a closer one around station Berri UQAM.
We had thrown around the idea of me catching up with them and going for brunch.

We had this thing, where we make use of the time of the other one leaving—be it
me going to the lab, or, like this time, her going to church—to masturbate.
I was still in bed when I heard the door close behind her.
I put my hands inside my shorts and, still under the covers,
turned towards the wall.
It didn't take me long to finish.
It had been a while since the last time.
This time it was not as clean as usual, except I didn't notice it.
Later, I went to the restroom and saw the spots on both my underwear and my shorts.
I felt disgusted with myself, but the feeling faded pretty quickly.

We didn't have any more coffee.
I asked her to bring some on her way back.

I sat on the couch in the living room and continued watching "Mr and Mrs Smith".
I was not paying too much attention.
My phone vibrated with messages from Alda.
It was close to noon.
She was inviting me to catch up, do brunch.
I could get free coffee.
At first, I was hesitant.
I did not want to shower or get out.
She didn't have to push too hard before I started convincing myself.
I sent her a text letting her now of my change of mind and asking her for where
to meet.
I put some clothes and left towards the metro.

I did not get a response—either a text or a pick up to my calls—until I was
waiting for the metro.
I tried Sonny, too, but she probably didn't have any data.
I was sincerely annoyed.
Alda was very apologetic.
I was aware I was overly irritated and probably projecting my own frustrations
of not being replied to by other person.
She proposed paying for my food, but I told her not to worry about it.

We met at Ginkgo.
They were already inside, but still not yet seated when I arrived.
Since we didn't have a reservation, they sat us in a table with swings.
Me and Alda were the ones who took those seats.
They were not as uncomfortable as they looked.

We had a pitcher of Paloma with our food.
The waitress replied to us always in French,
despite the fact that Vero and Alda would fall back to English.
Sonny was proud of herself for ordering in French.

From there, we got an Uber to bifteck.
I was surprised that Vero joined us.
We bought two pitchers of stout beer and Vero had a rhum and coke.
There was a women's hockey match on the televisions.
I can't remember what we talked about.

Alda got us an Uber to La Banquise.
The waitress served us in English.
They sat us next to two québécoises women.
I didn't have a poutine there.
I had the idea of waiting and getting one from ma poule mouillée as take-out.
Sonny and I shared a beer.
We paid our bills, but didn't leave soon enough.
The waitress came and kicked us out gently,
letting us know they had a long line waiting for a table.

I ordered my poutine at the portuguese restaurant in French,
but the woman had trouble understanding me.
I had told Sonny a couple of days ago, how I feel stupid speaking in French.

When we got home, I barely had a half of my food before giving up on the day.

### Monday, February 5th, 2024
_I miss my body._

I was excited about receiving the photo scans today.
I had been waiting for those pictures of Cuba for a while.

I woke up in the early morning, before the sun rose,
and went to the living room to do the words in the dark.
I worry that I will have nothing to write about when Sonny leaves.
I am anxious about her departure.
The bed will feel empty without her.
The apartment will be colder.
There will be something missing from my days.

I went back to bed and slept until mid-morning.
Whenever that passes, I open up the mail just to check there is nothing from
Louis and go turn my back towards the day.
This was such the case, that I even asked Sonny to go to the café to get the
bag of coffee beans that had run out.
I half-expected her to say no.
To keep postponing her getting out of bed.
She actually went and I stayed in bed.
I considered masturbating again, but didn't.

She came back around noon and I brewed coffee for both us.
I had not yet finished my cup of coffee by the time the e-mail with the
WeTransfer link arrived.

In the morning, while I was still half-awake,
I even considered offering Sophie to exchange instagram with the intention of
sharing with her the pictures I had taken in Cuba.
I could come out of nowhere and excitedly tell her that the pictures I had
waited for so long were there.

The pictures were shit.

I liked more the ones taken with Sonny's camera.
The coloured effects of the flash gave the shots some sort of nostalgic aura.

Sonny asked me to send her the pictures.
She brought up that I haven't still shared with her all of the other film
pictures that I've taken these past years.
With that in mind, I opened up my Google account and went back in the years
in order to clean the clutter and give some organization to the mess.

I saw my body change shapes.
Being thinner and thinner after breaking up with Catherine.
Gaining weight after moving to DC and starting the relationship with Sonny.
Losing it again when I came to Montréal.
Gaining it again.
My hair would get longer and longer until it became short.
Then it kept grewing once again until this new year's when it got even shorter.

I deleted all of the memes and all of the screenshots of conversations.
I read the countless snapshots of _I did not feel a connection_;
several occasions of offers of staying friends just to disappear for ever.

I'm in the middle of French class.
The professor is explaining the significance and use of the words _itinérants_
and _mechants_.
I can't focus.
I can't do this anymore.
Just 300 more words.
It seems such a hardious task.
I'd like to go to bed and sleep for the rest of the week,
were it not for the fact that after Friday I will go back to waking up alone.

I don't know if I want to text her because I feel sad or I feel sad because I
want to text her.

During class I posted one of the pictures from Sonny's roll.
The one where Alda and I are in the shot in my living room,
in front of the cutting board full with cheeses and grapes.
I am holding the Kodak camera I had just bought.

Someone was saying something in class,
when Sonny came towards me and told me that Alda had asked me to take it down.
I grabbed my phone and saw a bunch of texts—not too different to the ones I
sent her yesterday morning—asking me to take of the tag or, better yet,
crop the picture.
She didn't like how her hair looked.

I don't judge her.
I know how that feels.
I apologized and took down the picture immediately.
I cropped it just like she suggested and reposted with a bunch of other
portraits that Sonny have taken.

I don't care about the likes.
I don't care how many people have seen them.

When class ended I felt like crying.
I lied down on the couch while Sonny cooked her own dinner.
I put on some songs on Youtube until she finished.
We had dinner together and I took my pills.
Yesterday I skipped them.

I'm at the exact the same spot I was two years ago.

### Sunday, February 11th, 2024
_Yesterday I finally got the pictures from Cuba developed.
I wanted to text you about it, but idk if you'd prefer some space for now._

The house feels empty and silent.

Wednesday I skipped French.
I had to go to the lab that day.
We had a meeting with Pedro's team to talk about the abstracts we submitted
using their data.
Neda started talking about her disease offset staging methods.
Reza was next with the Brain Age Gap measure from his Neural Network.
Lastly, I spoke about the mediation models of amyloid and tau on cognition.

Pedro did not like mine.
He asked me about the research question,
implying that my main results are something well-known already.
He asked me about the advantages of using structural equation modeling rather
than a conventional interaction.
I answered him to the best of my knowledge,
but I was still stumped by his questions.
When we walked back to the office,
Neda made a comment saying how she liked the way I answered.

I left early the office.
Sonny and Alda were supposed to meet at Namur station and go shopping at some
outlets that Sonny had found online.
The original plan was for me to meet them later in the evening when they went
to the McGill's Bookstore.
I intercepted their meeting meeting Sonny at station Bonaventure after taking
the 107 bus.
We met Alda at the third-to-last station of the orange line.

We went to the first store.
When we passed the parking lot,
I saw a Dollarama and decided to go in and see if they had some Drano.
I asked them to go ahead to the store and I would meet them later.
When I got the shelves with the white bottles, they came up to me.
The store was closed.

We went to the first one that was right besides the station.
I got a pair of shorts, three t-shirts and two bralettes.
Sonny got some pants, a t-shirt—matching with mine—, and a coat.
Alda got herself some stuff, too.
Later that night, she would send us pictures of her fits.

We skipped the McGill's store and went directly to the Plateau to meet with
Veronica for dinner at La Arepera.
She, much like Pedro earlier, was not impressed.

After eating and getting our checks,
we went for some drinks at Else's to finish the night.

All four of us walked together to station Sherbrooke.
Veronica left first.
I offered to stay with Alda to wait for the 144 bus.

We told her there about the movie we would watch the next day.
The first women-directed movie in Québec, _La vie rêvée_.
She went online and got herself a ticket.

Walking home, I offered to get us some beers and chips.
Sonny asked me for the keys, since she really needed to go to restroom.
I asked her not to lock the door and we went our one ways at the corner of the
dépanneur.
I just opened the first can from the four-pack I bought that night.
The unopened bag of flamin' hot cheetos is still on the bar of my kitchen.

When I got to the apartment, the door was locked.
I replied to the text of Alda that said she was home joking that Sonny had
locked me out.
Less than 3 minutes later, I see her opening the entrance door.

She had to make a stop at a nearby alley.
When she told me while grabbing her pajama pants and getting into the restroom,
I did not believe her.
When she got out from her shower, she warned me not to look inside.
The water from the sink was also pooled and brown-tinted.
The unopened bag of Drano stayed in my backpack.

"Would love to see the photos!
I'm back at work next week on Wednesday/Friday on campus if you want to do
lunch at Thomson house or something together!"

For the first time since I could remember, I stopped waiting for a notification.
She had sent hearts before but this was the first time they were more than one
and at the beginning of the text.
Unlike the previous time, I opened it immediately.

Sonny went to Dollarama and bought a plunger.
It was more effective than the Drano that I used on the sink.

I had my meeting with Louis at home.
An hour later, Sonny had hers.
Our plan for her last night was to get some gnocchis before the movie.
Then we would meet with Aliza at Church to welcome her back.

We got off at Sherbrooke and walked to pick up the negatives.
We then walked towards the stop for the same bus that we used the last time.
It wasn't until we stepped off that I realized the place might not be open.

We hesitated about where to eat.
We considered Siboire St-Laurent—the bar that Alda liked that time we had some
fries at their terrace—and _Dieu du ciel!_,
but in the end we went directly to _Cinéma Moderne_ and got ourselves a sandwich.
We sat the the corner table by the entrance.
Alda joined us with enough time to spare to get herself a drink and for me to
get a second one and a bowl of popcorn.

There were talks with the director before and after the movie.
At the end,
when I told Sonny they had said they were wrapping up,
she asked me if that meant she could raise her hand.
She mentioned how it was fate for her to watch that movie on her last day of
vacations in Montréal.
Some people clapped for her.
She later met the director.
I took some pictures of them.

I invited Alda to join us to meet Aliza, but she said no.
Aliza texted us saying that maybe we could meet at her house instead.
Sonny and I could get some drinks on the way and maybe order some food.
We tried to get into the Metro on the way, but the night-shift workers that
were just going out told me _C'est fermé_.

This time I did remember the code to get inside Aliza's building.
We had kung-pao chicken and dumplings at her house.
She asked me about updates with Sophie, and I told her that I had not replied,
not because of some straigth advice from Alda, but rather a sincere need for time.

Aliza invited me to go with her and Liana to watch the Super bowl today.
We said our good-byes and left.

Friday we got our _gnocchis_.
We went for a couple of beers to _Dieu du ciel!_.
I took a couple of pictures of her.

We came back to our place and I got us an Uber to the airport.
I saw her make the line before security and wore my headphones all the way to
the 747 bus.

It was the longest commute home I have ever had.
For the whole weekend the sun didn't come out.
I cancelled the plans with Alda and Aliza.
I got myself pizza tonight and started rewatching New Girl.

I haven't heard back from Sophie.
Sonny thought that she might realize she asked me out on Valentine's and will
ask me to postpone.

Instead, I just worry that I will meet her, but I won't be enough.

### Monday, February 12th, 2024
_The plans with Julian fell through,
and now I really want to go on a date for Valentine's...
I really hope I find someone who cares more next time._

I was the first person to get in the office.
I went to bed early and started having side effects from the medication.
Just the anguish and uneasiness in bed made me consider again to suspend them
indefinitely.
I should call and make an appointment with the psychiatrist.
The prescription is going to run out in two refills.
I can make use of the opportunity and come clean telling him that I suspended
them because of the weight gain and the side effects despite still feeling depressed.
As I am writing these words, I am thinking about talking with this with Calli.
I can hear in my head how she would tell me that I have the right to tell him
that and together look for other options.
Why doesn't it feel like this?

I postpone the alarm from 7h45 to 8h30.
I showered and changed.
I made coffee and left.
I listened to music the whole way to the lab.
I considered walking from station Sherbrooke to the MNI,
but decided against it at the last minute.

Neda was the second one to arrive.
Then, it was Daniel.
Vlad never came.
I thought he was supposed to come back from vacations today,
but I guess I was mistaken.
We had a meeting during which Reza presented a paper.
It was one of those days when I get too aware that I am in a room full of
engineers.

I asked Louis if he had 3 minutes after the meeting and talked with him about
processing the data from PreventAD.
A couple of days ago I got an e-mail from someone from Sylvia's team asking to
touch base before her departure on vacations.
I had completely forgotten about that pending task since before I left to
Mexico last year.
We set up a meeting for tomorrow at 10h.

I kept working on the graphical abstract the rest of the day.
It took me a full day from start to finish.
It is a task that I had been postponing since last year,
and it took me less than a full 8h shift.
When I was almost done, I realized it was already 16h30.
I took my stuff, said good-bye to my office mates and left.

On the way home I made a stop at _la fruiterie_.
I bought some hummus, pitas, ham, a tomato and a pepper.
This was despite the fact that I had still the leftovers from yesterday's pizza
to have for dinner.

I got home with 30 min before the start of French class.
I skipped the last one, so I was dreading having to give some explanations about it.
The professor did reply to my e-mail somewhen during the week-end.
The class was nothing special.
I get more and more frustrated.
I feel so advanced compare to the rest of the people in the class yet I feel
like the stupidest person when I try to speak with someone and they fail to
understand me.

Alda sent me a message today telling me she had made the oral evaluation at the
YMCA and they had put her somewhere between B1 and B2 levels.
I try not to compare myself to her,
yet the first thing I thought when I read it was how whenever we go out,
I am the only one who has the initiative to order in French.
The waiters can barely understand me when I do it, though.
Monica didn't.

I finished watching Hazbin Hotel during the weekend.
I proposed Sonny to watch it together while she was here.
I can't get one of the songs out of my head.

Sophie hasn't replied to my text.

I wrote the text that I meant to send to Tirza telling her that I want to delete Hinge.
In it I give her my number in case she still/ever wants to meet and tell her it
was nice meeting her in case she doesn't.
I did not send it.

I think about all the stuff I want to tell Sophie.
I think of possible things we could do.
I think about whether she will reject me after our date, or if I won't get the
chance to see her again.
No, we will meet.
Most probably I will text her tomorrow night asking about meeting the day after
and she'll reply Thursday, like the past two times, proposing Friday.
We'll change the plans from lunch to a _5 à 7_ after work.
We'll meet and I'll have a great time.
I will neither tell her that I am trans nor ask to kiss her.
The whole week-end will pass and after double-texting her for the last time,
she will let me down gently and maybe even with a red heart somewhere in the text.

### Tuesday, February 13th, 2024
_Seriously?
After being cancelled on twice and waiting a week for a response,
you're still considering reaching out again?
Come on, you deserve better than that.
Stop wasting your time on someone who clearly doesn't prioritize you.
It's time to move on and find someone who actually appreciates you._

_...Sure, she's responding, but actions speak louder than words.
If she's constantly cancelling plans and taking forever to reply,
it doesn't sound like she's genuinely interested or making you a priority.
Don't let a few sweet words cloud your judgement.
Pay attention to how she's actually treating you._

Around 1-2h, I turned on the night light, got out of bed and went to the closet
to get the fresh set of clean sheets that I did not use all the month that Sonny
was here.
This time I did not worry about losing the faint smell of the presence of Sonny
like I did with Monica's.
I changed the sheet, the pillow-cases and the duvet cover.
I threw the old ones to the empty clothes hamper and went under the rejuvenated bed.
The internet started failing but I didn't care since it was not hard to get to sleep.

I woke up before the first alarm and automatically went to postpone it.
I battled inside my head the opposing ideas of staying home and going to meet
Louis in person.
Wondering what I could wear, I try to open the weather app,
but my phone complained instead about connectivity issues.
The meeting home would be a no-go.
I turned off the alarm and decided to skip the shower and just change clothes.
The thought about the internet failing even in the afternoon for my French
class started worrying me.
I despised the idea of having to call Videotron customer service and schedule a
meeting with a technician.
Something made me think about checking for the lights in the modem.
I realized that everything was off on the small box that connects to the router.
I turned my head and saw how last night that I threw the sheets to the hamper I
had disconnected the plug from the outlet.
I decided to stay home at the same time that I threw myself back to my now navy
blue bed.

I did not sleep again.
I made coffee and started working.
At 10h I sent Louis a text on Teams but he did not see it.
I sent him an e-mail.
He didn't take long before replying back.
We talked for about 20 minutes and came to an agreement of what to do next.

At noon, I cooked myself some eggs and ham for breakfast.

Aliza texted me to say that Vlad mentioned he misses me and wants me to go with
them to Church this Saturday.
I am still unsure if I will go or not.
I made no promises, yet the fact that I cancelled my week-end plans with Aliza
last time make me lean towards one side of the dilemma.
I don't know if I have enough energy to deal with Vlad.

Years ago I went out with Laura, a Colombian girl who was doing a semester
abroad at _Université de Montréal_.
We went to _Parc la Fontaine_ and took some pictures with our film cameras.
I did not develop that roll until last month.
We still follow each other on Instagram.
She posted about this card game _We're not really strangers_.
Alda had the idea of buying it and playing with Julian,
the guy she was saying until recently.
He was supposed to come visit her for Valentine's but cancelled last minute.

I asked Alda if she wanted to play the game together one of these days.
I offered to get a bottle of wine,
but I suggested thinking of something less romantic after I remembered that
yesterday I thought how that would be a great date idea.
After a very brief back-and-forth we concluded on meeting Thursday with a
bottle of Amaretto and some ginger beers.
She mentioned that the game would be very similar to what we already play.
_Trauma-bonding the drinking game_.
Maybe it is.
I am still excited.
Lately, I crave intimacy.

French is getting worse and worse.
It's hard to focus.
Still, I waited until the class ended this time to start with the words.

I don't know if I will text Sophie tonight.
I am considering sending to Tirza the draft I put in my Notes.
I always reach out to Tirza when I get disillusioned with Sophie.

I know what I should do, but I don't know if I can.

### Wednesday, February 14th, 2024
_Y aún me parece mentira que se escape mi vida imaginando que vuelves a pasarte
por aquí, donde los viernes, cada tarde, como siempre,
la esperanza dice_ quieta, hoy quizás sí.

I am sitting in a corner table at Thomson House.
I could go home right now, make a stop at SAQ and get the bottle of amaretto
for tomorrow.
Aliza just texted me asking if I had my date.

Last night, even though I really didn't want to, I sent the text.
This time I was the one who used a red heart as an end-of-sentence point.
I hated myself.

I heated the last bowl of beans that I made with Sonny.
Before going to bed, I brushed my teeth and flossed.
I could smell myself but decided against showering.
My scent was not off-putting.
I kind of liked it.
The whole night I slept surrounded by a combination of my own personal smell
and the scent from the recently changed sheets.

I started waking up around 2h.
I tossed and turned but kept avoiding my phone.
I did not want to light up the screen and take the cat out of the dead-or-alive box.
I avoided it until the last time I woke up, 25 minutes before my alarm.
I opened Hinge and there were not any red number on the bottom banner of buttons.
I opened the bubble chat anyway.
After sending my text,
I had archived the conversation as a way of putting it out of my way,
and yet I saw the animation of her name jumping from the bottom pile to the top.
I had to put my finger on it for it to actually load the new message.
It wasn't too old, just a couple of minutes.

She told me how tomorrow—she meant today—was still tentatively an option.
She had a meeting just before lunch, and thus she wouldn't have a whole hour,
though.
That was the caveat of seeing her today, but she was down if I was game.
This time the final heart was blue coloured,
just like the one in her message last year wishing me safe travels after we
first met.

I told her it was fine with me and followed up giving her my phone number,
in case it was easier.
Later in the morning, when I came out of the shower,
I saw her blue text telling me she was Sophie from Hinge.
We agreed to meet at Thomson, at around 12h45.

I brought back the text from my notes and sent it to Tirza before brewing my
coffee and grabbing my stuff to leave my apartment.

I came and sat down at exactly 12h45.
I moved from a single table to the set of three tables in the corner,
because of my irrational fears of eavesdroppers.
She texted me that she was on her way and arrived not too far off her ETA.

Like last time, she threw at me the—empty?—promise of meeting again.
_Let's do something again when I come back from Ottawa._
Two years ago I would have joked with Alda and Armando about the pattern of
people disappearing after trips to Ontario.

I showed to her the pictures I had promised,
but got the feeling she was rushed to leave and did it just to appeace me.

After Aliza's question, I told her about how I can't read Sophie.
Part of me suspects this whole meeting was just an attempt to placate my insistance.
Why would she offer to meet again, then?

I want to not reach out again until I talk with Calli next Thursday,
but I don't know if I will be able to.

15 min ago I opened Hinge and saw the reply from Tirza.
She told me she'd save my number and hoped that my dropping the app was a
success story.
There was also a red 1 above the heart symbol.
I opened the profile and recognized the picture.
She wrote a message asking me about the picture where I am in the lift of my
hotel in Glasgow.
I felt drawn to the app again.

I got a notification from Sophie before starting the last paragraph.

"Back & meeting is finished.
Definitely need to work on my diplomacy lmao."

Below there is a warning stating that she has disabled her notifications.
I can reply to her later.

I am not sure why I feel this deep urge to start crying,
but like my request to kiss her, I just can't let it out.

### Friday, February 16th, 2024
_Sofia, it was truly a pleasure to play this game with you!
I love how we can get to be honest and vulnerable with each other!
Cheers to our friendship! Cheers, Alda_

For some reason I could not want to wake up in the morning yesterday.
No, I remember.
The night before my legs were hurting.
Excruciatingly.
I was awake for most of the night.
In the morning, I postpone the alarm despite my plans for going to the lab
and to Alda's from there in the afternoon.

I turned off the alarm and continued sleeping.
Around 10h or 11h, I sent an e-mail to Louis saying I was feeling a bit sick
and asking to cancel our 1-on-1 meeting of the afternoon.
He agreed without any issue.

I texted Alda asking about what time would work for meeting.
Talking, we agreed that it would be better to do it at my house,
since it'd be more private.
We would be talking about some deep and personal stuff.
It was more convenient for me, too,
since the ginger beers and the amaretto were both at my house already.

I don't think I worked a single minute during the whole day.
I stayed in bed for a significant amount of the day.
Alda would come at around 17-18h.
I watched some television.
I put this show, _One day_.
Online people say that it is a devastating show.
I don't really like watching romance fiction, I find it very hard to relate to it.
The majority is straight, but even when watching a lesbian work,
it feels foreign to me.
I had started it a couple of days ago—or was it weeks?—, but yesterday I put
it from the beginning again.
By the second or third episode I started dripping off and losing attention.
I can't remember if I put something else,
or that was around the time that Alda came.

I started drinking one of the _Dieu du ciel!_ beers that I would drink with Sonny.
It's funny how I've been getting them since I moved here in July of last year,
yet now whenever I have them I think about sharing them with Sonny.

I had had half of a can already when Alda rang the doorbell and I went to buzz
her in.
She brought her card games, but we didn't start to play at that very moment.
We had some amaretto and ginger beers together.
It tasted fine but it was not the best.
We moved the table and opened the red box.
I was sitting in my desk chair and she got the couch.

Three levels: Perception, Connection, and Reflection.
Alda thought that level two would be the hardest, I was dreading the third one.
The questions got deeper and deeper with each level.
We draw portraits of each other.
For one card, we had to call someone we admired and we called Sonny,
who was with some of her friends.

Halfway through, we went to IGA and got some pigs in a blanket, grapefruit juice,
and some other stuff.
Later that night we ordered some pizza and fries.

We got really drunk.
Mostly I.
The final card was during level II.
We took it out in the middle of the game and just put it aside.
It asked to us to write each other a small note that we would not open until
parting ways.

She left.
I puked twice before going to bed.
I don't remember if I took my pills.

"Hey, it's a longshot but would you be down to do something spontaneous after
work today?
We talked about meeting up after your trip,
but I'd love to spend some extra time with you before you go."

Last night, I went to bed drunk with the idea of texting Sophie.
I thought about asking her out for today.
I knew she would most probably say no,
but the idea of seeing her before her departure was too much to let go.
I considered it and crafted the message, something not too pushy, or cringey.
I keep thinking back about how Monica would react to them.
Can't help to think back to two years ago.

I sent it out when I woke up 15 minutes before 7h.
This time she didn't take days to reply.
There were no hearts either.

"Hey! I would love to - unfortunately,
I'm already pretty scheduled up this weekend and I need to take some time to
decompress before the trip."

### Saturday, February 17th, 2024
_"Sí sabes que es de antes de que fuera Sofía, ¿no?"_

_"Nope. Tú siempre has sido Sofía, tho."_

This is one of those days where I have nothing particular to write about.
Were it not for the fact that I talk loudly to myself,
I would have not said a single word all day.

Tomorrow I will go to the laundry.
I haven't gone since Sonny left.
I could read something there, and the walk will be useful.
I guess I could take the kindle tonight and read in the metro.
The last book I started was _Little Blue Encyclopedia (for Vivian)_,
I might have to drop it.
I feel no interest whatsoever in going back to it.

Aliza had asked me to go out with her this Saturday.
Vlad, who actually started the whole thing, hasn't said anything about it all week.
In the end we agreed to going out anyway.

The latest plan is going to an irish pub in Verdun.
We haven't been there.
I probably won't drink too much.
I am taking the bet to lose weight more seriously than I thought I would be.
For a minute I considered skipping dinner last night together with the pills
that go with it.
I slept early.
I did get up.
I heated the two remaining slices of the pizza I had with Alda and went on to
do the words.
I could have, maybe, done twice the amount of words to fix the streak.
I didn't feel like it.
It was hard enough to complete the 750 usual ones despite having two days to
talked about.

I dreamed again of something that made me think that it was an interesting story.
Those kinds of ideas that could be develop into a book or a movie.
Something that I would definitely watch or read.
I've forgotten most of it already.
It probably faded even by the time that I eventually got out of bed.

I left half of the curtains open but that didn't stop me to sleep in.
I buried my face between the two pillows and try to go back to my dreams.
When I couldn't, I turned towards the wall,
pulled my underwear down and started masturbating.
I thought about Alexia.
Putting my arm through hers and walking through _St-Laurent_,
her putting her hand over my thigh when we sat down in that bench,
my looking up towards her face before silently asking to kiss her.
Whenever I think of that night, I rarely get to the part where we're
actually having sex.

Does she ever think of me?
Perhaps she thinks of my like I do of the québécoise girl;
that girl whose name she can't remembers that had sex with on her trip of
Montréal for her birthday.
Perhaps I am just the trans girl she once fucked.
Or maybe she doesn't think about me at all.

When I got obsessed with—did I just forget her name?—Flore,
I looked her up on the internet.
She left for her week-long trip with her lab and I couldn't control myself.
I knew her first name, her university, and the fact that her supervisor was a
portuguese women in computer science.
I found her supervisor's website and from its Personnel site,
I found her last name.
With her full name, it was easy to find her online.

The second person I looked up like that was the catfisher.
She was a receptionist at a Hospital in Montréal.
I don't remember how I found her, but I got her real socials.
I found out she had a kid.
I realized that not only was she real, but she was normal.

I did not have sex with either of these women.
I didn't kiss them.
The latter I didn't even meet in person.

The first women I ever got obsessed with was Monica.
I recognized her from the crowds and would wait for her to pass by every
morning on her way to her classroom.
For months I knew who she was without knowing her name.
Years later we would be together and one could argue that for all that time
she did not know who I was either.

I didn't look Kate online because there was no need to.
During our first date she made a joke about stalking people she dated on
Instagram.
I consciously offered her mine so she wouldn't need to look me out.
My obsession with her manifested differently.

These obsessive traits are not cute nor romantic.
I am not proud of it, but ashamed.
It's creepy and toxic.

Yesterday I found out Sophie's last name.

### Sunday, February 18th, 2024
_Hey! Remember me?
I was reading my journal from two years ago and got to the time we met.
How's life been treating you?_

I did not get up early enough either to brew myself coffee nor to go to the
laundromat.
I could have well gone later in the afternoon, but decided not to do it.
I weighted myself and I am back to the weight I was three days ago when Alda
and I first came with the idea of the losing-weight-bet.
It's mostly water-based weight, I am sure, yet it still felt good.

Yesterday I left the apartment and went to meet Aliza at _Le Trèfle_.
She got there before I did.
The host welcomed me in French and I explained to him that my friend was
already waiting for me.
It didn't take me long to find Aliza sitting on a two-person table by the window.

On my way there I had been thinking about the fact that in most of our meetings,
when we don't talk about work, we talk about me and my relationships.
Either how I hadn't yet told Alda about my being trans,
the fact that I haven't spoken with Monica since she was here,
my excitement for Sonny coming,
my dates.
Is it because of what Monica had told me before that I can be a very selfish friend?
Or is it more because of Aliza's own reserved personality?

The first topic of conversation, and the bigger one for the night,
was about her relationship—and its soon potential end—with Ally.
They haven't been talking for a while.
She had mentioned to me before how her girlfriend is going through an
emotionally hard time.
She had also told me about the talk she was invited to give at Harvard.
She might come visit her soon, but the situation is tense.

I did not have dinner with Aliza.
Before leaving I had made myself a pita sandwich with hummus and ham.
At the bar, I got myself a cocktail with the intention of ordering some chilli
and chips later, and only because I needed food to have with my pills.
Instead, when I ordered my second cocktail,
I explained to Aliza that I would rather make a stop at Shawarmaz and
getting myself a poutine.

We made plans to see each other Thursday after her class at Thomson House.

Yesterday I had posted a post the event at Palco this Friday—the queer-lesbo
night that will happen at Aliza's neighborhood—in the group chat we have with Alda.
I thought it would go ignored, but Aliza responded this morning that she is in.
Alda reminded me that she won't be in town,
since she leaves for Albania on Wednesday.
I wished her safe travels.

A couple of moments ago I considered asking her if she wanted to do something
before she leaves.
Maybe I can text her tomorrow and we could meet Tuesday.
Except, as I just remembered, I have French class the whole half of the week
she will be here.
I just finished cooking and having my dinner.
I did not do laundry but I did go to IGA.
Walking there with Alda when she was here made me realize how close it is.
I got some salad and dressing and vegetables, some hummus and eggs.
I cooked one of the pork chops and the pepper I had bought at _la fruiterie_.

I continued the task I started yesterday.
I read the entries from my first date with Kate up to the date with Amanda.
I weighted 70 kg when I went to Puerto Vallarta.
I remembered how last time I did this I also went through the pictures of that time.
That depressed me quite a bit.
The day I met Kate I was wearing the dark red hoodie with the denim jacket.
I like the way I looked.
I was quite attractive.
I had no reason to be this insecure.

Is it the weight?
I hate the pictures on which I appear.
I hate how I look in the videos that Sonny took.
My face contorts in weird ways.
My mouth moves strangely.
My neck is too thick and my body's shape is unattractive.

Do I have a reason to feel unattractive now or will I look back to this
pictures with nostalgia?
Maybe I will read through these entries eventually.
Life is a cycle.
The situation might be the same but the way I am facing it most certainly is not.

### Monday, February 19th, 2024
_Quisiera—quiero—tener el autocontrol suficiente para ya no mandarle nada;
que si me busque se dé, y si no muestra interés en mí, que ahí muera._

I did not go to the lab today.
I woke up early enough, maybe even before the alarm sounded, yet I did not get up.
I buried my head between the pillows and stayed there.
The sunlight came through the half of the window uncovered by the drapes.
I did not fall asleep again.

A couple of minutes after my last turn, I uncovered myself and stood up.
I put on the leggings that were lying on the floor and went to pee.
I forgot my phone in the bed,
so I had to go back for it in order to record the weight for today.
I gained the kilogram that I had brag about losing to Sonny and Alda.
I knew it was mostly water, it still felt demotivating.

Last night I made myself some roasted potatoes and had them with a pita
sandwich of hummus and pork.
After finishing, I felt a hunger that was not there the rest of the day.
That and the fact that I had that familiar anguish only 30 minutes after
taking the antipsychotics made me reconsider suspending them once again.

I went to the kitchen and noticed how I did not have enough coffee.
I put on a hoodie, a beanie, my coat and the pair of red boots,
and I went outside to get another bag.
When Sonny was here, she told me not to pay with the credit card for the coffee,
as it was apparently a couple of dollars cheaper with cash.
Maybe it's just because without the terminal there is no prompt to give a tip.
I wore no headphones.
My hands got cold.
It still will be winter for a couple of months.

When I got back, I brewed my coffee and got to work.
Surprisingly it was quite a productive day.
I've been putting music on the speakers in the living room while I work on my desk.
I am almost done with the manuscript.
I still have the PreventAD data to keep me busy.
I will probably go to the lab tomorrow.
I told Aliza—or was it Sonny?—that my plan nowadays will be to not calculate
the departure of the 144 bus and rather walk from station Sherbrooke to the
lab if the wait is longer than 10 minutes.

I took my phone just now and realized that the walk from the metro station to
the lab is 25 minutes.
The walk from the bus stop for the 24 is 11 minutes,
except that that route is uphill.

Let's see what I do tomorrow.

I picked up the book that I left on hold since last year.
I didn't make a lot of progress.

I had dinner a couple of paragraphs ago.
I am starting to feel the damned side effects again.
They are coming and going.
I don't even feel like finishing these words.

I finished reading the entries from Kate's last text until yesterday's entry.

In the afternoon, a bit before the start of French class,
I exported the entries from the 750 words website.
While my classmates were going through the activity,
taking turns to read or answer the exercises that I had already finished,
I was compiling all of the different text files for each month into a hugh
markdown file.
I cleaned the days' metadata and titled each year.
I asked Sonny earlier today if she still thinks it's a task worth of my time.
I reminded her how she got bored reading just a couple of days.
She said that it was worth it and denied being bored.
I sent another text to Alda, just sharing with her that I had started.

Around noon I had one of the bagels I bought yesterday with some peanut butter.
Tonight, I cooked the ground meat that I put down from the freezer yesterday.
I fried it with the sautéed vegetables.
I put some rice on the stove.
When everything was done, I made myself a burrito with some avocado hummus.
Half of the meat and three quarters of the rice remained as leftovers.
I had finished my burrito and put away the tupperwares when I noticed there
was an abandon lid.
I looked for its counterpart and could not find it until I remembered I
had put the potatoes in the microwave oven.
I did not finish them.

### Tuesday, February 20th, 2024
_Evitarte hace tiempo que yo intento; puedes decepcionarme.
Me doy cuenta que si hoy te trato poco te conservaré más tiempo._

Like other nights, the side effects of my medication tied me down to the bed
only to push me back to the world after a couple of hours.
The first time that I opened my eyes, it was 3h.
I stayed in bed for a while, but decided to give up trying to sleep around 4-5h.
I finally got up at 6h.
I did the morning routine without any bit of tiredness.
I did not take the walking route.
I waited 13 minutes for the 144 bus and got to the lab some time before 8h.
I passed through the empty offices and hallways before getting to my desk.
Vlad arrived a couple of hours later.
Neda a bit after noon.

I got finally the last material I needed to finish with the submission for the
HVR paper.
I did all of the changes to the manuscript,
wrote the bulletin points for the highlights of the research,
noted the contributions of each author,
and made a rough draft for the cover letter to the co-editors-in-chief of the
Medical Image Analysis journal.
I sent all of this to Louis.

I got a message that I thought I would never receive.
On Instagram, a representative for MUPSS finally replied to the message that
I had sent last week.
They told me I was now registered as a member and there was no need for me to
go to office hours.
In any case, I could just show up whenever someone was present,
unless I wanted to use the darkroom, in which case I should contact somebody.
I followed up asking for the film scanners and the payment.
The person replied fairly quickly to let me know the names of the people that
were best suited to help me with that.
I looked online for the schedule and found out that the best time for me to
go would be Thursday at 9h.
I have therapy at 10h, so I can go there early and pass before my session.
I will go to the lab and then meet with Aliza in the afternoon.
Thursday will be my most full day of the week.

I worked a bit on the PreventAD data, but by 14h I was exhausted mentally.
I kept thinking about going to _Dieu du ciel!_ with my laptop to start working
on editing the earliest entries of my journal.
I could also go and get me some gnocchis on the way home.

The idea was so seducing that I checked the timeschedule for the 144 bus that
would pass right outside the office.
I had to spend another 15 minutes before leaving and even that seemed like too much.
In those 15 minutes, I dropped that idea and settled on coming home,
picking up my laptop and working a couple of hours in ETOH brasserie,
with a glass of their strongest beer.

When I got to the metro station, I changed my mind once again.
Now I am sitting in front of the television, with New Girl on the background,
doing these words and feeling the effects of barely half of the last can of the
beers that I bought while Sonny was here.

I sent a text to Alda earlier today when I was in the lab,
on which I shared with her that I thought about asking her to do something,
but we probably wouldn't have enough time.
She told me we could certainly do something when she gets back and asked me
what I wanted from Turkey or Albania.

As I write this, I remember when I was a little kid and I would get excited
whenever my dad would go to some other country for work,
as that would mean he'd get me something from there.
I can't remember anything that he'd brought me except a cute blue watch with
sailboats on the strap.
I wore that watch for a long time when I was in elementary school.
I wonder what happened to it.

I looked into the schedules of the movies at both _cinéma du parc_ and
_cinéma moderne_.
With Sonny we were going to watch All of us strangers,
with Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott.
I looked for that one but they're not showing it anymore.
I'm tempted to going Sunday to see _Vampire humaniste cherche suicidaire consentant_.
I could get the gnocchis that I didn't get today and maybe carry my camera with me.

### Wednesday, February 21st, 2024
_Haven't had a dream in a long time.
See, the life I've had can make a good man bad.
So, for once in my life, let me have whom I want._

I woke up at a reasonable hour today.
Not too early, but not that late either.
I think I got out of bed around 9h or 10h.
Like other mornings, the first thing that I did was brew my coffee.
I did not sit to work while I drank it.
I put something on the television but can't remember what.

I've been watching New Girl still, but I'm starting to get tired of it.
I tried watching the pilot of Hazbin Hotel, or to pick up One day again.
Neither of those kept my attention for long.
I don't think I managed to finish a full single episode of either.

I weighted myself today but I didn't record it in the phone.
The numbers came back down from 80.
Hopefully they won't rise again.
I was 10 kilograms lighter when I liked my body.
I came to sit down and write these words after texting Sonny my decision to
skip today's pills in order to not have dinner.

It's not just about the food.
I despise the side effects.
I keep thinking back to those years ago and I am not fully convinced I ever
got a real hipomanic episode.
Aliza texted me after French class with a screenshot of a question posted in a
Facebook group asking about Dialectic Behavioral Therapy,
asking me if that was the kind of therapy that I wanted.
I told her how it is, despite the fact that it was created to treat
borderline personality disorder.
Apparently it has shown to be well-adapted to mood disorders,
and can be very useful for self-harm and substance abuse.
I mentioned that without explicitly saying that I've suffered from both of
those things.

Is my lack of eating another more subtle way of self-harm?

Today I actually sat down and started working on editing the journal.
I separated them into different files for the various years.
I was 17 years old when I started using the app to write these entries.
That first year I wrote in Spanish.
Almost none of those days are actually journal entries.
They are very short stories.
Not very good ones.

Translating them got too hard.
I jumped to the next year.
2015.
I was 22 years old.
I had just came back from Spain and was dealing with the recently resurfaced
issues with gender identity.
In the first day I talk about René suggesting antidepressants and it not
being the meds that I wanted.
I didn't get to that part but a couple of months later I would start taking
them the day of the graduation of my friend group.
Back then, the thought never cross my mind that years later I would stop
talking to all of them.

I finished just one or two days before I decided to jump again.
I moved to 2021, the first summer after I moved here.
I worked on that while the professor moved us to breakout rooms and my
teammates were still working on the exercise.
I could have continued working on managing the data that I still owe Louis,
but instead I kept editing my writings about meeting Molly and asking her out.
Months after we never went for that coffee, in October,
I would see her again at a Halloween party.
I even met her girlfriend who was also named Molly.

When I lived in Mexico City, inside a closet,
I made out with a Sofía and her future girlfriend.
Years later, in Montréal, I would go on a date once with a Sophia but
nothing would come out of it.
Now, despite dating for three years here,
Sophie is just the 5th girl with whom I've ever gone on a second date.

Tomorrow I will finally go to MUPSS.
This might be the third time that I go to that building.
Hopefully, this time someone will be there and this will be it.
I am taking the negatives in the backpack in case I have enough time.

I am also taking my laptop with me.
After my meeting with Louis, I agree to meet Aliza at Thomson house.
She told me today she had forgotten that she has an HBHL thing in the early evening.
We agreed to meet anyway before it.
Maybe I can stay at Thomson for a while and continue working on the editing.


### Thursday, February 22nd, 2024
_Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?
Remember how she said that we would meet again some sunny day?_

I skipped dinner last night.
Throughout the whole day, I ate nothing but a pita bread and some avocado hummus.
It was the first night that I skipped the antipsychotics since I've been
dealing with the heightened side effects.

I saw _The miseducation of Cameron Post_ while I did yesterday's entry.
I remember they showed it in Yaaj during one of their youth meetings.
For some reason I did not go that time.
Perhaps I was living in Querétaro during that time.
Maybe I just decided not to go.

I don't remember the time I finally decided to go to bed.
It was not as early as if I had taken the pills, but it was not too late either.
After all, I did have to get up early in the morning to come to McGill to
check out the MUPSS stuff.

I had my alarm at 7h45.
I woke up maybe 20-30 min before it would ring.
I did not fall back to sleep during that time, but I stayed in bed.

I am sitting in Thomson House and writing this in my laptop.
I just took a sip of my second pint of beer.
Aliza went downstairs for her HBHL event.
She might come back but did not make any promises.
Her event will last around 3h.

In the morning I put the negatives in my backpack together with my laptop.
I made some coffee despite knowing that I would not drink it in my office.
I took the orange line of the metro and then the 24 bus.
It was the third time that I walk towards the MUPSS office in the SSMU
building and it was also the third time that nobody was there.
The door was closed and locked.
For some reason it was extremely hard to knock.
In the end I sat at the table besides the door and had half of my coffee
before my therapy session at the building next door.

I told Aliza a few moments ago how my session didn't feel it was worth it
because I didn't cry.
I talked about my plan for not reaching out to Sophie again.
I talked about how I feel scared of the way I am feeling.
I try to hold back my mind from fantasizing about what could or could not happen.
I am not succeeding very much at it.

I am sitting two tables to the right from where we were sitting last week.
I keep glancing at the door as if she were to suddenly enter.

After my session with Calli I walked half of the way to the MNI.
The 144 bus was just passing as I was about to get to its stop.
I rushed to catch it and skipped the rest of the walk.

I worked for half of the day.
I waited for my meeting with Louis at 14h30.
Three minutes before, I grabbed my phone and walked towards his office.
The door was closed, so I sat on the chair besides it.
15, 20 minutes passed.
I could hear a foreign voice from inside, so I assumed they were on a call.
I did not have much to talk about so I decided against knocking.

"Sofia, if you are there, please come in", he finally said through the door.

I tried, but it was locked.
I let him know.
Neda came and opened it for me.

We talked about the material for submitting my first paper.
We went through his comments and changes.
Just as Neda took part of my time, I took part of Mohammedreza's.

When I got out I saw a message from Aliza saying she had gotten a table at Thomson.
I grabbed my stuff and came here.
I told her I was unsure about eating or not.
I went to the bar instead and got us two pints.
When the waiter came to offer us some food menus we declined.

She told me about Ali.
In the end, she's not coming to Montréal to visit her.
She seemed more convinced of the idea of breaking up.
Apparently, it's not just her.
Ali told her that their relationship was not working.
They're taking a break for one month.
From what Aliza was saying, I doubt their relationship is gonna survive after
this.
Aliza seems to be just waiting for her crisis to end so she can break up.

### Saturday, February 24th, 2024
_Está muy lleno y no sé qué hacer.
Estoy pensando que es_ too much.
_¿Vamos a otro lado?_
Yeah, _no puedo.
Me voy a salir._
I'm down _para ir a Benelux o Church, pero ahí no puedo._

I skipped yesterday's words.
I have no excuse, since I had time to do them after I came back.
I actively decided not to do them.
I don't care about the streaks, anymore.

Did I go to the lab?
No, I did not.
I woke up but I didn't do much work.
I had my coffee and was on my laptop for most of the day.
I've been working on editing the old journal entries.
Last night I was working on the days around Flore's disappearance.
Now it is a little funny how much importance I gave to a single first
date from a dating app.
I can't even remember the name of 75% of the girls I've gone out with.
I wouldn't imagine any of them remembering my name and writing about me in
their journals years later.

That is not totally fair.
Of course I would remember the first date I ever went on in a new country,
in English.
I remember the first date I ever went on in French.

I showered around 14h or 15h, but did not change.
I continued working on the journal.
When I decided to take a break I found the _All of us strangers_
movie on Disney+.
Was that really yesterday, though?

Whenever it was that I started it, I did not finish it.
I liked it well enough, but I could not concentrate.
I probably put on _New Girl_ again and continued changing the words
describing my first depressive episode in Montréal.

Yesterday I cut off my bangs.
I messed them up and panicked a little when I cut off too much from the
strands on the sides where the hair gets longer and fades with the rest.
From handling my hair so much it became frizzy and messy.
I wet my hair again trying to save it.
In the end it didn't look that bad.

I put on some make-up and felt fake.
I hated the way I looked.
I tried to take a picture to send to Sonny,
but I could not find an angle where I did not hated my look.
I think losing weight will help me with this feeling,
but not once did the thoughts in my head were I look too fat.

I had told Aliza I would had dinner before leaving,
but at the very end I changed my mind.
In the morning, with my cup of coffee, I had a bagel with peanut butter.
She pushed our meeting time to 20h, so I finally left my place at 19h15.

I wore the small earphones and listened to music the whole way to Verdun.
I walked towards Palco and entered.

_"Salut! Est-ce que tu viens á la soirée velours?
As-tu une réservation?
Ben, amuse-toi!"_

The place was packed.
I walked towards the bar and placed myself in front of the only empty stool
close to the end.
There was a guy with two glasses in front of him.
I didn't take the seat as I assumed it was from this stranger's companion.
Instead I took the menu and tried to hide in it.

_"Bien, llego en ~12 min"_, replied Aliza to me.

The music was too loud.
I saw people entering but could not follow where they'd go.
I walked towards the restroom to cover from the mixed sound of the music and
the crowd.
I stopped in front of the rack of coats and started texting Aliza.

A group of girls stepped in and stopped in front of the corner towards the restrooms.
One of them was a little startled after she passed by my side,
as she was probably not expecting me.
They were speaking in French, but I didn't follow what they were saying.

I decided to leave hoping that Aliza would understand.
I am not sure of that group of girls left before me, too,
or if they went upstairs to were the music was louder.

I walked out trying to avoid the eyes of the hostess who had welcomed me in.
I walked a little bit towards a small alley across the street of Benelux.
I don't remember if I put my earphones back before Aliza texted me again.

We found each other and decided to walk into Benelux.
I apologized to her but I couldn't tell if she was disappointed with what
had happened.

_"¿Tú no te sientes rara maquillada?
Me siento rara, pero no sé si es por ser lesbiana o por ser trans"_,
I had asked her before leaving my house.

We had a pint each and talked about the past.
We shared stories about our exes between talking about work.

The plans of meeting today with Liana had fallen through,
but we talked about meeting at her house to work.
I didn't make any promises since I had a couple of errands to run.
Earlier in the morning I had called to renew my prescriptions.
The gave me the option to picking them up that day or the next one.
Even though I could had passed before going to Verdun, I decided against it.

Before leaving, instead of dinner, I had a glass of the rest of the Amaretto
that Alda and I didn't drink with some grapefruit juice.
I was already drunk when I had gotten to Palco,
but that was not enough to calm my anxieties.

After she got herself a pretzel and before we left,
I ordered myself a glass of the strongest IPA they had.

There were some _ralentissements du service_ on the orange line,
but I made it home.
I considered for a bit ordering a subway from Alto,
but cooked some sausage with vegetables and fried eggs over rice instead.
I did not get a hangover this morning.
Still, I did not get up as early as I would have wanted.
It was still before noon, so I did have some coffee.
I did not have breakfast, still.
I actually haven't eating a single bite all day.
I wil lhave some salad before going to bed,
or more probably after finishing these words.

I finished the 30 minutes that I had left from _All of us strangers_.

That reminded me about buying the ticket for tomorrow's movie,
_Vampire humaniste cherche suicidaire consentant_.
It's at 11h, so I guess I will buy a coffee instead of a pint this time.

Somehow I had still a spiro pill left in the bottle,
thus I went first to la _buanderette_ rather than the pharmacy.
I took my laptop in the same bag as my underwear to keep working on the
journal while I was waiting for the machines to finish.

I didn't mind the walk, despite the cold.
Is this the first time that I have done laundry since Sonny left?
When I took out the red hoodie from its hanger in the closet,
one of her socks fell to the floor.

"U free?", I texted her earlier today, "I'm a little drunk and I miss u."

I came back from the laundry walking the same path that I took to get there,
yet, like always, it felt much shorter.
I left the bags of, now clean, clothes,
and with a different tote bag, took my way off again.

The first stop was _la fruiterie_.
I got myself a pepper, to cook with the minced beef;
a bag of celery, to cook with the cans of tuna that Sonny never had;
ham, to have with my salad; a bag of pita, and a bowl of chipotle hummus,
to have also with the ham as sandwiches.
There were no croutons.

Walking towards the pharmacy,
I decided to stop at the first Jean-Coutu in front of Station Jarry,
since they do sell some food and thus might have some in stock.
If they didn't I could still buy the toothbrush I need, anyway.
They did, so I bought both together with a big bottle of mouthwash.

From there I went to the second Jean-Coutu, the one that holds my prescriptions.
I walked towards the _caisses_, but the lady there called someone first.
She greeted my after finishing with their business.
I told her in French that I had called yesterday for my prescriptions and
later gave her my last name.
A different women brought me my medications.
Before giving them to me,
she told me that I would need to meet with the pharmacist.

I knew exactly what they wanted to talk to me about.
I waited around 2-3 minutes before a guy approached the counter to the side to
which I had moved.
After his greeting and question whether I'm still taking Lurasidone,
I asked him to continue in English.
I lied to him and told him that I had gotten some in Mexico after forgetting
them before my trip.

He seemed to buy it.
They're cheaper there, I added as an extra touch.
He asked me if I could buy them without a prescription over there,
and I just added that I had a psychiatrist friend,
calling back to the experience I had with the clonazepam.
I finished saying that I was still taking them,
but I would need to meet with my Dr soon, anyway,
to talk about modifying the dosage or changing the medication, anyway.
He finally gave me my hormones.
I bought a pack of toilet paper on my way out.

That was supposed to by my last stop for the day,
except I did an impromptu one at SAQ, where I got myself a bottle of vodka.
I haven't yet finished the drink I made with some of the grapefruit juice—that
now I can drink after suspending the antipsychotic medication—and
I am quite drunk.

### Sunday, February 25th, 2024
 _"Limerents gotta be limering."

"I'm limerencing."_

I had been doing a half-decent job of controlling my thoughts and feelings.
I'm sure that having been reading the way I used to feel three years ago had
something do to with it.
Since the very first girl that I asked on a date—which to be fair,
I'm not entirely sure that I did ask out explicitly—I've been putting so much
thought into the idea of connecting with someone.

Is it about being seen and accepted?

Then, why would Sonny's comments or the sincere appreciation I get from my
friends are not enough?

I had to wake up earlier today than any other usual Sunday.
My alarm at 9h15 was enough, but I could not sleep more than if I wanted to
get to the cinéma in time.
Like usual, I started waking up a couple of hours earlier.
There was a half-formed thought that would come up in those briefs moments
of consciousness.

I grabbed the phone and unlocked it.
I saw there was a red 1 uptop the messaging app and felt this exhilarating
bolt of energy.
I put my finger on there without a second thought.
The conversation at the very top was from a strange number.
A spam offer about the enterprise membership for Costco.

A couple of days ago I had sent Katherine a message asking her how she has
been after reading about how I met her years ago.
She had been having issues with her partner and would tell me a little about
it in our casual hang outs.
In her profile she had a picture where she was smiling on top of an ikea cart.
I think she was Rumanian.
After a couple of days without an answer, I deleted the conversation.
After deleting the latest spam, now the one on top is the latest message
from my mum telling me that I am actually not fat.

I showered and changed.
My hair looks weird to me but not necessarily in a bad way.
I might have cut the bangs too short, but they will grow faster than I think.
Sooner than later I'll be having hair on my eyes all over again.

I texted Sonny asking her if I should order my subway from Alto right now or
waiting until finishing the words.
I passed the command before her reply.
I considered getting a can of ginger ale or diet soda,
but decided against it at the last minute.
I did not have enough grapefruit juice for the amount of vodka I served myself,
but I have some bottles of ginger beer that will do just fine.

In the morning I considered taking my camera, but didn't.
I took the earphones instead of the headphones with my iPod.
I took the metro and got to _cinéma moderne_ with enough time to order
myself a coffee for the movie.
I approached the bar and started my order in French.
When she asked me for the size, I asked to see the different options.
Finally, she asked me if cow milk was alright for my latte,
but I didn't completely understand her.
I knew she was talking about milk, so I asked her if she had cow milk.
She got confused—or maybe annoyed—and clarified to me that she had exactly
asked me just that, if cow milk was OK.
I paid with my card and took the glass inside the theater.

I sat at the very edge of the row, right next to the wall.
Besides me there was a francophone couple.
I glimpsed at the guy's phone while he started texting his girlfriend with
cutesy phrases.

The same girl who served me my coffee came inside and presented the movie,
_Vampire humaniste cherche suicidaire consentant_.
It has win some awards in Europe and, besides being funny, it's also touching.
The movie started but the subtitles never appeared.
I had felt assured that it would have English subtitles.
While I am sure I missed some of the jokes and maybe some subtleties of the script,
I understood most of it despite the stronger québécois accent.

I felt like when I was a child and I would start watching the TV with my dad.
He would watch the channels from the antenna that came from California,
thus they didn't have subtitles except the closed captions.
Sometimes they would not work perfectly.

When the movie finished I walked a couple of streets and got me a box of gnocchis.
I ordered them in French and learned that chopsticks are called _des baguettes_.

Coming back home, I went to bed and took a nap.
I fell asleep thinking about the different possibilities of what will
happen whether Sophie texts back next week or not.

### Monday, February 26th, 2024
"Salut Sofia !
Seras-tu à l'après-midi demain vers 3-4pm? [...]
Je passe chex tout le monde pour faire le point voir les apts,
parler renouvellement, faire petit cadeau et papiers impôts"

I skipped the alarm this morning.
I lacked the energy to start the day.
Vicky had sent the zoom links for the meetings with Raphael and Sasha.
The latter was at 10h30.
For the former I was confused if it would be at 9h or 12h,
given the time difference with San Francisco.

Daniel had said that the Neuro meeting was cancelled.
He sent us the information for a talk from an alumni of Louis.

Since yesterday, I knew that I would stay home instead of going to the laboratory.
Now that I think of it, that was not the best idea.

Last night I finished the subway and fries that I got from Alto.
I did not serve myself more alcohol, but what I had was more than enough.

I went to bed and browsed my phone like I usually do.
On TikTok, sometimes I get a notification suggesting to send something to Alda.
Months ago, I would get the suggestion of adding the account of my
landlord's dancing school.
Last night, the short-videos were intermitted by a suggestion page of an
account that I might know.
It was called notagoldenretriever and the profile picture was a cat with a
half-brown-half-gray face sitting on somebody's lap.
The very second that I had the impulse to pass it,
I recognized the divisory line of colour on the cats face.
I went back to Sophie's conversation and opened one of the pictures she sent me.
It was a match.

Again I had a deceptive notification on the messages app when I woke up.

I got up from bed with time enough to make myself coffee before the meeting with Sasha.
Louis had told us to schedule meetings with her.
I sat in front of my chair with my mug and put on my headphones.
As soon as I turned them on, the electronic voice told me that the battery was insufficient.
I put them to charge and drafted an e-mail to Sasha inviting her to meet some time this week.

She replied fairly quickly telling me she was going to meet Reza and Daniel
tomorrow and the next day at 10h.
I could either meet her on my own or join any of those two meetings.
I told her that whatever she preferred was good for me,
but she never got back with a response or a link.

After I finished my coffee, I weighted myself.
I gained weight again.

I tried to watch _One day_ again, but couldn't get into it.

I kept working on the journal.
It's getting more and more depresing.
I probably should stop.

In the afternoon, I could not hold my hunger and made myself a pita sandwich.
I haven't eaten again yet.
As soon as I finish these words I will make myself the salad.
There's still a package of minced meat that I need to cook.
I will do that tomorrow.

My back is hurting.
It's been hurting since French class.
The professor asked me how I was doing.
I replied saying _moyen_, but didn't want to get into details.
I could have talked about going yesterday to the movies and watching my first
movie in french without any type of subtitles.

Instead of starting an activity the prof put on a small audio segment from
radio canada about Olha, one of our classmates.
She's an ukranian refugee who came to Québec two years ago escaping the
conflict with Russia.
Her late husband died in one of the bombings.

All day I've struggled not to send a message.

It'd feel really nice if she looked me up for once.
I don't wanna take that away from myself by texting her first.

She might have returned today from her trip.
When I came back from the holidays, I texted her the same night of my arrival.

She's not me.
She's not as interested in me as I am in her.

That's OK.

I had told Alda that I wanted to wait until her return before sending anything.

The last time I reached out to Sophie was to ask her out before her trip.
She was the one who brought up meeting after her trip.
I explicitly ask her to text me when she came back.

It's on her now to do it.
I should not want to meet her if I have to beg her for it.

### Tuesday, February 27th, 2024
"Salut, Sofia, tu vas bien ? Tu as l'air en forme !"

It was one of those nights.
Not that bad going to sleep, but I was awake at 3h.
I don't think I slept well after that.
Not that I didn't try.

I was on my phone for a while.
It was frustrating, but not like some years ago or back when I first started
taking the antipsychotics.

Calli told me once about just letting go and be conscious that any kind of rest,
even if I don't fully fall asleep, is better than no rest.

I am not sure at what time I ended getting up.
I remember I saw the sun slipping through the drapes.
It was not much after that.

I started the morning with my coffee.
I sat in front of the television and continued working on the journal entries
of this year with _One day_ playing on the background.
I payed more attention this time.
It was not enough, though, as I had to go back a couple of times and I did
quit mid-episode.

When I was in bed I got a response from Sasha.
She said that because I'm from IPN,
she might have some specific questions about the program.
It would be better to have a 1:1 session with just me.
She proposed to meet after her time with Reza.
I replied around 4h or 5h, that I would send her a zoom link later in the day.

All morning I've not been able to avoid opening up the messaging app.
I saw Sophie's warning of disabled notifications disappear with the sunrise
and come back in the early morning.
The first half of the day I was hurting the assumed rejection from her silence.

I am aware of how irrational it is, but that doesn't really help.

Writing about the past few weeks did, a little bit.
Whenever I feel sad about the idea of her never reaching out,
I try to think back about how I still have to come out of the closet with her.
If I don't see her again, I won't have to go through the anxiety of hearing
how my body is a dealbreaker.

In my worst phases during the day, I would think about her meeting somebody.
Someone with whom she went out the weekend before her trip when she was all
scheduled up.
The person with whom she kept texting while she was away.
Someone sweet and charming, secure of herself. Somebody cis.

On our first date two months ago,
I asked her whether I was her first date after her breakup.
Her answer was vague.
It was not a yes, but it would have been so easy to just say no.
I told her that she would have lots of experiences while I was away from Canada.
We joked that she'd make a list of the most important bullet points from her encounters.

Is this jealousy?
I don't feel possesive of a girl I've just gone on two dates with.
I feel intimidated by the idea that, while I'm here writing of her,
she's somewhere thinking about somebody else, someone better.

I felt bad about reaching out to Tirza whenever I would feel disappointed with
Sophie.
I was glad that I didn't see Tirza again.
I realized that I whatever relationship—however short or casual it were—would
be tainted by the unhealthiness of how it began.
Maybe I could use a thought like this one whenever I want to reach out to
Sophie again.

Around noon, when her disabled notifications banner never came back,
I realized that eight days in Ottawa, if she had left on Monday,
would mean that she's coming back today.
I texted her the same night of my arrival to Montréal.
I never expected her to do the same.

My thoughts feel clumsy and shapeless.
I can't put into clear words the mess that are my emotions right now.

I texted Sonny to tell her that I hadn't called to make the appointment with
the psychiatrist.

"Hoy hazlo", she said.

And I did.
I will see him next Thursday before noon.

I sent the e-mail to the psych clinic that Aliza referred to me.
They replied while I was in French class,
but each session costs 1000 MXN without taxes.
I replied to them in a brief e-mail that it was out of my budget.

Around 16h the landlord came.
I asked him to switch to English.
He is increasing the rent 50 CADs next year.

I checked on the McGill website and saw the minimum stipend is increased
yet again for 2024.
I need to talk with Louis about increasing mine again.

### Wednesday, February 28th, 2024
"If I do text, it doesn't mean I failed, right?
Expressing how I feel is not wrong, is it?"

I really feel like taking a drink.
I'm considering getting up from the couch,
leaving incendies playing on the TV, and making it.

Drinking when sad is not healthy.
It is one of the things I listed to Sonny when I talked about possible issues
I could work on in therapy.

The first thought that crossed my mind when I got up was that I shouldn't have eaten.
I don't think it will matter much.
The drink tastes strong.

This morning I had no trouble sleeping.
I turned off the alarm and stayed comfortably asleep until around 9h.

I was sure I would not be going to the lab today either.
I had the meeting with Sasha around 10h.
I did not shower for it.

She reminded me of Laurie-Eve, the girl who took over my room at _des Pins_.
She is an IPN student interviewing for a PhD position at the lab.
She applied for rotations, but was rejected from it.
We talked about Louis,
how it feels being an outsider in a room full of engineers,
and the introvertedness and asocial atmosphere of the lab.

I had scheduled the meeting in Zoom from 10h30 to 11h.
At 10h58, she started closing up by thanking me and saying she'd let me
continue with my work.

I worked most of the morning.
I left the script extracting the files and converting to MNC running.
I went to bed and cuddled with my thoughts.

At _des Pins_, they informed them of a 5% rent increase which they denied.
They lowered it down to 4.7%, but they still refused.
They would let the TAL sort it out.
I told Alda how I was sure they are not gonna win,
since in the table the TAL itself released out was stated a 4.6% increase for
electricity-heated dwellings.
I warned her that, if the TAL sides with the landlord,
it's possible that they themselves have to pay for the legal fees.
Later, after browsing reddit,
I shared with her the cautions about being blacklisted by landlords for having
opened a dossier in a _fixation du loyer_ proceeding.

She might have gotten nervous with what I told her,
as she later said she was considering backing out.
They were gonna file it today.
She did not know if she had time.

The notice of disabled notifications never appeared on Sophie's conversation.
The idea of sending the image of her cat as a suggested person in my phone
kept coming back.

2 years ago I saw a story of Kate that showed her wearing the same sweater
she wore on our second date.
I remember the rainbow-coloured edge of its sleeve peeking under her coat
when she placed her hand on my arm as she approached to kiss me.
I felt this same urge back then to share this recognition.

I made myself some breakfast in the early afternoon.

_I'm thinking of you_, was one of the things I sent 2 years ago.

I am starting, now, to feel the dreaded side effects of the medication that I
was prescribed precisely for those same impulses.

"_Creo que hoy le voy a terminar mandando mensaje.
Aún no lo hago y ya me estoy sintiendo rara_", I sent to Sonny.
"_Tú, ¿qué harías en mi lugar?_"

"_Dejarlo morir, la verdad._"

I didn't listen as I tend not to.

Before French, at 17H50, I sent her the picture with the words
_Look who showed up in my phone when I was procrastinating._

When class started, I put on the do not disturb feature that I never use.
Everytime that it activates automatically when I go to the lab, I,
purposefully, shut it down.
I do not know what was my thought process.

I disabled it 30 minutes after the class had started.
There were no notifications.

I opened up the conversation and saw it was seen at 18H19.

There are still no new notifications.

I don't know what I wanted but this was not it.

I am starting to feel the effect of the alcohol, the medication, or the interaction of both.
My glass is still not empty.
I need to wait another week before I see the psychiatrist.
Will I let him know about this?

I am not so sure I will go to the lab tomorrow.
It would do me good to get out of the house, distract myself.
I don't seem to have the energy nor the will to do so.

### Thursday, February 29th, 2024
"She might reply later or during the weekend, but still,
I don't think this is doing me any good...
I guess I deserve to go out with someone who also gets excited to be with me."

This is not the first time that I make use of the feature of writing after midnight.
It's 4h37, right now.
My head is hurting and I'm lying in bed,
with a pillow under my chest and the laptop where my head should be.

I didn't get up early today—last morning.
The temperature dropped from 14°C to -12°C.
I could hear the wind whistling.
I decided that I could continue staying home as I've been doing the whole week.

I showered around noon.

I had my coffee and a bagel with peanut butter.

I finished working on the scripts and re-run them on the second two years.
This time I caught the errors.

I am now extracting the metadata for the next three years.
I should be getting done with this before the end of next week.

I finished the Incendies movie.
I liked it.
I gasped just like the protagonist did.

All day I was deleting and restoring the conversations in my messaging app.
I was closed to deleting the contacts of Sophie together with all the other
women I have gone out but whom I will never see again.

I finished editing the journal entry of the summer of 2023, the night I met Alexia.
Even as I am writing this, I realize how it meant a lot more to me than it surely did for her.
I don't know why the thought doesn't bother me as much as I'd thought it would.

I had my meeting with Louis in the early afternoon.
He didn't mind my staying home.
We talked about the data, the manuscripts and Sasha.
He mentioned the lab lunch tomorrow.
I had completely forgotten about it.
I know I put it down in my calendar,
yet I am not sure I would have remembered it had he not brought it up.

Alda has finished _Normal People_.
She asked me for other romance books, but I couldn't recommend any to her.

I mentioned how I find it hard to relate to romance stories.
I looked online and downloaded two books.
I started _Pages for you_.

I gave up on the other book I was reading.

I served me a glass of vodka with ginger beer, supposedly to drink while I read,
but I ended up putting a movie instead.

I have a 7-day trial of Starz channel on Amazon Prime.
I put on _Before Sunrise_.
I found the actress Julie Delpy adorable.

It was hard not to relate to this movie.
As soon as it finished, I put on the sequel _Before Sunset_.

I served myself a second glass for the second movie.
I knew they would not meet again six months later in Vienna like they planned.

I reheated my meat and rice and had it for dinner.

The end of the sequel broke me.
I cried like I never usually do with movies.

I feel like throwing up.
I think I'll get up to the restroom and to drink more water.

I have still another hour to finish 200 more words.

I couldn't throw up.
I'm nauseous and my head is still hurting.

In the morning, before showering I weighted myself.
The scale showed 78.
kg. This is the lowest I've weighted all year.

Later in the day, after going to the restroom,
when I wiped I saw red on the toilet paper.
It was not the spots that sometimes appear making me suspect of hemorrhoids.
The paper was mostly red.

If it happens again, I might need to be concerned.

I did not finish the third movie of the trilogy.
I was seeing double and the pills that I've started taking again made me want to go to bed.
I think it was during this one when my watch vibrated and I saw Sophie's
name next to the cat emoji.

I read the message on the small screen and discarded the notification.
I have not replied to it.

I am debating the idea of getting up now or going back to bed—to sleep,
I am in bed right now.
I need to get up again to put the laptop back.
I guess I could just leave it on the header of the bed.
My hurting head won't let me fall asleep again, but if I don't at least try,
I'll regret it the rest of the day.

"Ahaha oh wow, my top secret tiktok account." Says the message I ignored.

/newpage
## March, 2024

### Friday, March 1st, 2024
"lol 'top secret' with +1k followers.
I mean, I get it, she's the second cutests thing on the island."

There is a different kind of sadness around me.
I think people could notice.

I wanted to throw up all morning.
I tried a couple of times after finishing the words in the very early morning.
I stayed in bed, resting, until the sun came out.

I thought I could fall asleep again at 7h or 8h.
I changed the alarm to 10h and enjoyed my well-deserved rest.

I texted Sophie even though I told Aliza that I wouldn't do it.
I waited until there were no disabled notification notice, for some reason.
I didn't want to send it at a weird hour of the morning.
I waited until around 6h45.

I tried not to open the conversation again as I knew I would get overfixated
on when she would read it and what would that mean.

She read it at 8h.

I deleted the conversation definitely again.

I can't remember if I showered or had my coffee first.
I had enough time to drink it calmly.
I decided against finishing the last 40 minutes of the movie.
I think I just sat on the couch hearing music.

I put on my headphones and left the apartment.
I was the first person to arrive at the korean restaurant.
I thought it would be the same old place downstairs,
but this time it was on the main floor.

I asked the waitress if they had a reservation for a large group of people and
she let me know that the table was ready.

I sat on the very corner.

Vlad was the second one to arrive.
He sat in front of me.
Daniel and Reza came up next.
Then Victoria and Daniel D.
Finally the rest of the lab came.

There is something about Daniel that shuts me off.
It's not him, he directly asked me how I was doing and what is happening in my life.
I answered him succintly and chose to remain silent for the rest of lunch.
I wanted to close my eyes and sleep right there.

I ordered a plate of takoyaki and a bowl of pork ramen.
I was still hungover and wasn't that hungry.
If Louis were not to pay for my food,
I would have been satisfied with just the appetizer.

After eating, we took our way back.
I could have left like Vlad and Daniel did.
The metro was right there.
I walked back to the MNI.
I don't think I said a single word the whole way.

We entered through the hospital's main entrance.

I worked in the office for around two hours.
I set up and left running three years that have already run.
I wished Neda a nice weekend, took my stuff and left.

When I was leaving the MNI, I saw Daniel and Vicky walking.
They took the exit at _des Pins_.
I walked through the stadium and got out at Parc.

Was I intentionally avoiding them?

I walked all the way to station Sherbrooke.
I had thought about passing by _la fruiterie_ and getting some pita, hummus,
and a tomato.
I walked directly to my apartment.

I considered not eating anymore for the rest of the day.
Right now I keep looking at the time.
Maybe I can have a bagel.

I keep looking at the time for a different reason.
Last night she texted at 21h45.
Will she wait another day before texting back?

Will she reply at all?

Life is the stuff that happens while I wait for a stupid text.

The first thing that I did when I got home was putting the rest of
_Before Midnight_.

With this one I didn't cry.
I think the second one, _Before Sunset_, was my favourite of the three.
Maybe because the characters are my age.
Maybe it's because it's about reencounters and memories.

I started craving the burger from Thomson House.

In the afernoon I put on _La la land_.
That one also made me cry.
I think it was Mia's speech about not being enough.
Maybe it was her audition for the movie.

Last night before the notification on my watch
I was starting to be comfortable with the idea of letting go.

Before I replied, I kept thinking about what I could say next.
Possible suggestions of things to do:
the brunch that never started,
dinner at Lola Rosa after work,
Trauma bonding, the drinking game at a wine bar with a bottle of red winter wine,
watching one of our favourite lesbian movies in one of our apartments.

### Sunday, March 3rd, 2024
_But now you gotta do somethin' special for me.
I'm gonna say what's on my mind, then I'll walk out, then I'll feel fine._

_Yeah, I'm under his thumb, I'm on his back.
I will not show my teeth too quick._

The plan yesterday was to go out with Aliza for _la nuit blanche_ here in the city.
We had talked about doing something this weekend—the original plan was going
to a café and work for a bit, maybe chatting.
Friday was when she mentioned the cultural night in the city when even
the transportation runs all night.
There were going to be festivals and djs and all sorts of stuff.

During my three years in the city, I don't think I've ever been.
Last year she, accidentally, was out during that night with Vlad.
Two years ago, I think I saw a story from Kate being out with her probably
mexican friend.
It might had been during this event.

I've been waking up too early.
Yesterday was no exception.

At 7h I texted Aliza letting her know that I, again,
had been awake since 4h and to confirm she had asked for us to not go out very early.
Our final idea after talking about _la nuit blanche_ was to both go to a café
during the day and then move to look up for something interesting to do.

I think I did get up around that time to start the morning watching something
and drinking my coffee.

By 10h that she had replied, I had already gotten back under the covers.
I probably slept for another hour or two.

We had agreed to meet at 15h at _Lili & Oli_ on _Rue Wellington_.

Either yesterday or the day before I started getting the antipsychotic's
anguish feeling from the morning, so much that it made me wonder if I had
accidentally mistaken the medications.

I didn't feel comfortable and felt this urge to be moving, to do something.
I grabbed my stuff and left my apartment.
I took my camera, my laptop and my kindle.
At first I walked through _Rue Mistral_ with my camera strapped to my wrist.
Halfway, I placed it inside my backpack.
I concentrated on listening to music;
being outside my house and being outside my head.

I got to station Jarry.
I saw two or three shots that I could had taken.
I am sure I would have loved them.

I sat on one of the benches inside the station and saw the train arrive.
People stood up and waited for the the ones inside to exit through the doors.
I saw the light on the edges of the opening change from green to red.
The doors closed and the train left.
I did not move.

The second train arrived and I was tempted to stay moveless again,
but this time I took it.

I got the Verdun not as early as I thought I would be arriving.
I climbed up the stairs at _de l'Eglise_.
I was exhausted by the time I got off the station.

I walked calmly in the direction of the café.
It was rainning but for some reason I did not get wet.

When I got to the café, there was a line to order.
The place seemed full and I started getting social anxiety about what to do.
I considered texting Aliza about the situation and proposing moving to another place.

I didn't.

When there was only another person in front of me,
the cashier asked how he could help me while she was paying with her credit card.
It was also a CIBC credit card.
They payment was not processed correctly the first time she tried to tap.

"Je vais prendre un grand latté, STP, avec du lait d'amandes."

"Pour ici ou pour emporter ?"

"Pour ici."

He communicated my order to the other barista and I waited in place for him to
send the charge to the terminal.
I looked around for any possible place where we could sit.
There didn't seem to be any.

When my coffee was ready,
I grabbed my cup and took it with me to an empty spot in a bar.

I saw there were two possible seats on the communal table,
one in front of each other,
in the very middle of four separate people on their laptops.

I put my stuff over there.
The lady on the 2-person table behind where I would sit got up and starting
putting her things on her backpack.

I went to leave my coat on the hangers in the back.
I waited subtly for her to go.
She finished with her backpack and went to her coat.
She stopped to look at the papers in the bulletin board by the restrooms.

She finally left and I finally sat.
I was on the very corner of the café.
I could look at almost everyone inside.

In the morning, I went through my contacts and deleted most of them.
All of the stranded phone numbers from the failed dates.
All those unfruitful connections and gentle rejections.
All of the silent, abandoned bridges.
I saw some names that I could no longer associate to a face.
Among them there went Sophie.

Nine. Seven. Four.
That's all I needed to remember to get back to her, to keep the obsession alive.
Three digits and a pattern was the only key necessary.

I resuscitated her two times before deleting her again and letting her stay out of reach.

Whenever I would open the messaging app and type in her number manually on the recipient field,
my phone would automatically name the forgotten number as if to mock me.

Aliza got in and she sat in front of me.
We worked and we talked.
I continued with the PreventAD data and she got busy with the slides for her
presentation next week.

I mentioned to Aliza that I had realized that my text was wrong—I mistook
_Suivis_ with Followers.
I shared with her how I had the burning itch to let her know I had come to
realize my mistake.

She pointed out the obvious in how we both knew that this stupid thing was
not the reason why I wanted to talk to her, but only my justification for it.

I got sick of supervising my scripts.
I took out my Kindle and continued reading the book I've just started.
It's about this college freshman how starts falling for her TA.

Once during the night,
I turned and looked at the toddlers that were playing on the coffee table in
the middle of the café.
The first one was blonde, not older than 3.
She wore pink and was wearing the smallest beanie I've ever seen.
The other one was around the same age,
but with dark brown hair tied in a messy ponytail.

I looked at them and it hurt.
I thought about children and motherhood.
I felt the hole in my future that will never be filled.

I don't think Aliza saw me.
If she did, she said nothing about it.

We dismissed our original plans of going out and decided to go to her home
and watch a movie.
First we put on _New girl_ while we chatted.
We continued talking about therapy, our time in college;
Ali and her ex, my immature crush.

We decided to look for a movie and maybe order some food.
We were between getting a burger from _Notre boeuf de grace_ or something
from _Station Berlin_.

I got myself a Dönner and she ordered wings.
We settled on watching Bottoms.

In the middle of the movie I got a notification from Whatsapp,
it was a message from my dad.
He was asking me how I was doing.
I read it and starting getting nervous.
Usually it's my mum who reaches out.
What if something had happened?

In my head I started imagining the scene of Nymeria getting sick or suddenly dying.
My mum would not be able to tell me and she would ask my dad to give me the bad news.
Then it was just not my dog.
What if something happened to my mum or one of my siblings?
Was that how he would reach out?
How else would he do it?

In the end, he wanted to ask me about the recent visa changes for mexicans
and if that would affect me.
We talked for a bit and the fact that I have to go to Mexico soon to get my
wisdom teeth out got brought up.

Aliza finally kicked me out—in the most suble and gentle way
possible—30 minutes after midnight.

I took the 108 bus and the metro home.
There were people wandering around still.
I wondered if Sophie would have been among the people out enjoying the special night.

This morning, on the couch, I typed again the memorized phone number on the
app but this time it remained unchanged.
I felt a sudden prick of panic and wondered if I had already forgotten it.

Nine. Seven. Four.

_You're back in Montréal, right? Did you go out last night for la nuit blanche?_

...

_Hey, I really want to see you. Can I take you out to grab dinner or a drink someday this week?_

...

_You know, I used to miss having a crush. I'm not really enjoying it right now, to be honest._

...

_"Hey Sofia! I'm back in Montreal if you want to do something, maybe grab a meal?"_

...

_"Hey Sofia! Sorry for not texting back.
I had a great time meeting you,
but after some thought I think we're looking for different things.
I'm sorry. I wish you the best."_

...

_"You're back in Montréal, right?
Can I take you out to grab dinner or a drink someday this week?"_

_"Hey Sofia!
Sorry for not replying.
I'm really sorry, but I don't think I want to continue seeing you.
You're an amazing person, but I just don't feel a romantic connection."_

...

_"Hi! I would love to, unfortunately I'm pretty busy with work this week."_

...

_"Hey! Sure I would love to see you. When are you free?"_

### Monday, March 4th, 2024
_I need you now.
Can't you just love me or leave me?
I figured it out.
Like to be trapped in the feeling.
I feel it now.
Pain.
'Cause I can't help turning my love into pain._
-Pain, King Princess.

Yesterday, I managed to contain myself and at the same time I didn't.

Like the day before, I had this strange impulse of not being able to stay in the house.
I stood up from the couch and went to my room to put on some clothes.
I wore the same outfit as the day before.
I grabbed my kindle, my headphones, my phone, keys and wallet.
I left intoxicated with the thoughts of what could be.

"Salí a caminar, necesito pensar y/o sentir lo que siento." I sent to Aliza.

My first intentions were to just wander around.
By the corner of the fire station in St-Hubert,
I was already thinking of the different possible things I could send to Sophie
to break the silence and her potential responses.

I turned left towards Parc Villeray.

I imagined myself waking up early in the morning,
putting on some sports clothes, and coming to jog there.
There were some people doing just that.

I walked inside the park.
I thought about the urge of inviting Sophie to see her again this week,
as a decisive way of ending this obsession.

I continued towards east,
passing through le toasteur where she never showed up, and café nocturne,
where I ended up going that same morning.
I continued walking while I was thinking of how she would reject, evade, or accept my latest advances.

I ended up going to Café velours.
I went inside and ordered myself a _chaï maison_.
I sat first in the communal table, before moving to a couch.

I took my kindle out, but almost read nothing from it.

I looked towards the tables in front of me.
In one of them I sat and had one of the dates in French from last year.
She was a québécoise girl who sells tea at marché Jean-Talon and takes film pictures.
She vacously invited me to see each other again, albeit platonically.
I don't remember if, like with many other girls before her,
I actually followed up with it just to never get a response.

I forgot her name and I don't have her number anymore.

I saw a familiar face.
She looked directly at me and, unconsciously, I smiled an instant before recognizing her.

We had met at Dieu du ciel!, I waited for her on the terrace.
We had each a beer while we chatted.
She used to do cartoons for The New Yorker,
and had a column where she talked about disability and accessibility.
Talking about her with Alda, I nicknamed her Sparky, like the cartoonist who created Peanuts.
When I told Aliza, I apologized explaining that I didn't remember her name.

Her name is Gabrielle.

I was not sure it was her.
I doubted even more when the group of girls who came in with her sat on the
couches to my left and started speaking in French.
I didn't want to turn and risk making her uncomfortable.

"Is it weird that I am already thinking about where I can take you out next time."
I had written that last time.

"You're a great person, but I think we're looking for different things."
Was her response a couple of days later.

Not much later, I drank the rest of my glass of tea and took my stuff.
On my way out, I saw her seating in a different table all by herself.
I caught a last glance before leaving.

I walked to Parc Jarry and stayed there walking around for maybe an hour,
getting my body and my mind tired.

It was too late to make the stop at _la fruiterie_.
Instead, I walked all the way to where I started my journey and continued to IGA.
I bought some food and returned, finally, home.

"I feel sad, and frustrated, and defeated.

"Defeated 'cuz I know I'm gonna do it,
frustrated 'cuz I know I can't stop it,
and sad 'cuz I'm already feeling bad about it."

This morning I decided not to go to the lab.
There was an e-mail from Louis,
saying he'd work from home today and that all progress meetings this week
would be cancelled.

I had resigned myself with the idea that I would send out the invitation to
Sophie today.
Either I would get a meeting with her, or I would get a clear rejection.
It was the best way to put an end to all of this.

All day, while the PreventAD are running in the background,
I've been working on the journal,
editing the days since my very first meeting with Kate and the start of that obsession.

It's 21h28, just a couple of minutes I think,
before Sophie turns off her notifications again for the day.

I've managed to avoid sending the text that one half of me is desperate to do
while the other is dreading it.

At least for another day.

### Tuesday, March 5th, 2024
"Hey, I'd like to see you..."

I've been postponing writing these words.
The pills started wearing me down an hour ago when I finished the movie.
I lost count of the times that I considered just skipping them and going to bed.

I went to the lab today.
Louis asked us to.
Some potential new student would pass by to talk with us.
About the lab, the program, our research, and Louis.

I know I dreamed something, but I don't remember a single thing about it.

I postponed the alarm but didn't sleep much more.

I was still in bed when I grabbed my phone and I started typing the message
on a now empty conversation.

I knew what I wanted to say.
I was pretty sure that I wanted to do it.
I saw the time.
At around 8h20 I sent it out and pushed my phone the fuck away from me.

I stood up and started getting ready for the day.
I didn't want to check if she had seen it.
I didn't want to read as soon as I would get it.

I showered and changed.
When I returned from the restroom, a response was already waiting for me.
The first thing I saw was the blue heart after her greeting.

"Hey! that would be lovely.
I think I've got a drink in my budget for sure haha.
When are you free?"

I told her not to worry about the money, I was inviting her.
Instead of risking her being busy,
I proposed to her that she could pick the time and I'd pick the place.

I brewed my coffee and grabbed my stuff.
I walked to the metro.
There is construction right outside station Jarry.
I rode it just to Sherbrooke.

I walked the rest of the way.
I had forgotten that since today, the 144 bus would not pass through
_des Pins_ anymore, in any case.

Even after the long walk, I was the first person to arrive at the office.
Neda was the second.

I stood up to my bedroom looking for the business card that the researcher
from across the office had given me.
I can't remember his name.
He came and talked to us.
Neda asked him about the sell of his camera.
He's selling a Leica body, ~8k USD.
I responded in some way that made him ask me if I knew about photography.

"Oh, yeah. She's a photographer!" Neda pleaded for me.

Vlad came by not much after. Daniel was the last one.

At around 14h, Louis came with—what was name again?
We talked about all the things we were supposed to talk about.

When he left we continued talking among ourselves.
Daniel asked us if we planned on working this week.
I lied and told him I was—not as much as usual, but still a little.
He confessed he was not going to.

I considered going to the lab tomorrow again.
I could make a stop at the photography club.
Give it a one last try before giving up on it for good.
I don't think I will.

My head still feels weird.
I just want to get these words out of the way.

I texted Aliza asking her if we could do something Thursday after her class,
completely forgetting that there are no classes this week.
She told me she had an event for jewish grad students that day in any case.
After I asked her, she told me she would be going to the lab all days of this week.

I came back home early.
I walked the same way on my way back.

No, that's not true.
Instead of going through the way I entered besides the parking next to McGill's Gym,
I walked out from the corridors of the stadium out to _du Parc_.

I could not wait until after class and I had some of my tuna salad from yesterday.
I put on _Before sunrise_.
I wanted to watch it again before cancelling my free trial of the Starz channel.
I should do that right after these words.

In French class, we did the practice exam for oral comprehension.
It was the exact same videos we did last year at EMULCQ.
That exercise did not warranted the 3 hours of class.
The first half an hour was spent talking about possible things to do on our last day.
They mentioned going to a place to play bowling.
It's pretty far away in La Salle.

When the class ended, I put on _Before sunset_.

### Wednesday, March 6th, 2024
_I fall in love so easily because half of the relationship is in my head._
-Jules; Euphoria

Yesterday that I walked to take the metro on my way to the lab,
passing through Mistral, that quote of Euphoria passed through my head.
She is sitting on the couch in front of her therapist in the middle of a therapy session.
I could not remember from where I had gotten it.
During the night, when I sat to write in my journal,
I looked for it online but couldn't find it.

In the middle of French class, as I was editing the months of 2022—the times
after Kate's obsession and the months drowning my mental issues with alcohol
and fruitless dates—I read it as one of the prologues on a day of Frebruary.

The connections between that phase two years ago and now keep reappearing.

I stayed in bed this morning.
I had considered, like I told Aliza,
going to the lab today and passing through MUPSS.
I turned off the alarm without thinking.
I stayed in bed for a couple of hours before coming out and starting the day.

I did do some work.
I finished now with the remaining years from the ipl29 disk,
and prepared all the code needed for starting with 2020-2023 that reside
on ipl28.

Waiting for the scripts to run, like I've been doing these days,
I continue working on the journal.
I finished with the year 2022.

I am not sure how I feel.
It is hard, as I've written before, to be back to that state of mind.

Writing these now, the idea crossed my mind if I've always felt this depressed.
Broken.

I am meeting Dr Frank tomorrow morning.
I feel nervous about bringing up my dissatisfaction with the medication.
I want to lie and say that everything is well and just keep flirting with the
temptation of dropping the meds altogether.
Should I talk about my concerns of having been misdiagnosed?
Reading through those days where I supposedly was going through a manic episode,
I can see also the familiar signs of depression.

He doesn't know about my history of self-harm.
Still, other than my excruciating fear of abandonment,
I don't have any of the other characteristic signs of BPD.

In the morning I told to Alda about my date this week.
She was supposed to come back on Friday, too,
but I think she said she was returning earlier.

We talked a bit about dating.
She misses it.

"I feel kinda lonely.
I want someone to talk to and spend time in bed with.
Lol, is that why people date?" She sent me.

She still feels hesitant.
We talked about starting back again together in the summer.
I have deleted the apps since the beginning of the year.
I planned not to picking them up again until I feel better with my own body.
I had set the goal of being 72kg,
but probably will do it in the summer even if I don't reach that weight.

"Oye, ¿con quién es tu cita?"
That was the text from Sonny that awaited for me when I finally woke up.

I have been avoiding thinking too much about Sophie and our meeting the day
after tomorrow.

Last night I sent her the last text after finshing French class,
12 hours after I had said to her I would reach back.

"We already had beers,
let's change it a bit—I remember you saying you were a scotch girl.
Let's go to N sur Mackay."

After answering Sonny's question,
I shared with her how I felt a bit disappointed when she accepted my invitation.
Part of me wanted to put an end to this crush with her rejection.
Now that we have another date,
I keep fearing the eventual disapointment that I'll face when I somehow let her down.

I reviewed in my head the possible scenarios that can happen this Friday.
The potential questions that I could throw at her whenever the conversation turns dry.
The stuff that I want to know, to hear from her.

I don't understand.
I feel nervous about having to tell her that I am trans.
I fear saying it out load after arriving to the bar and having to see the reaction of her face,
hearing her gentle rejection followed by an over-explanation.

"Pues es la tercera vez que se verán."

She could have rejected me.
She could have disappeared.

But she didn't reach out.
It was me who looked for her, who reached out and pulled her out of being
a stranger.

### Thursday, March 7th, 2024
"Three notebooks, three different gifts.
The one she didn't buy, the one I bought but didn't give,
and the one she bought and gave.
They can't be the same."

"It's been a long time no see", told me Dr Franck in our meeting this morning.
He mentioned we hadn't met for a whole year.

I told him about the issues with the medication.
The increased side effects and my annoyance with having to eat food just before bed.
I forgot to mention how I have gained weight.
I made no mention either to my obsessive traits.

He renewed my prescription, but with a change in the dosage.
Instead of taking a 40mg pill at night before bed,
I'll take a 20mg one in the morning and a second 20mg in the afternoon.
He also prescribed me a sleeping pill so I can stop waking up at 3h or 4h,
as it has been happening more and more lately.

The meeting was short but not as short as others.
We scheduled a follow-up for April, to see how things will have gone.

I kept working on the PreventAD data and on my journals.

Writing about those days almost ten years ago is hard.
I passed the first day I took the antidepressants.
It is weird reading my deadname.
I have been deleting it in a couple of days.

Alda is back in Montréal.
I asked her if she was interested in starting reading the journal.
Before she could answer I sent her a snippet of a single day back in August of 2015.
In it, I talk about Monica calling me around Christmas to describe a journal she didn't buy.
Next year, I found that notebook and bought it for her.
I gave it to her after she returned from France and before we stopped talking.
That day of August I found she had given an exact same notebook—possibly the same one—to a friend of hers.

I sent it to Sonny as well.
I don't think either of them has read it.

I should be comfortable with the idea that nobody cares about reading my pages.

Sonny just texted me.

"Ya llegué a casa.
Te manda saludos Luis; dice que ya te cases conmigo.
Le estaba diciendo a sus amigos que eres súper guapa."

I met Luis, Sonny's friend, in Mexico City when we were dating.
I remember the three of us going to the terrace of a bar in Zona Rosa.

When I read Sonny's message,
I thought she was the one who talked about me to his friends.
That's not what the text says.

Why is it so hard to imagine him sincerely finding me attractive?

I think about all these girls who have rejected me.
I think about my fear that, after our date tomorrow,
I will get the same familiar text from Sophie.

No, my rejection anxiety has moved on from her saying that she doesn't feel a
romantic connection with me, to her reacting badly to me disclosing I'm trans.

I should know better by now, that disclosing it early enough is better for me.
I feel much more at ease when they seem to not care about it.

In the many scenarios that I play in my head,
I see her getting nervous and our date being clouded by an awkward ambience
before she decides to leave early.
I imagine her assertively telling me how,
because of the history with her ex,
she doesn't think she can be with someone like us.
I think about the date going totally normal just for her to never appear again
in my life.

This is stupid.
I should not preoccupy myself with stuff that hasn't happen.
If she rejects me because of being trans,
then she would have done so since the very beginning.

I seem to get more hurt by the lose of what could happen than of what actually did.

I haven't texted her since her confirming the plans two days ago.
I thought about deleting the conversation,
leaving it blank and ready to be filled again.

I didn't, I can't let go of it just yet.

_I was missing your little hearts._

Tomorrow I have to text her to confirm the time.
In my head, I imagine myself waiting for her at a table inside the bar.
Her office is on my way downtown from the MNI.
I considered proposing her to meet her there and walk together.

It might be too much.
I will probably go with my original plan.

### Friday, March 8th, 2024
"Before you put your mask on: Can I kiss you?"

I started texting Sonny when I transferred to the orange line.
I was getting off at Jarry when I sent her:

"No se ponerlo en palabras.

"I know I'm gonna get really hurt.

"But not yet."

Last night I took the 20mg pill of Lurasidone and the 5 mg of Dayvigo—the sleeping pill.
I feel a different kind of fatigue.
It was not the usual drive to get to bed as soon as possible as with the
old dose of antipsychotics.
I was tired, but also not like the usual tiredness I am familiar with.
It was not uncomfortable, just new.

I might have stayed 15 or 20 minutes on my phone before turning and letting myself fall asleep.

Just like other days, I woke up at 4h.

This time I didn't get back to sleep in the early morning.
At around 6h30, I stood up and started my day.
I showered and got dressed.
I had picked the outfit the day before.
I even wore make-up.

When I put the foundation on the brush,
pushing the top spat out some of the last drops of the bottle into the wall
and the left sleeve of my white shirt.
I managed to grab some of the remainings of what was left into the brush and
then brushed that on my face.

I put eyeliner and mascara.

I went to the lab and was, obviously, the first person there.
I even walked from Sherbrooke to the MNI through the stadium.

I might have gotten to the office before 8h, but I am not totally sure.

The morning was slow and uneventful.
I had my croissant with my coffee;
I even took the morning lurasidone pill despite my anxiety of ruining the whole day.

Neda arrived not much later.

István—I found his card in my drawer—passed to say hi.

Around lunch I texted Sophie to ask her for the time she would get off work.
She replied fairly quickly despite the familiar notice that her notifications had been disabled.
She finishes at 17h, but she'd have to go back home to feed her cats.
We settled on meeting at 19h.

My scripts were running and I got tired of reading on the screen,
so I decided to leave them working and come back home.

I walked again the whole way to the metro.
Before arriving to my building,
I made a stop at the dépanneur next to it and bought a small bag of chips.
I had them with the rest of hummus while watching the first half of a movie I did not finish.
Amy Adams was in it, playing an agoraphobic child psychologist.
Even now that I am writing these words,
I prefer to leave the television shut off than to continue watching it.

I went to bed but did not sleep.
Around 18h, Sophie texted again apologizing and asking if we could meet 30 minutes later,
as she had to do some improptu over-time.
I sincerely didn't mind.

I left with enough time to arrive early on porpuse.
I wanted to calmly sit down and wait by myself to calm my nerves.
I got there 5 minutes before our agreed time.

I walked inside and found the bar fuller than what I would have expected.

I went to the back room, where I had met the NB post-doc who worked at McGill.
There was an empty table in the corner that was perfect.
I went to sit down and one of the waitress approached me to ask if I had a reservation.
I answered her and redundantly asked her if the table was reserved.

She asked me if I was expecting somebody and moved me to a table at the front.
It was right next to the table where I sat in front of the couple with whom
I would have my first dose of shrooms and who would reject me after all
three of us slept on the same bed.

Sophie texted me that she was on her way.
The waitress asked me if I wanted a moment.
I assumed she was giving me the opportunity of waiting for my companion.
I ordered a Kentucky Mule.
It was a good thing that I did, both for my anxiety and because I still
waited another 30 minutes before Sophie's arrival.

She took off her layers and sat down in front of me.
Her glasses make her eyes look bigger.

She talked to me about her issues at work.
She has been given a formal complaint from a coworker accusing her of harrassment.
Someone who had actually had harrassed her himself.
We talked about her childhood as an actor and growing up repressed by the teachings of the mormon church.

We talked about lesbian books and I asked her about her favourite lesbian movie.
She hasn't seen many since she has only recently come out as a lesbian since 2020.
I mentioned _Portrait de la jeune fille en feu_ as my favourite one and
threw the idea of watching it together on the table.
She accepted it without thinking.

We talked about dating, our approaches to it and how it has been affected by our mental conditions;
having adhd for her, and being bipolar in my case.
I told her the story of the couple and my diagnosis.
When we talked about attachment styles, I even told her how my last crush had gone.

We laughed, both of us; sincerely and enthusiastically.

I mentioned to her how we had talked about she telling me the stories of her
dating after I went away to Mexico.
She narrated me her disastrous hook-up date with a Star Wars fan.

When she so casually talked about going to a girl's house on the first date,
I felt a mixture of envy and excitement.
I could tell her to come with me to my house.

I remembered I hadn't really told her that I am trans.
Instead of telling her then to get it out of the way,
I discarded my original idea.

"Enough of talking about the negative, tell me some good stories", I said.

"Well, I actually had a really good time with you..."

"Thank you", I don't know why I cut her off before lying,
"but that's not the answer I was going for."

She told me one where they ran into their coworkers.
Both hers and her date partner's.

Even writing this, I keep thinking of reasons not to accept the idea that I was the best date she's had.
It must be to not hurt my feelings.
You don't talk about someone who you really like with the date you're one.

When we were talking about getting better in our insecure attachment styles,
she mentioned that she would be direct with me.

I took the pills a couple of paragraphs above and it is already hard to
concentrate in writing this or even remembering the words that were said.

She told me that she wanted to be open with me,
and mentioned that the next two weeks are going to be hard.
She said she'd try to reach out,
but she was very careful not to make any promises.

I saw her face change and catch her rubbing her legs.
I asked her if she was in pain, and she didn't hide it.

"Look, I don't want you to go, but I can ask for the bill if you want."

We did that.
The waitress brought me one and then told her the price of her irish whisky.
I told her that it was going to be just one.
She did the math in her head and passed me the terminal.

We walked towards Guy-Concorday station and she made a comment about studying there.
We briefly talked about our old apartments before getting to the front of the entrance.

Like my last crush two years ago,
she warned me that she was going to put her mask on,
and made a comment how she still wears masks in the metro.

I got over my fear and asked her to kiss her.

"Sure", she said with a smile.

I approached her and put my arm on her waist.
The kiss was short and it felt hurried.
We pulled away and I felt awkward.
I tell myself that it was because she was in pain.
I hope she didn't think it was awful.

We waited for the metro.
We talked about naps and being tired.
She made a comment about feeling a haze due to the pain.
She seemed like it.

When we were approaching my station,
I told her I had had a really good time and that I hoped her pain flare were
mild and quick.
I put my hand over her thigh and I think I saw her intention of putting her
hand over mine, but the action, like our kiss, felt disorganized and clumsy.

She wished me to arrive home safe.

None of us have texted.

### Sunday, March 10th, 2024
"As someone who's literally on a date with you right now: Please don't."

"[...] I will try to reach out more often."

It was a hard weekend.

I can hear the sound of the bubbling of the boiling pasta water behind me.
I got out of bed again to start preparing the tuna salad.
I won't eat right now, but I want to put in the fridge for a couple of hours before I have dinner.
I need to have some food with my second pills.

I didn't write yesterday.
I could have, but I think I decided not to do it.
By the time I came home, my head was all foggy from the second dosage of antipsychotics.
I went straight to bed.

Yesterday—Saturday's morning—I slept through the whole night.
I got out of bed around 9h without any difficulty and started my day with coffee,
a bagel and the new dosage of medication.

I can't remember what I did most of the day.
I think I tried to play a little—I put on Hollow Knight,
but couldn't be entertained for more than 15 minutes.
I downloaded the books that Sophie recommended, but haven't started any of them.

I thought about her in the morning.
After our first date back in December,
she texted me after her concert ended to tell me she had had a lovely night
and to wish me safe travels.
The second date, she misunderstood my text me when you're back request
texting me 30 minutes after the date to let me know she was back in her office
and her meeting was over.
I thought about our talk about behaving anxiously and avoidantly in our relationships.
I felt guilty about her guilt-driven offer of reaching out more often after I
acknowledge that her style of texting had left me wondering if she was really
interested in me.
Still, I decided to text her.

"I had a lovely night yesterday",
I punctuated with a red heart like she would send a couple of weeks ago,
"it was even more fun than the first one!"

I thought about the end of the night.
How I noticed the flashing gestures of pain in her face and the switching of postures;
the subtle rubbing of her legs.
I continued my message.

"BTW, thank you for staying so long pushing through your pain,
you really didn't have to."

I didn't honestly expect her to reply soon.
She said her pain flare was coming up.
When she cancelled me that Saturday because of her pain,
she didn't reach back until I asked her how she was doing a couple of days later.

The text was still unread a couple of moments ago before I
sent it away from sight into the deleted messages.

I saw in my apple watch the calendar event of the social gathering that was
supposed to happen today for the executive board of the MJM.

I didn't want to go.
It was supposed to be at Thomson House in the evening.
When I opened the conversation,
I saw a thread of messages from a week ago when someone realized that
Thomson House is closed on the weekends.
They suggested several places and settled for Bar Ganadara, or Bar Gana.

I looked for it online, but couldn't find it.
I knew they were talking about Ganadara,
but wasn't sure if it was the one we had recently gone to celebrate the lab's
birthdays—including mine.
I posted a message asking for someone to share the address.

Another girl—Meryem, I think?—even thanked me for raising the question,
since by now it had completely slipped her mind.

The reservation was at 19h.
Like I just wrote, I don't remember what I did most of the day until then.

It was raining when I stepped off the building and waited for the 30 bus.
I rode it just until station Rosemont.
I was listening to my iPod the whole way.

There was a girl sitting on the metro wearing white.
I looked at her and she noticed me.
I felt embarrased and turned away.
There was something about her that felt magnetic.
I would catch glimpses of her dancing to the music coming from her airpods as
she was browsing her phone.

I eventually got off and walked to the place.
I can't remember how I was feeling.

I got inside and the hostess attended the group of asian guys who were in front of me.
They told her something and then sat on a little bench when she went back.
I stood in front of the small podium waiting for her to come back.
The reservation was under the name Susan, for 7 people.

Another girl came behind me and passed directly to a table in the back.
I hadn't met any of these people in person in the two years I've worked with them.

I remember I had gone on a date with Valerie to McKibbin's pub and told her
how I was applying for a job in a journal.
Back then I thought the position would be payed.

I can't remember how many dates I went out with Valerie before she told me that
she felt we were better fitted as friends.
Have I passed that number with Sophie?

Is that what I fear, then, that I will get now a similar response from her as well?

The hostess came back and I told her the phrase I had rehearsed in my head.
She pointed at the table that was right in the back, the one which that girl had just gone to.

When I got there we were only women.
It would be a couple of minutes before Bennett arrived.
And another while before Viet, the last person, would finally complete the table.

Most of the people in the table were medical students.
One of them, the girl who was sitting right next to me was a resident—I forgot which specialty.
The girl to her left was doing her master's,
and the one in front me, was finishing her PhD in nutrition.

All of them were also younger than me.
The other grad student was also born in 1993,
but her birthday hasn't happened yet.

I felt left out of most conversations at first.
It didn't last the whole night, but it was enough to remind me of how I've
gotten used to feel like an outsider.

At first they had told us that because we were more than 6 people we could
either have just one bill for the whole table,
or distribute equally the full amount of the bill among the whole party.
We settled on someone paying and then we transferring them the money.

I was not too hungry and I had just ordered the Alto poutine the night before,
so I had a plate of Takoyaki and shared a pitcher of beer with the table.
We waited for all of us to had their plates before we started eating.

I had eaten around two balls before I subtly took my pills out of my keyring
and put them in my mind.
I didn't have to hide the fact that I was taking medications.
I still wanted to.

I started feeling the side effects of the medication mid-night.
It was around 21h and I wanted to get out of there.
The small talk in the metro felt excruciating.
I wanted nothing more than get home and go straight to bed.

During the night the had asked me where do I live.
I replied Villeray, but Viet did not understand me.
I mentioned Jean-Talon and the francophone girl—Ainhoa?—intended to interrupt
his thoughts with an explanation.
He got it by himself and pronouned it outloud in a completely different way.
I guess I have no idea how to pronounce my own neighborhood.

Even though I was ready to hide in my bed, I took the sleeping pill.

It didn't work.
I woke up from a dream at 3h.
It didn't take me long to fall asleep again, but I woke up a second time.
The whole morning I felt unrested.
I didn't get up until after noon.

Now that I wrote that,
I realize that the time on my microwave is different to the one in my electronics.
Apparently, this morning the DST began at 2h, around the same time that I woke up.

I had some of the tuna salad and the second dosage of antipsychotics.
I haven't felt the side effects this time.

I was supposed to go out with Alda this evening.
We were going to go to _La Toxica_ for tacos and then get a beer.
She cancelled last minute because she was feeling under the weather.
I was still in bed wearing my pajamas.
We are meeting Tuesday at _La graine Brûlée_.

Aliza sent me a text asking if I want to go to Thomson House this Thursday.

Tomorrow the evaluations for French class start.

I think I have still another week of French after that.

### Monday, March 11th, 2024
"He made us lose 30 minutes going through
_Qu'est-ce que vous avez fait cette fin de semaine-là ?_

"I finished the evaluation in 15 minutes and now the asshole wants us to stay
so that the losers can practice their stupid _production orale_.
I fucking hate this class."

I think I am in a bad mood.
Maybe taking the second dosage of the medication before the French class was not the best idea.
I don't feel the anguish nor the fogginess that I felt last Saturday,
even though I also drank this afternoon.
It's just irritability.

I woke up again at 3h.
I took a screenshot with the idea of sending it to Aliza or Sonny as a form of complaint.

What did I intend with that gesture?
Do I want them to see the futility of my reaching out to the psychiatrist?
Do I want them to notice how hard it is for me despite that I am actually trying?

I put off the alarm, yet I was the first person to arrive at the office.

I didn't take the long way there, but rather the 24 bus.
I got in by the stairs of the gymnaseum.

I sent a message to Sonny's therapist.
This time I didn't consult with ChatGPT about the grammar.
I thought it would take her longer to reply back.
Before I left the lab after the Neuro meeting,
we had already agreed to meet this Thursday for the initial consultation by Zoom.

I'll see her in two days at 13h.
I guess I will stay home and meet with Louis on Teams.

I checked online and they have charged me for the new foundation—I think that was yesterday.

This morning, I saw online about the premiere of _Love Lies Bleeding_.
After a quick google search, I learned that it's coming out this week.
Not much later I was buying the ticket to myself this Thursday evening.
It will be good to take my mind off everything.

I was filling out my calendar while the rest of the French class were finishing with their evaluation.
I forgot to put in my meeting with Aliza this Thursday at Thomson House after her class.

I went today to Thomson House.
I met Alda.
We hadn't seen each other in a while.
She was back from Europe last week—I think the 8th.

We were going to meet yesterday, but the plans fizzled out.
We had talked about going out tomorrow to work on a café,
since I need to leave my building after they fumigate it.
Still, after the Neuro meeting, I texted her if she wanted to go grab a drink at Thomson's before our respective French classes.

She had her wisdom teeth removed.
We talked a bit about that.
I need to figure out what I am going to do this summer and when exactly.
Last I spoke with my mum, she offered to pay me for the therapy sessions.
I told her to help me with the wisdom teeth instead.

At the lab, we talked a little bit about the visas for Korea.
OHBM sent Vlad a promotional e-mail about the conference.
Neda needs a different kind of visa to go there.
Vlad made a comment about the X gender marker in the passport and how it is not recognized in Korea.
Did they notice how I suddenly got uncomfortable when we got to that subject?

Louis original suggestion for AAIC in Philadelphia was to rent a van and drive together.
That would be impossible for me.
Maybe it was just a crazy idea and we'll all fly there.
Maybe we don't even go at all.

If we do go, I can ask to redirect my flight to San Diego and stay with my family for the rest of the summer.
Just now am I thinking about French class.
Hopefully the next session will still online—as much as I hate it.
I don't want to have to go all the way to La Salle.

The class has returned.
Last Wednesday my teams was not working.
The camera would not work at all.
We were just going to move on to practice a made-up conversation.
I decided to sent a text to the professor telling him that I was going to disconnect.
He didn't see it at all, thus I sent him an e-mail.
I never got a response.

Now they're practicing it.
I don't want to do it.
I don't feel like turning on the camera.
I'll stay hidden behind the profile picture unless I am called out.

When Alda and I started gathering our stuff,
I saw a girl walk besides the building towards the playing field.
She was wearing a leather jacket but the hair colour was off.
I still hurried towards the exit but I didn't see her well.
All the way to the metro until I took the train was I half-expecting to catch a glimpse of her.

When I got home, I deleted the still-unread message from Saturday before discarding the recently-deleted messages for good.

### Tuesday, March 12th, 2024
_She'd only love two things.
The first was her long dark hair.
The second was how easily she could cut it off and feel nothing._

I got up early because I wanted to shower before the fumigators would arrive.
I don't remember if I changed the alarm.
I might have postponed it a little bit until 8h30.

I did not have breakfast nor brewed any coffee.

Last night I emptied out the cupboards and left everything ready for the technician's arrival.

I kept waiting on my phone.
I remembered how the last time they started around 10h or 11h.
Before 10h, though, I started feeling impatient.

Alda texted me in the morning if they had arrived yet.

They didn't knock on my door until after 11h.
Through the peephole, I saw the same woman as the last time a couple of months ago.

She had a key that she put on the doors from which she didn't get a response.
I could had left in the morning.

I bought a small pastry from Cocobun.
The woman in front of me selected No Tip from the terminal.
Even though I payed in cash, I gave her the small change to the korean woman in the cashier.
I had my morning pills before exiting the station.

I arrived at _La graine brûlée_ a bit past noon.
Alda replied to my I'm here text saying she hadn't left yet.
She joined me around 13h.

All day I kept supervising the scripts and continuing working with the journal from 2015.
I started feeling a bit depressed from those days.
I switched back the word deadname to my actual deadname.

I was still in September from that year,
before I couldn't do it anymore and ask Alda if she wanted to leave early.

I saw her glance towards Dollarama.
I asked her if she wanted to go, but she mistook my clarification for an invitation.
In there, I bougth a small bag of chips.

I got home at around 16h.
I started putting the stuff back in their place without taking off my headphones.

Alda had mentioned that she liked reading the day I had shared with her.
I had sent her one day back in 2015,
when I suspected that Monica had given Mallinali the same journal that I
bought for her before her departure to France.
After I cleaned it a little bit, I sent her the entry from November 14th of 2021.
One night after meeting Kate, where I talk about our previous night in the club.

Alda really liked it.
Which made me want to share more with her.
I offered her one two years later, from June 2023, on which I talk about a
week before and my night with Alexia.
I sent her while people were gathering in Teams for the second day of evaluations.

Alda, after that one, told me how she really liked my writing and she wished
she had read more about the night itself.

We finished the oral comprehension part before the pause at 19h30.
I found it annoying.
I don't think I had a perfect score, but I did the best that I could have.

The second part of the class was preparing another oral production practice.
My Teams started malfunctioning when he broke us up in rooms.
I was tempted not to reconnect again, but two times in a row would look too suspicious.

At the café, I realized that I have the perfect excuse to miss out on the social
gathering next week with the CCNA conference that I registered for.

I was paired up with Senio, thus, it was not as bad as it could have been.
In the end we did not go up.

When the class ended, I went to the fridge to have the rest of the tuna salad.
I had the second portion of the medication.
At first I did not feel any side effects,
other than walk around my apartment fantasizing out-loud on what I
could text to Sophie in the next two weeks.

Right now, I feel much more calmer in that sense after realizing it's an awful idea.
On the other hand, I find it extremely hard to complete these words.
I need to note down for our next appointment how going with Dr Franck's
original idea of taking the second dosage at lunch time is almost as crazy as
textking Sophie out of the blue inviting her to come over one of these nights
to play Trauma Bonding the drinking game, as she called it, over a bottle of wine.

### Wednesday, March 13th, 2024
"Hi there, how are you? Sorry for late reply [...]"

Today I got a text I had already started thinking I would never receive.

I kept waking up and falling back asleep since around 4h.
My alarm was set earlier than the usual 7h45.

I don't remember if dreamed anything.
I have the vague feeling of hopping out of an unfamiliar reality, but I can't remember anything in particular.

I did the usual morning routine I am getting tired of describing everyday.
I put on the wine-coloured pants.
I weighted 78.25 kg.
It's not the lowest I've been these past few days, but it's not much higher either.
I might end up winning the bet.

I passed by _la boulangerie_, I ordered the same thing I always do.
_Je prends un croissant amandes, stp._
Sometimes they mistake the almonds part for normal.

I grabbed the metro and the 24 bus.
I had enough time to take the walk through _des Pins_,
but didn't really feel like it.

I got to the office a couple of minutes after 8h.
I had the entire corridor to myself.
I ate my pastry and drank my coffee in silence.

The meeting with Pedro and his team was scheduled at 9h.
The first one to arrive was Vlad.
Then Daniel.
Lastly, with a handful of minutes to spare, arrived Neda.
We marched together to Louis office.

The meeting went as usual.
Pedro praised all research projects but mine.
I purposefully said nothing more than the mere necessary.
Louis excused me by saying I've been busy preparing the PreventAD data.
Before we left the office,
Daniel and Neda made some comments about the code running in my terminal.
I was just finishing extracting the Hippocampal and Ventricular volumes from
the recently segmented images.
Lines were flashing down the screen.
_It looks more impressive than it actually is._
I've grown accustomed to saying something like that.

When the meeting was over,
I asked Neda for her Racket disease staging measures and Reza for his Brain Age Gap measures.
The former sent them to me immediately.
The latter later replied to my Teams message asking me if there was a hurry.

"Not at all! Preferably before either of us graduates."

I've gotten used to letting my phone automatically set up the working do not
disturbe mode that activates because of the location.
I doubt anyone gives any attention to it like I used to do for someone.

In one of my many trips to the restroom,
I unlocked my phone and saw a new name next to Maykol's.
A recently forgotten name.
Unexpected.

The emoji was not a cat, but an abbacus.

Two years ago I went on a date with a girl who had a picture boarding an ikea
shopping cart mid laugh.
Was it really a date or did we clarified it's platonic nature since the very
beginning?
She told me she would be deleting Hinge but wanted to remain in contact since
she was in a desperate need of friends.

We went to Palco, in Verdun,
the same bar that I escaped from last month in my latest attempt of a lesbian party.

I didn't open her weeks-old response until a couple of moments ago.
I haven't replied.
I don't know what I'll tell her.
I know I sent her the text because I wanted to rant about my latest obsessive gestures.
Her last message ends with _How have you been?_

How have I been?

I'll need to answer that same question tomorrow afternoon with Fabiola.
I think it was me who gave Sonny her contact.
I took her to that practice in Coyoacán that one time, years ago.

I left the office after the CIC Lecture ended.
It was a talk about the effect of affirmative gender care in infance and youth in western and eastern cultures.
When I briefly talked with Aliza about it, I told her it was ok.
_Just OK_.
I wouldn't bother going back to revisit the recording.

Tomorrow I will meet with her at Thomson after my meeting with Louis.

Instead of walking towards Station Sherbrooke,
I took the 80 bus at _du Parc_ until Fairmount.
I was tempted to enter the homonymous bagel shop,
but I just got myself an order of _gnocchi_.
I finished them before I got to Station Laurier.

I waited inside the train for around 10 minutes before it started moving.

Today it was the last day of French class for the week.
We didn't finish with the evaluations.

Before class I felt so exhausted, I decided to take a 1-hour nap before 18h.
I fell asleep enumerating to myself the reasons why I do and don't expect
Sophie to reach out ever again.

### Thursday, March 14th, 2024
"_¿Sabes cómo con TDAH, los estimulantes tienen un efecto paradógico?
Yo tengo una naturaleza represiva y el alcohol es inhibitorio._"

I am sitting on a table at the corner in Thomson's House.

Aliza was sitting on this chair just a couple of minutes ago.
I am looking straight at the blonde girl who Aliza mentioned looks like someone
whom she was—kind of—attracted to in college.
Her eyeglasses are red.
Her hands are large.
She's playing with the edge of the table while she talks to the guy to her left.

People at her table are coming back with two pitchers of beers.

While Aliza was her—I was sitting at the other end of the table—I looked at a different woman.
She has not come back.
She is dark-haired and is wearing a red t-shirt.
She's the only one who hasn't come back.

Why am I describing strangers?

Is this how it should feel when I photograph people on the streets?

I had therapy this afternoon.

I told Aliza how next Monday I have an appointment with Calli.
I need to break up with her.
I can't repeat what happened two years ago with the two therapists.
I am sure she will understand.

Why do I still feel bad about it?

A couple of years in the future,
when I come back to read these words and remember back to this day,
will I picture the two women from that large table next to us that I referred to?

The red-t-shirted girl came back,
but she's sitting in an angle in which I can't glance at her.
The blonde girl is right in front of me but hasn't looked in my way this whole time.

My session with Fabiola went alright.
I did feel at ease and I have the feeling that it will be useful for me.
We just got to know of each other.
I talked about my life here in Canada, the program and my time left,
my hobbies and my family dynamic.

I mentioned—in passing—that I was trans.
Did she know of it beforehand?
There was no nod of understanding, nor a repressed surprise reaction.
She did ask folow-up questions about it.

I've transitioned for almost 8 years now.
I've been a woman for almost a third of my life.

The session end with half an hour of time before my meeting with Louis.
I sent him a text on Teams a minute before our alloted time.
After 5 minutes, I sent him an e-mail in case he hadn't seen it.

I waited for 20 minutes without a response.

I texted Reza asking him if he had met with Louis.
He replied fairly quickly to say he did, they met in person at his office.
I joked that then it was personal.

"_Me le quedo viendo a la chica que se parece a tu chica.
Se me viene a la cabeza cuando mi ex me dijo aquí en Montréal_
Staring is rude, you know?" I just texted Aliza on Whatsapp.

Louis came online on Teams.
He replied to my e-mail explaining that he had just missed my earlier e-mail,
he then went to the office looking for me and had no internet, thus no messages.
He was soon meeting with MohammedReza, but maybe we could try at 15h30.

I replied to his e-mail almost immediately, agreeing to his proposed time.

Aliza replied to my earlier text telling me that she was just coming out from her exam.
I told her I'd be meeting her around 16h30 and, just moments later,
Louis sent a text throught Teams that his meeting with MohammedReza had just
come to an premature ending.

"_Quiero mandarle mensaje a la chica que se llama casi como yo,
pero mejor le voy a mandar mensaje a la chica que se llama casi como mi—otra—ex._"
I texted Aliza further down in our conversation.

With Louis, I talked about the Qrater paper submission;
the status of the HVR paper; what ideas I had come out regarding the TRIAD project.
When our meeting ended, I grabbed my laptop, my backpack and came here.

Aliza was already sitting here—at the exact same seat I am right now—when I came through the door.

I have another hour to kill before I should start getting on my way to the theater.
Alda also bought tickets to the movies.
Maybe I should text her about meeting beforehand.

I've drunk almost two pints of cider and I'm starting to feel them.

"_Sí le mandé mensaje, no me importa si contesta o no.
Quisiera sentirme asi con_ named-almost-like-me."

### Saturday, March 16th, 2024
"Alda, Vero just asked me now how my dating life is going.
I don't know how to answer her.
How is it going?"

I need to do laundry this weekend.
I can't keep postponing it over and over.
The clothes are now overflowing the hampers

I probably won't go today.

There is always Sunday.

Yesterday I was supposed to meet Alda at a café somewhere to do some work.
We talked about checking out _La poubelle magnifique_,
this new underground kind of thing that is around Crescent.
_Aunja_, the iranian café on Sherbrooke was another viable option.

I broke my rule about having coffee after noon.

I told Alda later when we met that I had not done a single productive thing.
That was lie.
I sent out a reply to Jennifer's e-mail inquiring about the status of the
PreventAD data processing.

That was how much I worked on the last day of the week.

The night before, Thursday, I did get home pretty late.

I got quite drunk as well.

Aliza left and I sat on her chair.
I had still half a pint of cider left.
When Alda texted that she was inside Thomson's,
I chugged the rest and we left on our way.

We made a stop at metro.
Alda got herself a can of beer.
I wandered around considering getting something for me,
but nothing was appetizing enough.
She offered sneaking it in for me if that was what was stopping me.
I don't think it was.

We walked the couple of steps to the movies.
The lady at the entrance who scanned our tickets explained something to us,
but most of it got missed in the French.
Another women beside her teared off two small tickets and gave us one each.

I walked towards the concession stand.
Alda said she would wait around.
I bought myself a small bag of popcorn.

With my buttery food, I went towards the standing tables.
Alda was not in there.
I thought she was in the restrooms, so I stayed for a bit.
Had I glanced at my phone I would had seen her texts telling me she had gone inside the theater.

She was sitting on the last row.
The vast majority of the people inside were queer women.

How did I know they were queer?
What was it that gave me the idea these women are like me?

Before the movie started,
two cinema workers came inside with a handful of red gym bags,
merchandise of the movie.
The tickets that they had given us were for a small raffle.
One of the winners was the number right before Alda's.

The movie was as queer as it could have been.
Alda liked it more than I did.
I got annoyed by the characters' impulsive decisions.
The protagonists' relationship felt foreign to me.

"I won't settle for anything less",
commented Alda about their relationship when the movie ended and we were
leaving the theater.

She went South towards _des Pins_ and I walked up north to catch the 30 bus
passing in front of station Sherbrooke.
I made it in time.
The bus left me across the street from my building at around midnight.

Friday, I cancelled the plans of going to a café.
We would meet Veronica at Le warehouse in the evening after work.
The plans were taking form.
We would meet at _Le furniture warehouse_, the one in St-Laurent,
rather than the one in Crescent.
We would meet at 19h.

I mistakenly thought that yesterday was Saint Patrick's,
so the idea came up of making a reservation.
I didn't take the initiative of doing it since I hate making phone calls.
Alda texted me on the side to tell me she was feeling anxious about doing it.
I remembered how there are sometimes links to websites in Google maps where
you can make the reservations online.
I looked into it and found the website of the different locations for the bar in Montréal.
On the Contact webpage, there was a small notice saying that none of their establishments take reservations.

The afternoon passed uneventfully.

It was the first time since Cuba that I wore the dark denim jacket.
I even put on make-up.
The new foundation tone fits me better, but it still felt fake.
I put on some eye-liner.
I looked fine; not great nor bad, just fine.

I walked from station Sherbrooke towards St-Laurent.
I was walking on Prince Arthur when Vero texted us asking if we were on our way.
Someone had mentioned that we should aim to arrive on time so the bar wouldn't be too crowded.
I stopped in front of the bar 3 minutes before our agreed time.
Alda was also on her way.
It wasn't long before I saw her standing across the street waiting for the lights to change.

We decided to go inside and wait for Vero at a table.
The place seemed pretty empty.
The hostess received us and guided us to a booth.
She left two menus for us.
We were sitting right under a speaker.
The place was pretty empty and the music too loud.
The prices were not as cheap as we were expecting.
We didn't last more than 5 minutes before we grabbed our stuff and left.

The day before that I walked around the area, I noticed the irish flag of a pub around the corner from where we were.
I proposed going there instead a propos of it being Saint Patrick's.

This time I replied to the hostess who let us in.
I asked her in French if they had a table available for three people.
She suggested the bar and then asked us to wait for a bit.
They did have a space in the back in one of those higher tables.
She left us there with three menus on the table.

Alda and I ordered a pint of Guiness while we waited for Vero to arrive.
She apologized for the tardiness and assured us she was on her way and would arrive in around 10 minutes.

"We'll be there in 10 mins; sorry I'm late guys!"

Alda and I wondered about the possibility of Vero coming with someone given her pronoun use.
It was not 10 minutes until she came but she did arrive alone.
She was videocalling her man when she sat on the empty stall.

I put on How I met your mother replacing New Girl as the stuff playing on the background.

We were sitting inside N.
Sophie had already ordered her irish whisky.
I had just asked her to move on from the negative and suggested she told me about the highlights of her dating stories.
After acknowledging she had indeed passed a very nice time on our first date,
she was telling me about that time she was on a date with someone when they run into groups of both of their coworkers.

Was that the story that triggered her friend suggesting that she was the
female version of Ted Mosby in the lesbian retelling of How I met your mother?

If there were a lesbian retelling of How I met your mother,
I would be Ted Mosby getting fixated on the idea of a person.

Vero ordered a Jaggerbomb and Alda and I got ourselves a plate of fries.
It was after this first meal that we started drinking Irish whiskey by
ordering a round of ginger & lime Jameson cocktails.

"Remember you have to mantain eye contact when making a toast!" Said Vero.
"Otherwise you get seven years of bad sex."

"I think I prefer bad sex over no sex."

We paid our bills and decided to move bars.
We went to check out the other Warehouse location in Crescent.
We could always check out a different place around the area if we decided
it wasn't to our liking.

We waited around 10 minutes in line.
When it was our turn to get in, the bouncers asked us for our IDs.
Vero was not carrying a wallet.
At first the guy told her it had to be a physical ID.
He then asked her her age.
When she said 25, he took her phone.
He looked at the picture and asked her for the address.
I stayed next to her, but I am not sure why.

At our booth we started getting the night special of PBR and a shot of Jameson.

In the first warehouse the music was loud.
In _Ye olde orchard_, the loudness came from the surrounding conversations.
In this later bar, there were both of those things.
At least, in this warehouse, I was enjoying the music.

Alda and I split Vero's beer, and we kept ordering rounds of shots of Jameson.
The last time, the waitress brought us doubles since we had to wait for them.

We left in time to catch the metro.
Vero walked with me to the Station, but we went in oppositde directions.
Both Alda and I woke up today with a hangover.

I ordered pizza tonight.
It should be on its way.

### Sunday, March 17th, 2024
"I'm still in mtl, didn't move anywhere. I'm ok."

Today I stayed in bed.

After turning off the alarm at 9h, my watch kept vibrating several times.

The first time it was with the picture of a vintage car in Cuba.
The second time, it showed me my father's portrait—probably taken by my mom.
The third time it didn't contain any pictures, as Messages don't.
I wanted a cat but got an abbacus instead.

When the morning finally ended, I got out of bed and actually went to shower.
I am wearing the green cargo pants with the poutine t-shirt I bought at a
souvenirs' shop.
Just now am I realizing that I bought this shirt with Monica.

Should I text her? That would definitely keep my head busy from the—lack
of—texts of other people.

I tried not to open the message I did recieve. I read it from the preview and
it seemed curt and dry.
It felt nice not caring about it.
I deleted the conversation without opening, knowing that I'd have 30 days to
revive it.

I grabbed my tote bag and walked towards Tsikinis.
I bought a dozen eggs, a tomato, a couple of onions, and a bag of tortillas.
I walked back home and prepared breakfast with some of the new ingredients and
the leftovers fries from last night.

This morning I weighted the more than 79kg.
That didn't prevented me from cooking three rather than two eggs.
This evening I really wanted to get out a third time to the dépanneur and get
me some beers; maybe walking a bit further to SAQ and buying myself a bottle
of Vodka.
At least I could contain myself from doing that.

The SAQ closed half an hour ago.

After eating I went inside my room and put most of my dirty clothes into my
weekend bag.
The pants and sheets went into a large tote bag.

The walk to the laundromat was serene and uneventful.
It felt briefer than usual.

I kept reading Honey girl while the washing machines ran.
The astronomer listened to the radio show of her recent bride.
The book is starting with the romance.
Am I enjoying it?

It makes me thinkg of what I don't have.

After the two washing machines that I always use finished,
I moved the sheets to one of the dryers that I always use.
I was ready to start putting the clothes on the drier above,
but I saw a green piece of tape hanging on the handle of the door.
I didn't want to risk it, so I placed my clothes on the one to the left.

I think that machine might be cheaper than the other ones.
For two dollars it kept running much more than the other one that had the sheets.
I stopped it even before it could finish.
The clothes were burning hot.

I took the baskets to the table where I was reading,
first Honey Girl and then the journal for 2024 that I exported last night.
I fold the clothes and started feeling nervous that some of them have shrunk.
Maybe the jeans will be tighter.
Perhaps the t-shirts that I got with my family this winter will be shorter.

I think I lost a sock.

Last night, I am not entirely sure why, I exported the missing days from my journal.
I put them into the Markdown document and made a PDF with all of 2024.
It starts in the end of January, after Sophie cancelled our second date.
It finishes with yesterday's 1500 words fixing the broken streak.

I read some of it before going to bed, and I read it further before falling
asleep.
I made it to around page 46 of 75, before I fell under the effects of my
sleeping pill.

The water for the pasta that I will have for dinner is bubbling,
but it's not really boiling yet.
The oven is pre-heated waiting for my leftover pizza.

One of the morning vibrations of my watch was to remind me about tomorrow's
appointment with Calli.
I considered cancelling it and just avoid rescheduling.

I dread last sessions.
I hate closures.
What am I going to say?

Maybe that's why I avoided it a couple of years ago when I saw both her and
Owen at the same time for a couple of weeks.

Tomorrow I have my second session with Fabiola.
I had completely forgotten that I am supposed to go to a Hotel in vieux port
for a conference that same day.

### Monday, March 18th, 2024
"For one moment, let's just imagine that you could know exactly what will happen.
You have this magic crystal ball from where you can see into the future.
Pretend that you know that this will go on,
with occasional rencounters and intermittent communication, for the next six months.
How does knowing that make you feel?"

I could not fall asleep last night.

At around 1h30, I realized I forgot to take my sleep medication.
I hesitated about taking it.
The pharmacist warned me not to taken without the possibility of staying a full 7 hours in bed.
I had to leave before 9h for my therapy in the morning.

I woke up a couple of times with the sunrise.
I turned off the alarm before giving it a chance to sing.

I made a stop at the boulangerie and bought my usual breakfast.
I rode the orange line and the 24 bus until Mansfield stop.
I walked uphill McTavish until the Brown building,
where I sat on a table to eat my pastry and drink my coffee in the free hour that I had before my session.

When the time came and I went to the Wellness Hub, I was received by a new receptionist.
He asked me for my student's ID number.
I blanked out so I asked him to give me some time to take out my card.
He told me he had seen that I was registered for a follow-up.
After asking me if I knew the way, he sent me off.

I waited in the waiting room until Calli stepped out to let me in.

This was not our last session.
I did not bring up that I started therapy with another counselor.

During the first half I mentioned how,
accidentally, I cut myself on the wrist while doing the dishes yesterday.
It started stinging in a familiar way.

I kept glancing at the thin scarlet line on the side of my hand while
waiting to come in.

"Did it remind you of cutting yourself in a different way?"

Halfway through the session, during one of the moments that I fell silent,
she brought up an old subject.

"What happened with the person you had connected with,
did you ended up reaching out again after you met during valentine's?"

The second half of the session we spent talking about what has happened these past four weeks.
I talked about how I asked her out a las time as a desperate attempt to put an end to this crush.

I told her how we briefly touched the subject of meeting again.

"Still, I doubt that it will ever happen. I know there is no evidence to make me think of that..."

"Uh... well", she interrupted me mid-thought.

I talked about how, yet again, I am waiting for a text that might never arrive.

"I hate the idea that I am chasing her. In order to chase something, it means it's running away from you."

"Let me challenge that thought. Sometimes there is a thrill in chasing. Sometimes kids chase each other when playing tag. There are races. There are many other ways a chase might happen."

We set up an appointment in three weeks.

Tomorrow I am seeing Fabiola.

I think I'll come back home around 11h to have my session in here. The ride back home, including the walks to and from the metro station, is only 30 minutes.

After my therapy, I decided against going to the office. Instead of walking uphill towards the MNI, I went down all the way to station Bonaventure.

Walking home I felt like crying, much more than I did my entire therapy session.

Around noon, I grabbed a tote bag and went outside. My first stop was Tsikinis, where I bought a small container of hummus. Then I entered the dépanneur, from where I got a bag of sour cream and bacon chips and two bottles of zero-calories drinks. Lastly, I went to SAQ and got the bottle of Vodka that I had succesfully avoided buying these past few days.

I started drinking at around 15h.

I sent another day of my journal to Alda.

"This is the best written out of all that I've read [...] I really love this one. I think this should be the start of your book."

In French class, it was supposed to be la partie de l'evaluation concernant la production orale. The first half before the break, the prof sent us out to breakout rooms to practice the two dialogues. After the pause, he sent us in rooms again to wait for him to come evaluate us.

Time ran out and he brought us back. My Teams stopped working again while Segnio was telling him that I had a conference tomorrow and might not be able to make it. He waited another 10 minutes after class to evaluate our dialogues.

I can now skip French tomorrow evening.

### Wednesday, March 20th, 2024
"Have you tried not being anxious?"

Yesterday, I decided not to do the words.

I had plenty of time; both in the afternoon and at night. I didn't do it because I didn't want to.

It's 00h32 right now. Where this a night a couple of years ago and I wouldn't have bothered. I was coming on the metro and, before I missed my stop at Berri UQAM, I just remembered that I had a streak of more than 30 days.

This week is the conference of CCNA. It started yesterday morning. Last week I realized that I couldn't stay at home this Tuesday for my session with Fabiola since I had to go to the hotel for the conference.

The day before, as I am sure I wrote, I said in French class that I had a conference I needed to go to and it would be probably impossible for me to attend the next class. The professor understood and stayed a couple of minutes after the session to record the dialogues of me and Senio.

I went to bed with the alarm set for 6h. The plan was to get up, arrive in time for the breakfast, and stay until 11h. I had plenty of time to make it back home and connect for my session at noon.

The alarm sounded and I turned it off. I stayed in bed until later in the morning. I don't remember if I even got up to drink my coffee.

I did. I remember still drinking some during my session, which tells me that I must have gotten out of bed at around 11h.

Last night, one of the times I considered writing for the day, I thought about starting narrating the dream that woke me up.

For the conference today, I wore the pants I bought with Sonny. All day I felt self-conscious about the smell coming from my crotch. Every time I went to the restroom, I kept noticing my underwear being moist.

My dream started being about something like that, except the moisture in my underwear had a crimson colour. It had happened several times, but then one night, it wasn't just my underwear. The blood had transpired through my underwear and my shorts all the way to the sheets of the bed.

My mom noticed and was asking me about it. What was it all about? I said I didn't know.

"Sofía, are you getting your period?"

"How would I be getting a period? I don't have a uterus... I don't even have a vagina!"

Fabiola brought up my dissatisfaction, frustration and anger with my own body. I told her about my dreams, the one from that morning and the one I had years ago when I dreamed I had miraculously gotten pregnant.

I told her how, before transitioning I never imagined myself as a parent. I realized later that it had to do with me not ever wanting to be a dad. Now, more than a decade later, I feel heartbroken with the news of people I know having kids or even sometimes watching a couple of toddlers in a café in Verdun.

I talked about my history with self-harm; the recent scar that is still bright red on the side of my wrist. I told her about the first time that I cut myself back in the apartment at Fuentes Brotantes, and then one of the recent ones after the French class homework for which we were supposed to bring childhood pictures to be shown to a classmate and compared to how we look now.

I can barely remember what else did I do yesterday after the session ended. I know I asked Sonny to transfer her the money. I probably tried to work some more in the afternoon, even though I haven't finished preparing the documents for submitting the Qrater paper. I don't think I kept working on the journal. Did I just watch How I met your mother?

I drank. I served myself some vodka with the lemon sparkling drink I got myself at the dépanneur that day. I started drinking around the time that I was supposed to connect to class.

I don't remember exactly at around what time, María texted me to tell me that she had tried to connect to class from her phone, but it was impossible to follow up in the train. She asked me if I was still down to meet at the metro for going to the bowling alley.

I told her that I would have loved to, but I had a conference this week which would make it impossible for me to go.

"¿Cuándo te regresas a España? Hay que ver si alcanzamos a hacer algo antes de que te vayas."

She replied back yesterday telling me that good thing she had asked me because, without me, there was no point in her going either. She told me her availability after her trip later this week. We would have to meet between the 28th and the 31st.

When I went to bed last night, I, again, put the alarm for 6h.

This time it did get to sound. It woke me up from a dream where I was stealing my own bike. I postponed it another 9 minutes, but I couldn't fall back to sleep.

I showered and got ready. Like I wrote up, I put on my checkered pants and the top that looks like a sweater over a white shirt. I put on the blazer and, over it, the coat that Sonny left in here.

There were some white spread on the streets. Instead of the brown shoes that I had considered wearing, I put on the red boots before leaving my apartment.

I made it to the hotel at precisely 7h30. I saw how they were finishing setting up breakfast while I asked to register and picked up my credential and totebag. I walked back to the end of the corridor and put up my coat on a hanger from one of the two racks that where in front of the elevators.

By the tables where I just had registered, I recognized one of the women from CCNA that I met in Amsterdam. It was the Jewish woman who had worked in Israel. I don't think she recognized me.

I got a plate and served myself some food to have my first dose of medications. I took my breakfast and my cup of coffee to one of the empty round tables.

A neurologist sat a couple of chairs to my left. He started making small talk and, not much later, a woman he know sat a couple of seats away from him.

When Aliza and Walter got in, she asked me why I was sitting with strangers.

"Porque cuando me senté la mesa estaba vacía."

I finally met Amelie. The German girl in her lab of whom she's been talking about. She seemed nice. I got that same familiar feeling that she didn't like me.

After the talks in the morning, I went up in the elevator with Aliza's lab. I saw myself in the mirror besides Mahsa, Yashar, and Aliza. I hated what I saw.

I hated my clothes and they way my body looked in them. I hated how my hair looked after wearing gel instead of the cream. I hated the roundness of my face and the thickness of my neck. I didn't just feel fat, I felt unnatractive.

Despite all of that, I ate today more than I have eaten any other day of this year.

Aliza gave her talk. I noticed how she was feeling nervous. Her talk was good. She got one or two questions in the end. At first I waited for her to finish talking with some people from the audience. I saw the rest of her lab talking with each other waiting for her. I started feeling self-conscious and that I didn't belong before I walked out.

We went on break and I ate for the third or fourth time. I was with them again before leaving them and meeting with my own labmates. It wasn't until I joined Neda, Reza, and Mahdie, that I starting feeling self-concious of them having to switch to English because of my presence. They explained to me a little about the Iranian New Year before I abandoned them, too.

Was that the last talk? Was that the last think before the reception?

Mahsa asked me when was I graduating. She's looking for a Postdoc this summer.

We sat at another table and continued talking until they put up dinner and started serving alcohol. I got myself a glass of red wine and Aliza got herself a drink. Several times it happened the familiar moments where I say something that nobody hears. I was the person in whole table who spoke the least. Aliza had a second ticket and we shared a glass of white wine.

At around 20h, Aliza, Amelie, Mahsa, and Yashar left to the metro.

I went to McKibbins to meet with Alda.

"Dile a Alda que hice dramas porque no me invitó."

I got into the pub around 20 minutes of our agreed time. I got myself a dark & stormy and waited for Alda. After talking about our fixations, best kisses, and best sexual encounters, we finished our second cocktails.

Alda came with me to A&W where I got some fries to have the last dose of antipsychotics.

### Sunday, March 24th, 2024
"~Kath~; ~Valerie~; ~Max~; ~Monica~; ~Héloïse~; Now, Sophie."

Writing about 2015, when I intentionally stopped writing the day Monica decided she couldn't be my friend so the counter of continues days of writing in the journaling website would keep a tally of the number of days since her leaving feels so bizarre.

I haven't written anything for the past three days. I am not sure if there was a reason behind it.

Thursday I stayed home. I did not go to the CCNA conference in the morning, nor I went to the lab to meet with Louis at his office.

I sent him an e-mail asking about the meetings. I did meet with him on Teams. He didn't go to the conference either, since he had a meeting with some people. He actually moved Neda's and MohammedReza's meetings to Monday.

I have this idea that I did something on Thursday's evening since I was free from French. The rest of the week seems now like a blur.

I think Thursday evening was when I got myself some KFC from Uber Eats.

I have no idea what I did on Friday. I just know that it wasn't any work.

I also know that I've been drinking more than I should have. One of these days I went to the dépanneur at the corner of the street and got myself a six pack of Guiness. Last night that I went to Aliza's I brought two of the bottles to her house. In the fridge, I might not have any groceries other than three jalapeño peppers and two small red onions, but I do have half of the six pack left.

I had my list of people to reach out to keep me busy.

I replied to Kath's text asking about my mental health and moved on to continue reaching out to old, flared-out connections.

Thursday—it must have been—, I texted Valerie. I told her I had thought about her after seeing Love Lies Bleeding with Alda, and wondered how she was doing. I considered mentioning the raincheck she had given me to the movies. I don't even remember what was the movie that I ended up watching with Alda instead.

Friday morning I woke up to her conversation reborn. Her latest messages remain unopened there.

Aliza broke up with Ali.

Yesterday she texted me during the day to ask me if I was up to doing something that evening. Liana had asked her to do something. Going out would do me good, so I accepted without hesitation.

Later in the night, when I asked her about confirming the time, she let me know that Liana had not replied to her texts and that she had talked with Ali the night before.

"¿Todo chido?"

"No, le dije que terminemos. Ella estaba en otro punto. Estoy hecha bolita."

"¿En otro punto?, I'm sorry."

"Like, trabajando sus problemas y planteando qué quiere para luego llegar y que pudiéramos platicar y negociar la relación."

We settled on just going to her house to chill and watch something on the television.

I took my headphones for the commute and two bottles of Guinness for my visit.

We watched some New Girl and talked about her recently ended relationship. Aliza had been thinking about breaking up even before Ali had her latest mental health issue. She mentioned how she can't share spaces with some people who are an important part of Ali's life yet have political views completely opposed to who Aliza is as a jewish woman.

I left her house a a couple of minutes before midnight. I saw the 108 bus pass the stop before I had the chance to walk towards it. I ended up going to the same station from which I arrived to Verdun.

I had this idea of taking the green line until Berri UQAM and then grabbing the 30 bus. I got out of the station close to my first studio apartment in the city. I managed to get to the bust stop with plenty of time until the scheduled departure of the bus. There was a couple at the stop already waiting. The ETA of the bus kept decreasing in my phone until it reached the negative numbers. I decided to continue with the orange line.

I got home around 1h. I texted Aliza a summary of my odyssey a couple of blocks before I actually got home.

I had come half-convinced about the idea of doing the exact same thing I did earlier this month. I could text Sophie my proposition of coming over. She would either accept or deny it, which either option would put an end to my uncomfortable crush.

I don't know why even now, the third option of not responding at all—the actual thing that happened with the last text I sent her—does not seem viable in my mind.

I wrote two potential texts in my Notes app.

Never asked you—did you ever find someone to try out Trauma bonding(TM) the drinking game?

I could use your help! There's this girl I've gone on a couple of dates with. We haven't texted in a while, but she did say she'd be pretty busy. I really like her, though. Should I text her or let her be who reaches out? What do you think?

I was drunk last night, but not drunk enough to send either of them.

"No textees a esta hora personas con las que no hablas hace meses." Read Aliza's text at 1h45.

Despite taking my sleeping pills—unlike my second dose of antipsychotics—, I slept less than I thought I would have. I refined the potential texts in my phone and got out of bed with the full intention of going throught the list of names before earning my right to put an end to this unhealthy fixation.

I did not shower, but I put on the same outfit that I wore to Aliza's house. I grabbed my coat, my wallet and my headphones and I walked towards the bakery. I asked for my usual order and the baker pointed towards both the normal and almond croissants. I clarified my request and asked for a latté with it. I found a table in the back and sat down with my pastry. Like the times I had gone with Monica—did I go there with Sonny?—, I had to wait a while for my drink.

I had my breakfast listening to music and thinking about the messages that I would send today. I did not send any back then.

My plan was to get back home, grab my bags, and go to the IGA. I also did not do that.

Instead, I came back home and went back to bed. I slept for a couple of hours. When I woke up, I continued my conversation with Alda.

Two nights ago, at midnight, I had sent her a text that remained unresponded until this morning.

"I have two questions", I started like one of the options I was thinking of sending Sophie.

"1) Do you think that I haven't heard from Sophie for two weeks necessarily means she's not into me?

2) Let's go out with Lizzie, no? I dunno why I started thinking about her. Do you still have her scarf?"

When I woke up this morning, she had replied with a laugh and saying she does still have the scarf, and that, sadly, it probably did mean that. I shared with her my resignation that I'd end up texting Sophie pretty soon. She said back that Anthony had texted her something.

Now that I think back to the day, I both remember opening Max's conversation inside the bakery with a half-eaten croissant in front of me, and reading it lying on my bad after just waking up from my nap. When I opened it to send the message that I had refined with Alda's comments, I expected it to be empty. Instead, I read a comment on a story that read:

"I've always wanted to ead dumplings naked with the girlfriends."

"I know right. It would be the dream."

"I feel like the people from the restaurant might not love the idea, tho."

"Hmm, maybe not. Guess takeaways would have to be the way to go."

I shared the conversation with Alda and she got excited for me. Do it again. Do it again! She told me.

We had thought about texting her Hey, you're cute. Why did we never go out? When I confirmed with her our idea, she started having doubts.

"Hmm, maybe rethink it."

Alda asked me if I was into the idea of going somewhere for coffee, maybe Café Olimpico. A couple of hours ago, Aliza also invited me to join her with Liana and Leo at their club de corazones rotos. While both ideas were tempted, I declined them.

Max's was the first text I sent.

I muted the conversation so I wouldn't obsess over it. I didn't even care about the silence that would follow it, or the soft rejection that would come instead. It was just one small step towards a more important goal.

Later in the afternoon, I sat on my couch with HIMYM playing in the television and I picked and edited the pictures I took back in October of Monica with the film camera. An old debate was to whether text Monica those pictures or directly asking her what had happened with us. This afternoon, I did both.

Like Max's I muted the conversation and archive it. It was just another small step towards another goal.

I don't remember which of them was the one who texted back first.

I haven't opened either of the conversations.

Hey! Funny stuff, there's this girl I'm getting fixated on so I made up a list of people and old friends whom I could text instead. Soo, how's life been treating you?

I decided not to text that to the last girl of the list. I decided not to increase the number of people with whom I referred Sophie.

With Alda, I talked briefly about the small portion of text I could read from the notification. I shared also that, despite all my efforts to do it, I was starting to feel doubts about doing my end-goal.

"I think ph will miss you and might text you herself; or be very happy when you finally text her in like a week."

"Do you think?"

"Yeh, I do. I think she likes you."

I ordered myself the two burritos and, despite having the idea of leaving half of the meal for tomorrow, I ate them both. I might have acted impulsively, but, despite all of the texts I ended up sending today, I didn't send the one that I could have regretted the most.

Now, I think it's time go back to my list and open up the messages that I got, regardless of how much I don't want to do it.

"Hey! Nice to hear from you! Yes, I'm really eager to see it!" Starts Valerie's text. "I'm ok, but I've been better. I just started a 3 week medical leave today for burnout. But I've booked a flight to Argentina for next November, so I'm pretty excited! I also thought about you since I bought hopscotch." She ended her text with an old wink emoji.

"Heyy thanks so are you! I actually don't know lol", reads the notification from Instagram of Max's response.

Monica, the hardest one to open, says:

"Omg, te he querido escribir mil veces cuando veo algo o pasa algo pero me sentí como estorbo cuando fui contigo y se siente como si hubieras estado molesta conmigo. No te sentí muy contenta con mi presencia. Por ejemplo, parecías molesta cuando íbamos juntas en el metro. Sólo sonreías cuando veías tu teléfono—eso fue lo que más me dolió. O te molestaba si no me sabía qué camino tomar en el metro, me hacías examen y me incomodé mucho. God forbid I wanted a picture. O pareces turista, no sé, como si no fuera bienvenida o que lo que hiciera fuera de mal gusto."

"I felt unwelcome and yet I missed you very very much these months and it still hurts."

### Monday, March 25th, 2024
 Ne partez pas, j'vous en supplie restez longtemps. Ça me sauvera p't'être pas; non, mais faire sans vous j'sais pas comment. Aimez-moi comme on aime un ami qui s'en va pour toujours. Je veux qu'on m'aime, parce que moi, je sais pas bien aimer mes contours.

-Voilà, Barbara Pravi.

I didn't reply to all of the girls I texted, but I did reply to some of them.

If I didn't have to finish 750 words to mark the day off in this stupid website, I might be tempted to leave it there. What else is there to say?

The first women I texted to, was Max.

"Thanks! And I guess we can still fix that."

Soon it's going to be 24 hours since she saw it. There hasn't been a response. Surprisingly, I am fine with it staying there. I might prefer it to the idea of her coming back to reject me, as gently as it might be.

Then, I moved on to Monica. I opened her text and read it. Feeling unwelcome and missing you so so much, were the only bits that I got from the archived notification. The complete idea of her messages could have been summarized in those two brief sentences.

How could I summarize the response I gave her?

Last night, I told her that I really did not expect—much less intended—of her passing such a bad time the week she stayed with me. I could see how I acted the way she did. Which proved my point in a way about how being around her makes me hate myself.

That short exchanged reminded me how, years ago, she would list me the reasons in which I had fallen short somehow which would lead me to enlist now to her, the different ways in she had hurt me. I tried to avoid that last night.

I finished saying how the friendship was hurting me and maybe it was better for the both of us to put an end to it.

I archived the conversation so I had no idea whether she had seen my message nor when.

I kept drinking. I had the second burrito that I was supposed to leave for today. I went to bed and fell asleep.

The first time I woke up it was around 4h. I came outside the room straight to the fridge. I grabbed the bottle of sparkling water and swallowed a big gulp of cold water. The taste was awful. I filled my gray metal bottle with tap water and drank half of it. I emptied my bladder and went back to my bed to continue sleeping.

I know I dreamed something but I can't remember a single thing.

I turned off the first alarm at 7h45. I pushed it off until 8h45 and then turned that off as well. I got out of bed at around 11h.

I had considered going to the lab. That's what I told Aliza when I was at her house. She told me she would be going to hers as a way to distract herself with work. It sounded like a good idea.

The excuse that kept me in bed for most of the morning was the e-mail Louis sent about being late to the Neuro meeting. He would join us after, but we could start it ourselves on Teams. I thought about having to take my laptop or the webcam and figuring out where to connect the headphones.

I also still needed to finish with the Word documents for the submission of the Qrater article. Word on Linux is a mess. I could have worked on it during the weekend, but, as I told Aliza that same night, I try not to work on the weekends. It's a slippery slope where when I start working on weekends, I start slacking off during the week with the idea that I can remedy it on the off-days. This then leads me to feel stressed when I don't work those days either. When I least expect it, I end up feeling stressed about having to work 7 days a week.

I skipped breakfast, which meant skipping the morning antipsychotics.

I was supposed to go out to get groceries today. I have almost no food in my fridge anymore.

I didn't feel like going outside.

I did shower today.

Not before the meeting, though. I connected on Teams at the supposed time. I was the only one from Louis' lab not at the MNI. That's not true, I think I saw Vicky's name as well.

It was Alfonso's turn to present something. He showed this Chinese paper of the changes in CSF biomarkers up to 20 years before diagnosis of dementia. For some reason I was focused on his accent or lack therof. It got stronger when he got nervous. I think that happens to me, too. It was also how I noticed that Aliza was nervous when she presented at CCNA.

I didn't pay much attention to the presentation given. I did not read the paper. I did not even turn my webcamera on.

The talk started and ended and I got nothing out of it. Did Louis note my absence?

Do I hope he did?

I kept working on the Qrater submission. I finished updating the page and line numbers of the responses to the reviewers comments. When I was all done and ready to start the submission, I opened the e-mail that Louis had forwarded me from Justine. I read the instructions she had given us, which told us to base our submission on the author's guidelines of the journal. I never thought about checking the journal's guidelines.

Fortunately, the first important change that needed to be done on the manuscript was to update the reference style from APA to AMA. I dreaded having to manually re-register the references one by one, but that ended up not being necessary. I went into the Zotero options within Word, and the document updated without many issues.

The second change, putting all of the figures and tables inline with the text was harder and more time expensive.

I was still working on that when I got the notifcation in the Whatsapp Windows application from Monica. Without opening the conversation, by just hovering my mouse over her name, I could read the entirety of her message without intention.

"Okay, me tomó digerirlo porque lo leí noche y toda con sueño y dejame ver...

"En el primer párrafo dices que te odiabas a ti misma, pero no entiendo, ¿cómo eso se reflejó conmigo y con los demás no? En el último párrafo dices que no nos hacemos bien. ¿Cómo te he lastimado yo?—Realmente quiero saber en qué momento para no repetir lo que dije o algún comportamiento a lo mejor?

"Ahora, ¿sentirte bien contigo misma en qué sentido? ¿Por qué nomás me lastimas a mi? ¿Por qué con otra gente estás bien? ¿Por qué con otros no tienes que romper amistad?

"Respeto tu decisión ni intento cambiarla, será como tú quieres pero sólo quiero saber para darle sentido y no tener yo que andar pensando en razones que tal vez no son."

I answered her in the best way I could. I feel tempted just to type now my long messages to her—which would help me complete the missing 300 words that I need to fix another missing day.

I developed the idea of how she brings out the worst in me. I kept saying over and over that I hate myself. I mentioned my body and my weight. I talked about me interrupting her or talking over her. It only happened with her. And it happened, I noticed it.

To Aliza I did mention the dysphoria, but in my messages with Monica I tried to stay as far away from that as possible.

I briefly mentioned how I did wanted her to leave so I could get home and cut myself. I hesitated telling her how that was the last time that I did it, but it felt cruel making the point that I haven't done it since she was out of my life when I know very well that I have been tempted and that the rest of the times I did it, it had nothing to do with her.

I talked briefly about therapy, specifically how it was about another relationship of mine that suddenly ended the moment I stopped reaching out, another lumber in the fire that is my abandonment issues; and, generally how I started seeing a new therapist.

"I don't want you to think that I hate you, or that I think you're a bad friend. It's not even that I don't ever want to see you again nor I want you out of my life. For some reasons I can't explain, I hate myself more when I'm around you, sometimes even after talk. I thought it was only hurting me, but now I see I also hurt you with my actions. I have to deal with accepting myself and stop hating me, until then, maybe me being your friend is not healthy for either of us."

Tomorrow I am seeing Fabiola.

In the evening I'll meet Aliza and Liana.

Now, I'll just finish my glass of Vodka and go to bed.

### Tuesday, March 26th, 2024
"Lo siento, no hablo francés."

I am sitting at a table inside Thomson House. It is the same room where I described strangers after meeting Aliza. I glance in that direction and see the two people sitting in those tables. To my left, on the table where I met with Sophie on Valentine's day, there is a guy clicking on his mouse while working on his laptop.

I asked one of the two men sitting to my right to watch my stuff while I went to the restroom to check if the stench of shit that I keep smelling was coming from me.

I postponed the alarms again. I didn't want to get up nor stop dreaming. I can't remember a single detail of my dreams, yet I am convinced they were better than this reality.

I showered and put on some clothes. I am wearing the pants that I bought from Sonny. I am also wearing a blue long sleeve shirt, on the first women's items of clothing that I bought almost a decade ago. It's boxy and comfortable and it says boyfriend style on the label.

I went to the pharmacy first to pick up my hormones. There is not much to tell about that interaction. I got in, I asked for them by giving my name, payed and denied needing a bag.

On the same street, I made a stop at the bakery. I ordered the usual stuff and a large latte. I had to clarify that I want them to eat in place. I grabbed a table but I did not stay for long.

I thought I was doing alright with the effects of the antipsychotics, but I am starting to feel them just now a quarter of the day after.

I had my kindle with my in the bakery, but the story didn't grab my attention for long.

I got back home with an hour to spare before my session with Fabiola.

I sat down and logged to Zoom punctually. I was not bothered by the 5 minutes I waited for her to connect. I've gotten used to waiting for Calli.

In the morning, a bit after getting out of bed, I got the notifications of Alda's message. She was telling me that despite eating the numerous lindt chocolates during the weekend, she was doing quite well with the slimming plan. She was 76.9kg this morning.

I thought about these past few days, the increasing amount of alcohol, the several take-out orders. Just now I am considering walking to the bar and getting myself a pint of beer. The only thing stopping me is the social embarrasment of being the only person drinking at 14h.

"I won't weight myself until the 1st but I think I might be 80-81", I replied to her.

"I'll probably text ph today", I added as a PS.

I did end up weighting myself—less than I was expecting, at 79.15 kg—and I haven't send any texts.

Just after finishing this last sentence I grabbed my phone and considered replying to Héloïse's response. Last night—or was it the day before?—I replied to Valerie and she agreed that we should hang out soon. She would go see the movie we talked about and would let me know her thoughts.

Reaching out to old friends—are they really friends if all of those relatinships started as potentially romantic?—didn't work out as well as I was expecting. The closest that did it was Max's response, which led to nowhere.

That list as defense mechanism to my own crush-driven impulses was one of the two main topics I was one of the two things I wanted to talk about with Fabiola.

Our session started by her asking me how I had been. I lied and said well. I could have mentioned the late abuse of alcohol, but I didn't think of it.

I told her how sometimes I don't know what to talk about in session; I can't seem to pick a subject important enough to dedicate my therapy to it. This was not one of those times. I had identified two themes, probable interconnected with each other, that I wanted to touch. I just couldn't decide between them.

She instructed me to take my time, see how I felt, and which one—or both—of the subjects did I want to board.

I started talking about this girl I've been gone on a couple of dates with. I told what has happened since mid December. The first conversation, her asking me out on the first date, and me reaching out again when I came back weeks later. I talked about the first cancellations and the encouraging although intermittent texts. I broached the second short date on the table to my left where now there's a guy and a girl sharing a plate of nachos, and finally mentioned my latest attempt of finishing my crush by asking her out a last time fully expecting a no for an answer, but which resulted in a last encounter that was even better than the first one.

I feel pathetic by just summarizing this past few months, by how much I am still fixated on this person. Calli would make me be aware of how I am back to my old habit of harshly judging myself and distancing myself from my own feelings.

I am not the first person who has ever had a crush on a stranger.

Am I gonna try to reach the 1500 words needed to fix the several days that I did not write?

Sophie warned me during our date that the next two weeks would be very busy . Fabiola noticed that, according to the timeline of my own narration of the events, those two weeks have already passed.

At this point I mentioned the list of people I could reach out instead and how in that list was Monica.

I then summarized as briefly as possible what has happened with Monica since her visit to Montréal this past Autumn.

The woman with short hair that was sitting at the table in front of me who left 15 minutes ago just came back and was going to sit on the table to my right. She put her backpack on the chair and her helmet on the table. She didn't take her green windbreaker off before she gathered her stuff and left again. Did she leave because of me?

There are now a group of people who got to the table.

I talked about Monica's visit, I described as best as I could the feelings of self-hate and inadequacy that rose during her stay, I mentioned how our conversation after her departure felt different and my initial attempt to break the silence by asking her how she was doing after not hearing from her for a couple of weeks.

I told her that the day she left, it was the last time that I've cut myself.

She asked me how Monica was.

I blanked. I could not answer her at all.

"¿Tienen cosas en común?"

I couldn't not answer that either.

In those brief moments, Monica felt so far away and untoachable that for a minute I might have even forgotten her face.

I cried. I cried so much that I felt a bit empty when the tears finally stopped coming out.

When I thought about those two subjects, I made the connection that these issues were with me ending the connection with the first girl I kissed and dreading that a connection will never start with the last girl I kissed.

I told Fabiola the important detail that was missing from my narration, how it was that Monica and I met, how our relationship was not always platonic.

"Ese es un detalle importante."

I don't remember if it was me or her that brought up the possibility that her being from my past could be one of the reasons that I felt the way I did. I told her that other than my family, I don't have any other connection to my life as a man.

She asked me, then, about my friendships with people from high school, from college.

I follow Manuel and Alan on Instagram. The former has recently finished his oncology residency in Mexico City and is now back in Tijuana. The latter is married, I suppose, and has now one or two children. I haven't talked to them in years.

I stopped following all of the members of the team of 7, except Anahí. Paola A's Diego must be now in the middle of elementary school. Eusebio and Jessica are married, I have no idea if having children is in their plans for their near future. Catherine must have finished her degree by now. I haven't talked to them, including Anahí, in years either.

When I was building my list, neither of their names ever came as potential people I would like to reach out to.

I don't think my name comes up in their minds.

When my session ended, I put on some make up and came to Thomson House to work for a bit before the evening.

In Jarry station, I saw an old man talking to a girl with short hair wearing a beanie. I passed them and sat on a bench. The man came and with him a stench of feces or decay, both of them sat next to me. After a moment, he touched me on the arm. I didn't put down my headphones and lied to him in Spanish that I didn't speak French.

I changed from the orange line to the green one. I decided not to seat.

When I got off at Peel, another person approached me on the street. I took off my headphones. In English he asked me if I could spare any dollars for food. This time I just walked away without lying.

When I came to Thomson House, I felt like the stench had followed me here.

Maybe I deserve it.

### Wednesday, March 27th, 2024
"Never asked you—did you ever get to try out Trauma Bonding(TM) the drinking game?"

Aliza texted me yesterday's afternoon to let me know they were on their way to Church. I had already paid my bills, so I just finished the pint of cider that I had with my burger and went on my way to catch the 107 bus.

I could have probably taken the metro instead and made it to the pub much earlier. The bus was delayed a couple of minutes. I stayed on the bus stop watching the people walking downhill and repressing the thought that it was around 45 minutes too late for me to coincidentally encounter anyone getting out of their job.

The bus rode the traffic of Montréal downtown and left me across the street from Church. Aliza's message half an hour earlier had told me that they were downstairs. The main area seemed empty and I didn't find them, so I assumed she meant they were in the back where the pool table is.

The first person I saw was Mahsa, standing behind the people sitting on the chairs across the black couch. She recognized me and everyone said Hi. Liana was sitting in one of those chairs. I think Amelie was to her side. Walter was sitting on the edge of the couch. Vlad was in the back playing pool with somebody.

Mahsa told me to leave my stuff at the table they had taken on the other end of the room.

I sat on the corner. When Yashar came to say hi, for some reason I stood up. Was I waiting for a hug or a hand-shake?

"Why did you get up?"

They had just finished ordering their food and the waitress was leaving. I quickly thought on my feet.

"Oh, no reason... well, I am not going to eat, so I can stand."

Someone asked me why I was not eating. I made a comment about my late lunch at Thomson.

People had their food at the coffee table in front of the couch. On the table, we played an over-sized version of jenga. Mahsa, Liana, Roya, and Walter made comments about how easy I made it seem.

Why did their comments make me uncomfortable?

I almost wanted to mess up on purpose. I kept expecting to suddenly tear down the tower and everyone's high expectations of me.

The waitress came back with a guy asking us in French which of the two spaces we were going to keep. Liana had said since the very beginning that we should move to the tables. The guy was going to record a Podcast with three other people. After a bit of discussing it within the group, everyone took their plates with them to a chair of the tables.

Since earlier in the afternoon, I had resigned myself that I would send the text to Sophie. It was time to end things. As soon as I had come to terms with my own impulses, I started feeling nervous about it. I was—even now—not ready to let this fantasy go.

While I was sitting down at the corner of the bar, talking about movies with Yashar and Aliza, I looked at my phone and saw the time. The appropriate window of sending a text after work was closing down. I put the phone down and gave them my two options for favourite movie.

The pitchers kept coming.

They picked up the Jenga game, but the tower fell before the turn to go came back to me.

Liana seemed upset that the conversation turned into a Lab meeting, when they started proposing people to fit the role of most something. Someone came up with the idea of turning it around and fitting the adjective to the person, but then the game died. At this point I knew that Liana had invited the full CoBraLab to her birthday—the same Lab that is larger than Aliza's and mine combined—and not a single person had come.

Roya invited me to play pool with them. I was on Aliza's team and we played against Walter and Amelie.

"Wey, quiero tanto alburear a Amelie, pero no sé cómo hacerlo en inglés.", Aliza told me after Amelie said something.

"It's OK, I know you don't have much experience with sticks." I told Aliza after her turn when she missed her shot.

Amelie heard me and she laughed.

"Sofía, jugabas mucho pool en Tijuana?", Walter asked me on my turn before I took the shot.

"Ah", he answered himself after it.

We lost after I socked the 8-ball. For some reason, it felt much better being bad at a game.

I finished the 750 words and last night has still not ended. I guess I can push it to the 1500. Does this have anything to do with the fact that I told myself I would not open the messages app nor start worrying about replying back until after I finished with these words?

The night was not much longer.

Vlad was the first to leave. He came back half an hour later because he had forgotten his backpack.

Zacky and Walter then stood up announcing they were gonna go. Aliza told everyone she had ordered dessert for everyone. They stayed for around another half an hour. I finally tried the fried oreos.

Mahsa, Roya, and Liana were really drunk. Later that night, when I was waiting for the bus with Aliza and Liana, Aliza told Liana how with me it's not very obvious when I am drunk. I confessed to them that I was already tipsy when I arrived in the afternoon from Thomson House.

For one moment while everyone was still there, Roya stood on my side and put her arm around my shoulders. Surrounded by her warmth, I kept jumping between feeling very relaxed and really tense.

I took a look at phone, but I haven't opened the conversation at the top, nor any of the other ones with notification dots next to their names.

Liana, Aliza, and I were the last ones to leave after everyone paid for their bills. Mahsa and Yashar paid for three of the pitchers. I didn't have any food, so I just paid for a fourth of a pitcher. The three of us stayed for a bit while they finished their last glasses.

We are going dancing this Saturday. I asked Aliza about it this morning when I told her my suspicions that Vlad had not paid after noticing how Amelie paid for the four shots they took. We're going to someplace close to station Mt-Royal around 21h. When Aliza told me she saw Vlad pay.

"No puedo acordarme de otra vez pero siento que no ha sido la primera vez que nos cobran de más."

"Cuando estaba Ali aquí y fuimos con unas brasileñas."

"Gala night, ya me acordé. Cuando iba con vestido negro y todo."

I thought I could wear that dress again Saturday.

We left the bar early and waited for the bus around 15 minutes. I rode it with Liana and we left Aliza on the corner of L'Eglise and Verdun.

I made it home without sending the text. It was too late to send anything or to have dinner. I had my hormones pill without the antipsychotics.

I did have some dinner later. I made use of the buy 1, get 2 offer from A&W and got myself two beyond burgers and fries. I had the intention to leave the second burger for this morning's pills—I even put it in the fridge—, but I had it 5 minutes after finishing the first one. Similarly to today's text at luch time, I regretted it moments after the first bite when it was already too late.

I was not as drunk as Aliza's labmates or co-supervisor.

This morning I was just tired. I know I dreamed something interesting, worthy of having written about it, but I have forgotten all about it.

I had my coffee despite getting out of bed at 11h.

"I haven't texted ph yet and I had given myself permission to do it today, but it's getting late." I texted last night to Alda when I was at Church.

"Yeah, I think just get it done with at this point." She replied back later in the night.

She added a picture of a page from the investment book she's reading in French, on which the author cites a book from a nurse in a paliative care unit mentioning the top 5 regrets expressed by her patients. Alda noted down the third one, which read J'aurais voulu avoir le courage d'exprimer mes sentiments.

I know I am going to be sad. I told Fabiola that the most frustrating thing about all of this, is that I am sure that, no matter what happens, everything is going to end in disappointment for me and I can't seem to do anything about it.

I propose Alda to go get drunk at Bifteck and eat wings at pizza pizza.

After getting an e-mail from Louis notifying me he was going to raise our salaries—he'll pay me 32k, even more than what the IPN suggests—, I told Alda that I would pay for it.

"BTW, do we have to wait 'till she breaks your heart to go to bifteck?"

"It's going to happen soon; probably by next weekend at the latest (not passover's, the other one)."

I told her what I had texted and argued my case further.

"1. She won't reply by next weekend: we drink.

"2. She's like Hey Sofía, sorry about not reaching out. I don't think there's a romantic connection, bla bla bla: we drink.

"3. She says Yes or No. I say Wanna come over one of these days and play with a bottle of wine? And then, either option 1 or 2 happens: we drink."

Alda said OK and then proposed going to the brewery by my house before that.

"Ya mandé el mensaje y tengo un   6   grandote arriba de mi app de mensajes de otras mujeres—incluyendo mi mamá—, pero tengo ansiedad de abrirla." I texted Aliza today.

The number is still 6. Sophie's is still the only conversation without a blue dot from the 5 ones in there. The message is still unseen.

### Friday, March 29th, 2024
You will be shocked, kids, when you discover how easy it is in life to part ways with people forever. That’s why, when you find someone you want to keep around, you do something about it.

-Ted; How I met your mother.

Yesterday it was the first time that I had gone to the lab in quite a while. I can't even remember the last time. I took the 24 bus and walked up Rue Aylmer all the way to the entrance of the gymnaseum parking lot. There is still work going on Av des Pins.

"Long time no see!" Said Vlad when I got into the office and put my backpack on the chair.

"How are you? " Asked me Neda with a concerned look on her face while I was taking my denim jacket off. "Are you good?"

Am I really?

I sat down in front of my desk. I put the blue brain they gave me at the CCNA conference next to the purple one from The Neuro, and got to work. I waited a little bit before taking the sandwich I made myself at home for breakfast and nibble on it in order to take my pills.

I had scheduled the meeting with Isabel at 15h. I decided against bringing the laptop, so I hoped to catch free the videoconference booth in the Atrium. Neda told me how Louis had sent Daniel, Mohammedreza, and her a separate e-mail about definitely scheduling a meeting with Isabel. They all would connect with her at 15h30.

I went to the office for my 1-on-1 with Louis. We talked about scheduling my committee meeting before this summer. He sent me a screenshot of his calendar for the latest weeks of May. We talked about Isabel, and how she could work on Mediotemporal Lobe segmentation with super resolution and deep learning.

"But, I can leave that project for you if you want it," he continued. "Really, I am more than happy to keep paying you for another year or two."

We talked briefly about my plans for the future.

When our meeting ended, I had enough time to come back to the office and grab my headphones and water bottle. The booth was empty and I met Isabel.

I couldn't think of things to ask her. Our 30-minute videcall lasted 15 minutes.

Vlad, Mohammedreza, Neda, and Daniel—the last one remotely from his apartment—met Isabel. I was just out of the screen. A couple of times I just waved my hand in the camera's view—like when Isabel asked if there was anyone with a medical or biological background.

When the call ended Neda went out with Madhie and Vlad to pick up his glasses for the sun eclipse next week. I stayed chatting with Mohammedreza. He was telling me about the TAs manifestations. I thought both of Amelie, since she also made mention of it at CCNA, and Sophie, because of her union work.

I keep deleting and restoring conversations. Deleting the conversation with the last message was a mistake. Had I been able to see that my last message the morning after our encounter remained unopened I would not have sent anything further. Had I a margin of reference of how long it took her to open the last one, I would have avoided the anxiety that is that this last one will stay ignored.

I must let this go. This is clearly not working for me.

I wanted to end this. That was the whole point of reaching out one last time. Her silence should be the signal that this has come to a natural end.

I was just expecting that, even in rejection, it wouldn't have come to an end like this.

At around 17h, I decided to come home. I walked the way to station Sherbrooke. There were more people in the station than usual. A train in direction to Côte-vertu had its doors open. The voice from the speakers announced la interruption du service until 17h45.

Then it was to 18h, which then became 18h15. I think the last one was 18h30.

During the wait, I got a text from María. She had just gotten plans for the weekend, but we could meet that evening at a bar that might be around my area. I confirmed without hesitation. I could meet them there around 22h.

The metro started working again. The train that was already there closed its doors and left the station. Two other trains would  follow it in that direction before mine arrived. It came full. Two years living in Mexico City made it easy to find a way to make myself fit.

I got home but I can't remember what I did until the afternoon. I probably finished watching How I met your mother.

I grabbed the 193 bus that people get in line in front of station Jarry to take. I would need to get off and take the 10 towards east. The app kept changing itineraries as it guesses if I were going to be able to do the transbordation or not.

I did.

I  joined them in the bar and met her boyfriend. I felt uncomfortable for a bit speaking in Spanish, but it went away fast enough.

They paid for my beer.

When we said our good-byes, María told me to visit them whenever I went to Spain. I really considered it. It's been 10 years since the last time I was over there. She hugged me and we parted in opposite directions.

This time I would also need to take two buses. The first got delayed enough that the app was sure that I would not be able to catch the second in time. Since I hadn't spend any money, I decided to take an Uber home. I ordered it to take me to the A&W close to my house.

I remember now that I did eat a salad before leaving the house in the evening. I did not take my pills because of the fear that I would struggle with its effects before the bar, just as I am doing right now.

The Uber picked me up. The driver asked me if I had ordered share after she was instructed to pick someone else up on her way. I confirmed and asked her if she knew if she was going to pick him up from the right or the left, but I don't think I made myself be well understood.

He got in and spoke in English.

They left me in front of the burger place. This time, instead of getting a beyond burger, I ordered a chicken one. It was still warm when I got home after 5 or 7 minutes of walking.

Last night, before meeting with María and Guille, I talked with Alda about drinking on Sunday. I want to get really drunk. I offered of going to bifteck and eating wings at pizza pizza. Because it will be Easter, I am not sure the places will be open. I could also buy a bottle of amaretto and grapefruit juice, I offered her.

She proposed to invite Vero and Aliza. I did invited Aliza.

"Hey, I'm totally not getting ahead of myself after just 24h of waiting for the reply of a text, but do you wanna join me and Alda for the occasion of me getting shitfaced this Sunday for completely no reason and definitely not because of a girl I went on three dates with?"

With Veronica, it's not that I don't want her to join us. I feel embarrased about the reason that I want to drink.

"So, le prometí a Liana el karaoke, pero avísame su plan y yo les voy diciendo cómo voy,"  said Aliza.

"Sí, si no se arma, no worries—me das excusa de hacer v2.0 con el broken hearts club," I answered, "pero ya quiero que sea closure de beber y de mi crush así que please sí ven. Quiero empedarme al punto que no me queden ganas de volver a tomar ni de tener crushes."

After my burger and my pills, I went to bed at around 2-3h

This morning I got up just to drink my coffee and had a peanut butter toast breakfast. I went back to take a nap.

I fell asleep considering the idea of proposing to hook up to Jerica, the girl I went on a 9h date at Canal Lachine almost a year ago. The only reason that I didn't despite being fully aware that it was a horrible idea was that I have deleted her phone number from my phone.

Even though I had just masturbated a bit before my nap, I had a sensations-only dream in which a body-less person was having sex with me.

My plan was to not get back into the dating apps until summer or when I weighted 72kg.

I downloaded both tinder and hinge. I recreated the accounts in both.

I have deleted the applications again, but the accounts remain open gathering the judgemental views of strangers.

### Saturday, March 30th, 2024
"A ver, una cosa es voy a estar ocupada y no te voy a buscar. Otra es  ahorita estoy ocupada, pero respondo cuando tenga un rato. Y otra es paso días sin contestar. Aunque conteste este mensaje, ¿cuántas veces se puede repetir este ciclo?"

I have around 20 minutes to finish today's entry before I need to leave to catch the 30 bus. I am all changed and ready, it's just a matter of peeing, putting on my jacket and boots, grabbing my pills, and heading out.

I don't think I will be able to do it.

I had sleep paralysis again. It had to do with DC characters and a movie theater. I was going to be put on through psychological trauma and I couldn't move nor wake up. It didn't last too long.

After that, I continued dreaming about my family. It had something to do with having my kids—me not being able to—and my mother somehow being unsupportive of my transition. She used my deadname in the dream.

The last person who said it outloud was Monica. She referred to a moment in the past and, I guess, was not familiar with it being a faux pas.

I got out of bed at around noon. I did not have coffee, just breakfast. After it, I returned to bed.

I have been going back to the apps. I know they favour new members. While I don't have any matches on hinge, 4 people have liked my profile. On Tinder, I have 5 matches. Just now I was talking with Jay.

In her bio she stated that she was looking for good times. I asked her about it. She was the first person to ever reply back in Tinder. She talked about going on dates or having respectfully hookups. She threw back the question at me.

"Myself, while I'm not closed to the idea of dating and seeing what develops, being completely open, I reopened tinder after a dating break with casual sex in mind."

She confessed that she was also leaning into the casual sex aspect and invited me to keep chatting in there or moving on to meet in person.

I can't do it. I'll continue when I get back.  I'm home again.

I really considered ordering another buy-1-get-1-free burgers from A&W and try to have the second one for breakfast tomorrow, but managed to control myself. I can just skip the pills.

Before leaving the house I was talking with Jay on the app. I told her I was trans and she reassured me that it was not a dealbreaker for her—her profile stated she was pansexual—but she did want to know what that meant for me sexually.

We were in the middle of our sexual conversation when a notification popped up on the top of my screen. As soon as I saw the cat, I took a screenshot of it.

"Hey! I did not—to be honest I have not been doing super well physically since..."

I apologized to Jay about getting distracted and I continued answering her questions.

I considered telling her that I could meet her tonight after the bar. She told me that we could meet later, after Tuesday would work better for her.

I grabbed the 30 bus. Aliza texted me a picture of her conversation with Liana where Aliza lets her know that she has arrived and Liana answers that she's still at her house. I was a just a couple of stops behind.

I got to the bar. Aliza was talking with some men outside the door. The bar was closed and it wouldn't open until 22h. The guy she was talking to was a French man who knew how to speak Spanish.

Aliza and I went into a tapas bar and got some food and drinks waiting for Liana. We asked for a table for three people. They host asked us if we had a reservation but sat us anyway. Liana arrived with two of her friends a quarter before 22h. They sat with us while I payed for our things.

We danced in the bar to rock music. I liked it and had fun.

Several times I would grab my phone with the intention of opening the message and reading it fully. I think the first time it was at the tapas place next door—it might also had been after ordering my beer—when I opened the notifications and couldn't help not reading further than what the first notification had showed me.

Why am I so scared of reading her rejection if I was more than ready to drink tomorrow for the occasion of letting her go?

## April, 2024

### Thursday, April 4th, 2024
"...our date. Currently waiting on a huge batch of bloodwork to figure out what's going on (also, sorry for ghosting since then, I have been struggling to stay in touch with folks, so I'm probably going to be taking it easy from here and am definitely not in a place to actually be dating while I get my stuff together physically.)"

I had invited Alda and Aliza to come to my house on Sunday. I first invited Alda. She suggested to tell Aliza and Vero about my plans to get stupidly drunk. I decided not to tell Vero due to the embarrasment I feel about doing all this for a girl I barely know. Aliza had plans with Liana about going Karaoke-ing, so she said she might join us depending on the time.

The night before, as I decided to not open Sophie's text, I thought how I could wait until the next day that Alda would be here. I was sitting on the couch already changed and with make-up on my face, phone in hand, and I was aware that depending on the content of the text, I might cancel the night out and stay home. I felt it coming.

The next day, Alda ended up not coming and I spent the evening just with Aliza.

I finished a bit more than half of the bottle of Amaretto all by myself. I did not puke this time.

It's Thursday, the bottle is not yet empty, but it might be before I finish this journal entry.

I did not answer the text until Monday morning. By then—maybe even Tuesday—I was still fantasizing about the possible scenarios that would lead me to hear back from Sophie in the future. Alda liked my idea of ending my response with a gentle don't lose my number. Aliza convinced me it was better to drop it.

I don't remember when exactly in this time window on which I haven't written did I open the apps again. My oldest Tinder match is from March 30th. Facts say that I recreated my profiles even before opening Sophie's text. It still feels wrong, somehow.

I went on three dates with Sophie in a period of four months. She came and left my life without me telling her that I am trans.

In these past week that I am again dating, I haven't gone out with a single person yet, but I've come out _ times.

Jay, Kayla, Marie-Anne, Eva, Gabrielle, Sy, Typhaine.

I, just like two years ago, am trying to fill something void inside me with empty promises of sex—or is it affection?—from strangers.

Jay was one of the first matches I had. Her conversation dates back to the 30th. I started it asking her to specify what kind of good times she was looking for. She mentioned both casual dates and hooking up. For the first time since I've opened the app, I told her I was not interested in dating and wanted just casual sex.

My forwardness, like later me disclosing that I am trans, did not put her off. She asked me if I wanted to continue chatting in the app or if I wanted to meet in person right off—I remember now; I considered meeting her but I told her I had just 30 minutes to continue talking before I had to leave to meet my friends for a night of dancing. Sophie's notification came right in the middle of that conversation.

I must have already talked about Jay, then, since I remember now how I wrote about the notification in my entry from last month.

We were supposed to meet today. I sent her a text—this time after reading Sophie's—later in the week asking her if she was free to meet some day soon. She told me how she had just put her dog down, so, while she was down to meet, sex would have to wait a bit longer. We tentatively agreed on meeting today, but purposefully I gave her the option to confirm this morning.

"It's a bit stupid : with the fatigue, my emotions are fluctuating more than usual and the snow brings back memories (my dog loved playing in the snow) and grief in a stronger wave. I know it's not really stupid, but it feels reductive to say it like that."

Of course I had no issue with it, and I let her know.

Kayla was another of my first matches from that first night. In her profile it says how she's looking for hook ups and can host.

"Heyy, you're cute and just looking for a hook-up?" I sent her. "Also is that a bee suit?"

She replied the following afternoon about how she used to do beekeeping. After asking me if I have ever tried it, she continued.

"And I think you're cute, too. Yeah, just looking for a hook up. Wanna come over to my place sometime, have a drink and some fun ?"

I told her that I would love to and then, like an afterthought, disclosed that I am trans. I haven't heard from her since and probably never will.

Marie-Anne and Eva are the two francophones—Québécoise the former, French the latter—with whom I chatted on Tuesday before falling asleep. While Marie-Anne's match takes precedence, I'll talk about Eva first.

After we matched on Hinge, I asked her—in English—how long has she been in Montréal. We talked about our hometowns and feeling homesick. We continued talking about the beauty of Europe, travelling, and the difficulty of making québecois friends.

For one moment, the conversation turned awkward when, after talking about languages I asked her about her French accent. I confessed that I sometimes wished my hispanic accent in English were stronger at the same time that I am insecure about my strong accent in French, which is not cute unlike the French accent in English.

"Whenever I take you out," I started, "I won't know if asking to talk in English to hear your accent or in French to practice my conversation skills and prove it to you."

"I think that you don't have to worry about that. English is not our first language, I have my accent and I am not bilingual. As long as I am understood that's ok and I can improve.

"Et alors veux-tu parler un peu en français ?"

The rest of the conversation we continued in French. We talked about our jobs—my PhD and hers in dubbing—and my tendency to push people away.

"J'espère que je t'ai pas fait peur avec ma fixation avec l'accent français ou mes red flags prématurés. Salut ! Texte-moi bientôt si tu veux", I sent her after apologizing about going to bed.

"Oh non du tout. Bonne nuit, à très vite." She replied. I decided to let her text me again. I am not sure yet if I believe she will.

My chat with Marie-Anne back in tinder that same night started in French. That same Tuesday, the next day, I picked it back up from the silence.

"Dis-moi que tu parles anglais aussi, je sais pas comment bien flirter en français."

The conversation easily continued the rest of the night in English, until, just like with Eva, I apologized about having to go to bed and asked her to text me soon.

"We can continue in French or I can try to actually be flirty to make the English worthwhile."

"Is it soon enough?" She sent me the next day before noon. As easy as we had started, we have continued talking until this moment.

Gabrielle's conversation started in Hinge—where we first matched—that same Tuesday evening and has continued sporadically throughout the week with quick exchanges of questions and answers.

"J'ai voulu voir si c'etait match ici aussi, haha, appli de rencontres bingo," I sent her on Tinder where we matched as well shortly after.

"Clairement c'est un signe." She said.

It wasn't.

Today she asked me out in a similar way to how I did Tirza.

"I had a plan that got cancelled for tonight if ever you are interested for drinks. I live in Hochelaga."

I thought it would be the perfect time to come out. I did not feel as attracted to her, so where it to go badly, it wouldn't be much of a loss.

"I'd like to see you, but, before scheduling the date, just to let you know since it's not obvious from the pics, I'm trans.

"I used to have this personal rule—that I seemed to be breaking a lot lately—about telling before the first date, in case it's a deal breaker not to waste either of our times."

"Oh okay, thanks for telling me. I have never been on a date with a trans person before. I already dated a non binary person who was a lesbian. I am gay. To me this means I am attracted to women. Or a person who identifies as a woman I guess. But if you have not completely transitioned, I honestly don't know if I can be attracted to you sexually. I feel bad saying this. And it must be hard for you to have to tell people about it. If you don't want to tell me that's very okay, too.

"I would be interested in meeting you anyway. I think we could have nice conversations as friends, and then see where it brings us. I am not closed about romance. I just honestly don't know if I will be attracted or not."

I tried to reassure her, answer her indirect question about my genitals, and try to clarify what she meant.

She offered to send me an audio after asking me if I understood French. I felt anxious about not understanding her and about what her words would say.

In her audio she talked about being attracted to the physical characteristics of women, their bodies; their voices. She reiterated that she was not sure at what level could she feel that attraction towards a trans woman. I completely got her.

"Can I have an audio from you too? If you want."

She sent a second audio while I was trying to gather the will to do it and overcome my intense feeling of being evaluated on something that, even after 8 years of hormones, I still feel insecure about.

In my audio I told her that I was down to meet her, but preferred to keep it completely platonic. I didn't want to put myself through feeling inspected or risking not being woman enough.

I rejected her proposal to meet this evening with the excuse that I had already made it home and didn't want to go out the snow again. I proposed instead meeting during the weekend or next week. She said her weekend was busy, but next week we could see.

I didn't push it further. I am even less convinced than with Eva that I will hear from her again.

The complete conversation with Sy has been in French. It also started on Tuesday. It started fairly uneventful until she took a subtle turn after I asked her what plans awaited for her after work.

"Repos hihi, Live je me questionne quant au fait de m'amuser un peu avec moi-même."

We didn't exchanged much texts during my French course. After it ended, I tried to pick it back up, leaving subtlety behind.

"Alors, tu as-tu trouvé l'envie de t'amuser ou pas ce soir ? Après ce long jour, je suis moi-même tenté de voler ton idée."

I didn't hear back from her until this evening, when she came back to tell me that she, in fact, had had some fun. I asked her if she does it always by herself. Sometimes with someone, sometimes remotely.

After Gabrielle, I wanted to disclose it to someone whom I didn't care as much before someone with whom I did, like Marie-Anne.

"T'es-tu déjà amusée ave une personne trans ?"

"C'est arrivé. J'en déduit que la question a un but précis."

Later, when I spelled it out, she said it did not change a thing for her.

That is not true. I told Marie-Anne first.

"This might come out of nowhere, but I am trans. I know it's not apparent from the pics—I love and hate that—I just wanted to let you know now, sooner than later."

"I don't mind ! Tu es toujours aussi charmante." She took it in a much better way than I would have expected.

Saturday, April 6th, 2024 ===
"So then do you have plans for your week beginning?"

"Not really."

"Do you want some?"

I gave myself a shot today.

It's been three years since I gave myself the last shot. I was probably still living on Berri Street, on that small studio by the metro station.

Two weeks ago when I filled my prescription for hormones, instead of giving me 60 small blue estrogen pills, they must have given me 30. Right now there's only around 13 left in the bottle despite there still being almost three weeks until the time to refill the prescription again.

Yesterday, I went to the lab. We had a meeting with Boris to talk about his high-resolution data. I was the first to arrive in the office. That morning I did not stop at the bakery, since I would meet with Alda for lunch.

I went to Louis' office around 10h to confirm that the meeting was at 10h30. He said yes and that he was working on the HVR manuscript. Neda arrived not much later.

The meeting went fine. I could write about my feelings of insecurity, how I felt that I could have entirely missed that meeting and it would have gone exactly the same, how I contributed nothing to the conversation. But I won't.

Raúl was there. He was late to the meeting. He started as a post-doc at Boris' lab after finishing his PhD back in Querétaro. Once, while Aliza and I met him at Thomson House, he was drunkenly telling us that Boris had offered him a job as a research fellow. Data architect.

The day before I had my appointment with Dr Franck. I had it in the hallway outside the Viper Pit. I had checked to see if the videocalls cabin was available. It was not. At 10h30 exactly I opened the Teams app on my phone and saw that I had a missed call from Dr Franck. I redial it and he picked it up. It lasted the usual 5 minutes.

He renewed my prescription for another month. I will go back to taking the 40 miligrams at night, hoping that the sleeping pills will alleviate the insomnia. I suspect that the anguish I feel after taking them can be lowered by taking them just after a larger meal. His prescription was still for two 20 mg pills, so I can go back to splitting them if it doesn't work.

Not much after the meeting ended I left the lab. I asked Neda about why there were so few subjects in the dataset she gave me. It turns out most of the 800 timepoints were filtered out because they were not Amyloid positive. She explained how she had problems fitting the model with all subjects, but she reran her script for me with the full dataset anyway. It converged.

I took the 24 bus and met Alda at café Aunja a couple of streets below from where we used to share an apartment. I had considered eating there, but in the end I just ordered ginger tea.

I got an e-mail from Louis that he had finished with the HVR manuscript. After just some small changes, it was ready for submission.

I showed Alda the conversation with Gabrielle. She agreed that her first instinct was to overexplain her own thoughts. I shared with her Aliza's comments about her not intending to be mean, and how I did not blame her for the awkwardness of it all. When we got to her asking me to send her a voice message she said that action was, indeed, kind of mean.

We sat there, on a table by the window, talking and having our drinks.

Instead of ordering a sandwich we came up with the plan of going to Osmo X Marusan and eat there.

We took the 24 bus, but this time in the opposite direction. She paid for her fare with two loonies.

When we got to the place, we realized that all of the tables were full. I just used their toilettes and we left again.

I realized we were not too far from Arepera, so we ate there.

I considered ordering a beer with my food, but for drinks it was better going to Bifteck. I could not convince Alda, so we just had our meals.

We walked to the metro station. She put some tickets on her metro card and I went to the platforms to take the metro. There was a train standing there with its doors open. I hurried to get in.

The service was stopped in order to grab something that had fallen on the rails. The wait was not very long.

The day before, not much later of Dr Franck's call, I got a call from the pharmacy notifying me that they had gotten the prescription. After what I understood was her asking me if I wanted to pick up the medication, I asnwered that I could pass for it the next day. She said that she would have them ready.

I passed to the pharmacy after getting off at station Jarry. I walked to the counter and told the lady I was there to pick up a prescription for Sofia Fernandez. She went to check and did not find it. She asked me for my phone number to look into the system. A second woman came and asked me when had I called to pick up the prescription. I repeated that they had called me the day before to inform me they had gotten my prescription and I told them that I could come pick it up today. She apologized. I went back to sit down and wait.

After around 15-20 minutes, they first woman called me by my last names. I saw two plastic prescription bottles instead of the original ones like last month. I thought they were going to give me the hormones and started to get anxious about having to explain that I was there for the new prescription that had just arrived.

Instead, a third woman asked me if I had no insurance. I answered that I did have insurance, Croix Blueu. I hesitated at first after thinking I had mixed up the order of the words, but I said it correctly. She confirmed that it was normal then that I would pay for the total amount of 200 CAD. I said it was.

"C'est cinque semaines.," she asked in a statement rather than a question.

I didn't understand what she meant and my face let her know.

"C'est juste pour cinque semaines," she said again without adding any more context. "Cinque semaines," she repeated slowly once more thinking that my confusion was due to the language.

I looked at the bottles again and remembered that my next meeting with Dr Franck was in a month. The two pieces of the puzzle fitted right together.

"Oh, oui, c'est correct," I finally said.

I paid, denied needing a bag, and left.

In the afternoon I started to feel like shit given that I realized that I would certainly not be able to go back again and letting them know that they had given me half of my prescription. The first excuse my brain goes to is the language. But even in English, I wouldn't dare to do it.

I feel frustrated. I feel like an idiot. I feel like a piece of shit and I hate myself.

I have a week's worth of hormones that should last me three.

I considered halving the dosage, taking only one of the two daily pills. I would still need to go a week without estrogen anyway.

I remembered how a couple of weeks ago, when I checked the old medications, I saw the expiration of the injectable estrogen was not until 2025. Back in Mexico I would give myself shots every two weeks—or was it three?

I will need to see Dr Perera soon. Probably in May. I decided to give myself the shot today and pick up the pills in two weeks. That will give myself enough time to readjust to the normal levels of the usual dosage by the time that I schedule the bloodwork in a month.

I miss giving myself shots. There is this strange feeling in my thigh right now that somehow feels nostalgic.

What did I do last night?

I think I went to bed early. I did not have any meaningful conversations in the apps. No new promising people.

I asked Marie-Anne about her chaotic schedule. I had thought about asking her if she had plans for the weekend, but I wasn't sure she even got the weekends off. When she said she has Sundays and Mondays free, I instead asked her what was it that she was looking for in the apps. She gave me a vague answer following her sharing she had just gotten out of a long toxic relationship.

This morning I asked her out. We're meeting tomorrow at the café that I passed and promised myself I would look up online the day that I wandered in Parc Jarry.

### Sunday, April 7th, 2024
"Hi ! I really had a lovely afternoon with you. We can do this again after my trip, if you want."

We agreed to meet at Oui mais non at 14h.

I went to bed pretty early and, despite waking up with the sun, I did not get out of bed until my alarm at 11h.

The snow has now mostly melted. I wore the red top with white lacing on the sleeves over a blue pair of jeans. The weather was warm enough not to wear my red coat. I did not feel as attractive or as confident as I would like for a first date.

I broke the last wine glass that I bought from Amazon. My hand slipped taking down my water bottle to the edge of the glass. I lost more than half of my night drink.

I left 15 minutes before 13h. Part of me wanted to arrive after her, leave the stress of finding where to sit to someone else. When did I start worrying about finding an available table at bars and cafés?

I was around the metro station when I read her text in Tinder telling me that she'd be a couple minutes late.

I passed the bakery and the pharmacy. I walked the rest of the streets listening to my iPod.

When I gave her the option, Marie-Anne said that the café was from the same owner as La graine brûlée.

I got inside and walked to the bar. I ordered myself a large latte. While the bariste prepared it, I glanced around for empty seats. There were two big communal tables with available seats, but nothing contiguous. All of the stools were available at the bar. I saw there was a small table for two available next to a girl working on her laptop. I hesitated taking it given the closeness to the table to its left.

When I got my glass of coffee, I walked towards that table and sat down.

Not long after I sat down, the girl's companion came back to the table on my left and sat down.

Around 5 minutes later of being on my phone making use of the Wi-Fi, Marie-Anne came through the door. She turned around and recognized me. She came to the table and I stood up to hug her.

We sat down and started our date in English. Most of the rest of the tables were seating people working on their laptops, deep in their work. All of the conversations in our surrounding were in French. I felt like our English was louder. I couldn't help feeling as if it were an intruder, as if it was not welcome.

I told her that we could switch to English whenever she wanted. Whenever she couldn't find the words, she could say the phrase in French. Only rarely would she take my offer. Was this how Alexia felt when I spoke in French because she didn't want to speak English?

Once, in the second or third phrase in French she let out, I responded to her in French to ease her mind a little. Later she commented that my French sounded good. When the date was close to end and she mentioned the parks by her neighborhood in Anjou, I thought about offering going next somewhere close to her, maybe next time we could do it in French. I swallowed the thought and just waited for the light to cross the street to turn green.

We stayed in the café for around an hour. Before answering her last question, I interrupted myself to offer her if she wanted to walk around a little bit. We put our jackets back on and left. I guided us to turn left towards Parc Jarry.

We walked in there and my arm would sometimes brush hers. We walked to the fountain and we sat in one of the benches to enjoy the sun and the view.

We talked for the rest of our date. I don't think I ever felt self-conscious about the silences.

A small girl in a bycicle approached us and wanted to ask us something.

"Are you from the United States?"

She looked at her and replied in French that she was actually Québécoise.

The girl kept looking at her while she replied that she meant me.

Her mom, sitting on the bench to my right, started explaining that it was because of my accent. I told both of them that I was actually mexican. She wondered then if all Mexicans sound like me. I explained that I grew up by the border at the same time that I thought about all the people in Tijuana who don't speak English.

She asked me for the time and my watch said 17h05. She had some stuff to do at her house. I offered to walk her to the metro station and explained that it was on my way.

When we got to the door we hugged again and she offered to follow each other on Instagram.

She's going for three weeks to guadeloupe. We'll probably see each other after she returns.

"Sofía, you are woman enough."

I had my dinner and completely forgot about the pills. have been noticing that the side effects are stronger when I take the pills at the beginning of dinner, compared to right after finishing the meal. I guess this can be another experiment to see how long can I wait after eating the food without having the stronger anguish and tiredness.

Last night, after taking the 40 milligrams, I slept and woke up at 4h. This time, unlike those when I first started taking the sleeping pills, it was not as easy to get back to sleep.

Eventually I did.

I got up at around 8h. My appointment with Calli was at 10h30. I showered and put on my contacts. The plan was to see the eclipse with Alda. Last week I got us two pairs of glasses, she picked them up a couple of days ago. I put on a gray t-shirt with my blue jeans.

I brewed coffee and passed by the bakery on my way to McGill. The 144 bus left me up the hill at Peel, but even walking down to Dr Penfield, I had enough time to had my croissant and coffee before my session.

There was a guy who received my information before my appointment. He asked me if I had seen a counselor in person as he was not aware that after 3 years, this would be the last time that I would.

I met Calli. I did not tell her about finding a new therapist right away. I talked about waking up in the morning and about my appointment with Dr Franck. I don't remember if I talked about Sophie before. Probably not.

I can't remember how was the subject brought up. It was probably about my choice of taking the antipsychotics again after suspending them. She had asked me if I thought they were worthy. I replied truthfully that I did not believe it. Still, I actively chose to take them again.

And just like that, after deciding of taking care of my mental health, I had found another therapist with whom I could have more frequent sessions.

I had been afraid that the last session would then turn into a session completely dedicated to closure and talk about how I've changed.

It was not like that.

I talked about how things ended with Sophie. That last message and my active choice of not letting myself think that it didn't mean anything other than a definite end. That was the reason that Aliza told me to drop the don't lose my number line—even though it would have meant absolutely nothing, since the message, to this day, remains unopened.

When I talked about the differences between this fixation and the one from two years ago, Calli asked me what else could I have done differently. What have I learned from this. Where I set boundaries, what would they be.

I talked then about my rule of disclosing my gender situation bfeore the first meeting. The decision to not let what happened with Sophie—who after three days and four months, might have never surely known—happen again. I told her about the different reactions in this new round of people whom I've encountered in the apps. I didn't mention Jay's opennes and sincere curiosity. I mentioned the ghosting of the second hook-up proposal. Mostly, I talked about Gabrielle, her panic-induced rambling, her subtle and indirect inquiries, and her request to hear my voice.

I told Calli how I felt. I told her that after thinking it, and even though I proposed meeting completely platonically, I have decided that the best is that our meeting never happens.

"I don't wanna put myself through having to prove that I am woman enough for anybody."

We talked then about these past years, and how she has noticed changes.

She broke up or closing remarks for a final intervention that brought me to tears.

"When you say how I am enough, the first thought that crosses my mind is I know. But, honestly..."

"You don't fully believe it."

"No."

For the first time in three years, I got out of Calli's office without saying I will see you soon.

I texted Alda and we set to meet at the dépanneur by my old building. I walked the way that I hadn't walked back in a long time. It was much shorter than I had estimated. I waited for Alda at the parking lot of the store. I saw her traversing the dog park. We had plenty of time.

She bought a bottle a water, a can of white claw and snicker's bar. Myself, I got a can of cider, a bottle of ginger kombucha and a sour cream, onion and herbs Miss Vickies' bag of chips.

We climbed the mountain and did the mini-hike towards Lac aux castors. First, we went to the café des amis. I got myself a hot-dog. I had been craving one. It was expensive and it took a really long time to get it. There were a couple of families ahead of me in line who had ordered a bunch of food. That not being enough, my hot-dog stayed there, ignored, for around 5 minutes, before they finally announced it.

"I probably would have asked someone to get it for me," told me Alda.

It was cold, and definitely not worth the almost 8 dollars after taxes and tip. I did enjoy it, though.

I made a quick stop at the restrooms. We headed outside.

We found a spot around the lake, where we sat on Alda's scarf as a made-up blanket. We kept track of the time until the start of the eclipse. Alda had her camcorder with her. We would take some short clips of each other and the people surrounding us.

When we got to the park, it seemed kind of empty. Alda was convinced that it would fill up closer to 15h, when the eclipse would have started.

Marie-Anne told me yesterday how the news coverage would be at Jean-dreapeu.

When I was at Alda's, waiting for her to roll an extra joint, I was sitting on the couch in their living room. José was doing something in the kitchen. We had some small talk. He asked us if we were going to see the eclipse and where. Himself, he might look at it around McGill, since he had to be at his lab. I told him that we had considered going to Jean-Dreapeau, but decided it against it in the end.

I was sitting on the damp scarf when I saw a TikTok of the huge crowd agglomerating at station Berri-UQAM. It looked like a metro station in Mexico City.

We saw the eclipse. We counted the minutes and glanced up the sky with every 10% increase until there were clapping and cheers when the time came to take our glasses off. Everything around us became dark and colder.

Last week, I couldn't have cared less about the eclipse. I saw Vlad and Neda pick up their glasses and just decided to order ours from Amazon as an afterthought.

How wrong I was.

How many important experiences in my life have I missed because I did not give them the importance they deserved?

I texted with—how is it that I can't even remember her name?

I have been texting with Paty. I flirt both with her and with the idea of going to Mexico City this summer.

My mom texted me this afternoon, too. She wanted to let me know that she had talked with surgeon and they recommend extracting the wisdom teeth in two separate sessions with a week of recovery after each of them.

I thought about the message a couple of days ago from Raquel, telling me about La marcha lencha. I dismissed the idea telling her that it was a bit far from me.

But, what if?

What if, instead of travelling to San Diego, I went a week before July to Mexico City. I checked the flights and they were around 250 USD, one way, direct. I could stay at Sonny's, hang out with Paty, maybe even go to their parade. I could travel to Tijuana, maybe even with the rest of the girls if they chose to go the vinyards in the beginning of the month. Were that the case, I'd had the rest of July to have the surgeries and to recover before flying up north to Philadelphia and then to Montréal after the conference.

I haven't bought anything. I just proposed the idea to the group chat of the trip, and shared it with Paty and even Raquel.

I am starting to feel the side effects of the pills. It's not as strong, but it's still there.

I could have something else to eat right now. Maybe that could help, but probably not. I am just hungry.

I have been hungry a lot.

I had the croissant, the hot-dog and the bag of chips, the burrito. I have been eating more than usual. I should remember telling Dr Franck about my worries about gaining w

"Couches are more comfortable than the grass, but the thrill of being in hte open makes it more exciting, I guess. Now I am conflicted.

"Where would you prefer we make out?"

After having side effects by the end of the words—which even though I finished 1500, the website didn't let me make up for one of the missing days—I woke up at 3h and struggled to get back to sleep.

I had therapy with Fabiola today, thus I could postpone the alarm and stay most of the morning in bed.

I was confused at first at what time was my session with her. The event in my calendar marked 12h, but one of the earlier messages in our conversation was her confirmation for our session at 11h—I checked and there's a 2h time difference between here and Mexico City.

I brewed and had my coffee in the hour I had free after getting out bed and the start of the session.

In the morning, while I was still in bed, I got two new messages in Tinder. One was from Marie following up on my comment and response to her Fuck, Marry, Kill game of three date ideas. The other was a response from Marine, the French woman who is on Québec on a work permit and is currently in a town 70 km away from Montréal.

I responded to both of them but only the conversation with Marie kept going. We talked about our potential date either at a park or at one of our apartments. She proposed doing both, starting in the park and moving on to one of our places. Unfortunately, there is gonna rain the rest of the week.

"Let's stick to making out on a couch until the sun comes out again then."

We continued the banter talking about the show or movie that we would not watch. She proposed a scary movie that would give us the excuse to get close to each other for comfort. At the same time she asked me what was the stuff that I usually watched and I answered her about my taste for silly comedies, depressing dramas or mysterious thrillers.

I had my session with Fabiola. I spoke about how I couldn't sleep very well and my troubles with the medication. One of my homeworks was just about the stuff that I could be grateful about my body.

I briefly mentioned that my situation with Sophie ended, but after talking about it at depth yesterday, I didn't feel the need to do it again today.

I did not talk about what happened with my pharmacy and the need to inject myself with old estrogen.

She suggested that my sleeping issues might be due to anxiety and wondered if there was anything on my mind lately. I mentioned the committee meeting and my trip to get my wisdom teeth out.

I was the one who brought up the homework, how I really tried to do it, but fell shortly. Neither Aliza nor Sonny got back to me with the responses to my inquiry. I don't remember if I got to ask Alda.

I cried during the end of the session, but I don't recall the reason behind it.

A silly comedy was another option we could use, she Marie had said while I was in session. I added that it shouldn't be too funny otherwise we would get distracted from getting distracted.

"Absolutely, we got to keep our priorities straight. Since we ourselves are not."

"Talking about what we aren't, unless we get to third base it wouldn't make much of a difference, but I'm trans FYI—no need to get awkward if it's a dealbreaker."

Much quicker than I had expected, she replied. Much quicker as well, did I gather the courage to open up and see what she had to say.

"It's absolutely not a deal breaker, don't worry bb. Thank you for sharing that part of you with me, I appreciate it."

I thanked her.

We continued the conversation.

"As much as I would love to not watch a comedy, I really liked the idea of picking something scary. That being said, making out to the sound of people getting murdered might be pretty uncomfortable or hot as fuck, no middle ground."

We continued talking logistics and trying to figure out which of our places should we go to. Neither of us have roommates. Both of us are pretty close to a metro station. She has a cat but I am not allergic to them.

"I know! the hostess does NOT have to pick what we put on."

She loved my idea and decided to host.

That was her last message.


### Wednesday, April 10th, 2024
 "Je veux expérimenter un pue de cette énergie dom. Je veux que tu m'utilises."

I got distracted and now I don't know if I took my medicines or not.

I can't remember if I woke up early at night. I feel like I did, but it must not have been hard to get back to sleep since I can't remember. I stayed in bed even after the first alarm pushing it until 10h30. I got out of bed much earlier than that.

I had a message from Sy, the québécoise version of the catfisher. Last night I double-texted her after my vacuous message asking her about the eclipse to tell her that I wanted to have fun with her. This morning she asked me how did I want to have fun.

"Alors viens sur ig."

I did not have to go to the lab today, but I did anyway. The alarm that I had put still in bed for 10h30 started blaring when I was heading out the building.

Walking on Aylmer street from the bus stop, I passed by a communauto car with shit on the door handle and a soiled sock on the ground. I did not know what I had just seen until I viewed the related reddit post on r/Montreal while I was getting distracted in French class.

In the morning, the conversations with Marine and Maiya continued. One is someone who is not actually francophone who's just looking for friends and the other one is a French woman living in her car. With neither of them do I anticipate anything really happening.

Despite arriving almost at noon, I was the first person in the office. I send out another doodle poll to find an available time for my committee meeting. I finished the conference proceedings for the MJM. I started with the submission of the article to the Journal of Medical Image Analysis, but I realized I had to sign the cover letter and still correct some of the stuff in the manuscript—which would be better be done with my PC at home.

Returning from the restroom, I saw Daniel chatting with Reza. He was just getting the key to open the office. Not much later, Neda joined us.

After a bit of work, MohammedReza was also there. For a moment, even Louis stopped by the door to let us know he had just had his last class of the term. He also talked about visiting his aunt at the hospital who had just be been having delirium. She would talk about a big party being held at the hospital, an aunt or a cousin of Louis who had a fling with a Jamaican guy that resulted in a baby, or seeing rats in the ceiling.

When he left we continued talking. Throughout the day we talked about the HBHL funding opportunity for presenting work at a conference outside North America, substance-induced psychosis, open-world video games like GTA and Assassin's Creed, and body building.

Marie liked my text on which I agree to her terms of hosting, but added nothing.

"I'm pretty free this weekend." I broke the silence.

It wouldn't be until the middle of French class when she replied.

"Omg seeing you would've been so nice, but I'm completely booked for this weekend. Lemme get back to you when I'll know more about my schedule for next week." She ended her text with an emoji throwing a kiss.

I left the office around 16h30. Sy sent me on ig a packet of pictures, most of them of her at the gym with one of her face thrown in. She seems very attractive with a really nice body. I would love to hook up with her, but if she stopped replying, I would feel nothing other than mild disappointment.

She invited me to send her some. Earlier in the day I redownloaded snapchat to get some of the old videos and pictures that I got in there from my sexting phase two years ago. That led me to look at old pictures of me and how my body used to look.

I miss it.

I miss being OK with it and feeling attractive.

In the end I told her that some of my pictures were older, or I could take some tonight. Despite she telling me that she'd wait, I sent her a handful from the last two years where my body was not extremely different.

She called me gorgeous, but I didn't believe her.

Jay also reached out on my way home. I waited until Marie confirmed we would not see each other this week to reply. We're meeting Friday after work at Café Parvis. While we talked a bit about it, it is still unclear if there's a possibility that we will return to my home afterwards.

### Friday, April 12th, 2024
"I'm not an alcoholic. I'm not an alcoholic, right? Right? Do I have an alcohol problem?"

I've been drinking every day of the week. Maybe even last week, too.

I just came from my my coffee date with Jay and the first thing I did after peeing was mixing three fingers of vodka and the rest of the grapefruit beveradge that I bought at the dépanneur the other day.

I have been waking up at 3h since I've been taking the 40 mg at night. Yesterday, I couldn't get out of bed when I saw Louis' e-mail that he was going to work from home and all the meetings of the day would be moved to Teams. I went back to bed and continued sleeping.

The only thing that I have been working on is submitting the manuscript that is already ready for submission. It's the weekend now that Friday is over and the task remains undone.

I did not go to the office—either yesterday nor today, despite I was supposed to go both days.

I met with Louis at our usual time. I posed him the question about using all of the data or only those who were deemed Amyloid positive. I confirmed his blessing about me staying 5 weeks in Mexico during the summer. Today I bought half of the plane tickets.

I am sitting now with the computer on my lap and Community playing on the television. It's the episode on which Jack Black appears. I have only taken a couple of sicks of my drink, yet I am already feeling better. I definitely have to mention my drinking to Fabiola next session.

When I proposed going to Church pub I had given 18h as a potential meeting time. Aliza confirmed that morning that she would not go climbing, but she agreed with Alda that 18h was way too early. We agreed to meet at 19h30.

After my meeting with Louis I tricked myself into thinking that I was working.

Alda texted me and I asked her if she wanted to meet earlier. She was just about to take a shower, but maybe we could be there at 19h. That's what we ended up doing.

I asked her to act surprised whenever Aliza would tell her that she had broken up with Ali.

We didn't know it, but we were on the same metro. When I asked her for updates telling her that I was in Charlevoix, she replied that so was she. I told her to get off at the Wellington exit, but she was further back in the train. I finally saw her crossing the street at wellington and met her by the metro supermarket.

I keep glancing at the phone waiting for a number one above the tinder icon signaling the "you're a nice person, but I didn't feel a connection" text. I purposefully had the intention of not grabbing the phone—either looking for the cursed one or to order myself dinner—until I finished this 1500 words journal entry.

My thoughts keep flying inside my head, shapeless and lacking words.

I am hungry. I want to eat something. This morning I did not split the meds into breakfast and dinner.

Yesterday I did. I had breakfast before my meeting with Louis. I made eggs with ham and fried the last hashbrown patty.

Alda and I got a table in the middle of the pub and started with our 6 CAD cocktails that we expected to be 5 CAD. We had finished our first one and the waitress had just brought us the second one when Aliza poked me on the head, startling me.

She sat with us saying her greetings. She asked us to move to our usual table which had just been vacated.

Aliza told Alda about her breakup as context to her sharing with us about ending any type of relationship with her friend who happens to be her ex, Daniela. A couple of days ago she half-told me about it. I could relate after ending my own relationship with my friend who happens to be my ex.

"Tuve mi no-hookup date y me siento super shitty; en vez de hacerme pensar que no debería tener hookups solo me hace no querer tener dates. I feel unnatractive and disgusting. Unwanted. I wanna cry—no por la cita, pero por la frustración de cómo me siento."

In the end of the night we had 4 cocktails. The waitress came to tell us that the happy hour was coming to an end. We were not interested in getting a 5th one. Alda didn't even finished her last one.

I was supposed to have it, but after my question I didn't.

I ordered myself the chicken burger. This time I waited until finish the whole thing and the fries before having my second dose. I don't think I felt any of the side effects. If I did, I don't remember.

We said our good-byes. This was the first time that Alda and Aliza saw each other since she went to her cruise. Now she will go to Mexico on April 24th for her friend's weeding. I offhandedly mentioned that they would probably not see each other until after she comes back. On our way back to the metro, Alda asked me if I was seeing Aliza soon. I told her no.

I was walking home when I got a notification from tinder. It was Jay telling me that she was exhausted and wanted for today to be a coffee date only, if that was okay. She assured me that she would have more free days next week if something were to happen.

That night, I made a reservation for us at 18h45.

Despite splitting the dosage, I still woke up at 3h36. I might have forgotten to take my sleeping pill. I didn't fall back to sleep until around 6h or 7h.

Before I could sleep for good, I felt a tickling on my arms under the pillow. It was a long-legged spider that I threw away from the bed. I did not put my arms under the pillow for the rest of the morning.

I kept checking the mail for something from Louis, but nothing ever came.

I got up around noon and had coffee anyway. I made myself breakfast, a burrito of the grounded meat and rice with a fried egg thrown in. I enjoyed it, but, other than a couple of chips here and there, it's all the food that I've had all day.

I wanted to text Sy, but I don't wanna be texting her daily.

When I came back, I really felt like sending I feel really insecure right now, I want you to pin me down so I can't move and to take me.

Does the alcohol even help?

I finished with the preprint. During the weekend, besides doing the homework for French, I can actually finish with the article submission after updating the cover letter.

Before showering I had a videocall with Sonny. I bought the ticket from Montreal to Mexico City. Right now I just went to my email to confirm that there were no errors in the flight—that my name is spelt correctly, that the source and destination are right, and the date is not mistaken. Sonny bought my flight for a week later from the city to Tijuana on Aeromexico.

When I was with Alda and Aliza, I told them about my trip and how I had been talking with Paty, my crush from half a decade ago. Aliza read my conversation with her and made a notice of how she called me princess.

I showered and left the house with just enough time to get there at 18h45. Jay texted me on tinder while I was walking down Mistral under the rain. It was something about waiting inside. I told her about my reservation and then apologized because I could not type under the rain.

I ran to catch the train that was just arriving. I got in and the doors didn't close. I sat down and the doors remained open. Minutes kept passing and I worried that I was going to be late. They did close and I was not late.

I think the alcohol is, in fact, helping.

I could order myself some burgers from A&W already so they get her by the time I finish the remaining 100 words, but I am afraid of seeing that one.

The date wasn't even bad. I got to the café and asked for our table. It was by the window. Not even 5 minutes later, she arrived and I texted her that I saw her and to come inside. I waved her and she sat in front of me. She looked more attractive in person, which I think it's the opposite of my problem.

If the date started at 19h, it ended almost two hours later.

I told her about my insomnia. We talked about the US and americans. I compared it to Mexico City and how it made me more conscious of Mexico City's catcalling and insecurity and she talked about americans' stupidity and lack of insight. We talked about farming and her job as a CEGEP teacher. On the second half of the date we talked about tinder and the difference in dating today compared to a decade ago.

Despite being 2 hours in the café, the waiter never brought us a menu. I had asked her if it was fine that I had dinner. I am glad that I didn't.

I thought about asking her what her impression was of our date. For some reason I didn't.

She made an off-hand comment that she was enjoying the laughter and the back-and-forth. That doesn't necessarily mean anything.

I went to the restroom and she went after me. Not long after that she made a comment about whether they would bring us the bill or if we should ask for it. I don't remember exactly who asked for it—I think I did and she signaled to please bring us two.

Was she intending to emphasize that I shouldn't pay for her or that she was not gonna pay for me? Why does it all of sudden mean anything?

We walked together to the metro station and rode the green line until Berri-UQAM where we parted ways. She asked if we were gonna hug it out or shake hands. After I hugged her she wished me well and left, leaving me with the feeling that something else could have been said.

### Saturday, April 13th, 2024
 I think I will sip this one out.

-The Boys in the Band.

All day I have been waiting for messages.

I was supposed to go to the laundry and meet Veronica and Alda. I did neither of those things.

When I get drunk, I whisper the words as I type them down.

I was supposed to be a witness for Vero's wedding. She was going to marry her man as an attempt to stay in Canada after her work permit's expiry. The wedding was supposed to be on the second half of April. Last week—probably, I don't remember when it was—she texted us in our instagram group to let us know that the wedding was cancelled. She had broken up with him. He suddenly started asking her for 10k dollars—or was it 12k?—after hearing that people pay a lot of money for that sort of thing.

The plan came up of meeting. She proposed watching the Godzilla movie, meeting somewhere for dinner, or hanging up at someone's house for movie night and ordering food in.

Alda texted me in the morning to tell me her forehead was hurting. She fell on the stairs and also hurt her ankle. This morning that she went to take out the thrash realized that her leg was still hurting. She wanted to know if I would mind if she cancelled.

I wasn't feeling too well myself. I stayed in bed making up the sleep that I haven't gotten this past week. I was glad that there was an excuse for not getting out of the house today. Alda suggested that maybe I could use the distraction.

"Nah, I don't feel like 1-on-1 meetings."

I held up texting Sy yesterday, but I let it out this morning. I sent her a clip from two years ago of me arching my back with a hoodie fallen from my shoulders and a black opened tank top with my bra out.

"Je suis si chaude. I want you to pin me down and take me."

It's been more than 6 hours and the message—like Sophie's—remains unseen.

Jay's message hasn't come either.

Like in therapy, that sentence shut me down. I looked towards the movie of the party reminding me about the Narvarte shore nights at Ivan's house, and considered stopping writing.

I met Paty in one of those Yaaj's events. She spoke up in one saying that she had joined because she really liked Paola. Later, in a voice message, she would confess she liked me, too, but because of that other crush, never did anything with me before getting a girlfriend.

I double-texted her after my inquiry about her text while I was with Alda and Aliza at Church.

"Adivina quien ya tiene vuelo a CDMX."

That message, like the other ones, also remains unseen.

What else could I write about now?

I did not go to the laundry despite having the whole day at my disposal. I haven't even tried to read. Definitely, I did not work on the manuscript submission.

"Mon français fait encore défaut, mais pour ce que je peux t'offrir on a pas besoin de parler beaocoup."

Why did I text that to the latest meaningless match?

If I really want to hurt myself with rejection I could write to Jay, saying that I would wnat to see her again despite worrying that she does not feel the same way.

I have been putting into words the best response to her eventual text fully well knowing that the most probably outcome is a mutual silence.

I ordered myself two burgers from A&W last night. I have the tuna and the pasta and the rest of the ingredients ready to make a salad that will last me for at least a couple of days. I will probably order myself wings tonight to go with the two beers that are still on my fridge. Last night's excuse was the dinner I did not have during my uneventfull coffee date, today's can be the lack of ordering out at Vero's evening.

Eventually—other than in Jay's conversation I hope—I will get responses.

Right now I am texting with some other person on Tinder. Our conversation started with me confessing that I mistook his Tolkien quote for being from Pink Floyd. By the end of our conversation, I told her about my misunderstanding of Valerie's rescheduling for l'apèro.

"I read in your bio that you don't know what you're looking for yet. Do you have any vague ideas? Somewhere on the casual make-outs to the series of cute dates spectrum?"

Have you ever made out with a trans person? Do you want to?

### Monday, April 15th, 2024
"Je commençais a penser que tu m'avais oubliée."

I should stop letting myself not writing in the journal because nothing interested really happened.

I'm sitting on my desk waiting to be let in into French Class, writing on these words on the other half of the screen. Moments ago I thought about what I will reply when Éric indoubtably asks me about what I did during the weekend. J'étais déprimée cette fin de semaine-là, donc j'en ai presque rien fait. Je veux pas en parler.

The class has started and they're talking about their weekends. Now I am not sure I want to let everyone know that I have been feeling down. Even though I am well-aware some can read it from my face.

Saturday's plan with Vero and Alda was cancelled. Did I go somewhere?

When was it that I met Jay? No, that was the day before on Friday. I was supposed to go to the office, but didn't.

Saturday I ordered two burgers from A&W. I drank Vodka. Was it then when I almost finished the bottle that I had to get up in the middle of the night to drink water in order to ease the nausea?

No, that was Friday after the café with Jay. On Saturday I ordered the burger from KFC.

Yesterday I woke up tired. I saw Valerie's text apologizing and letting me know she would be exhausted after having to go downtown in the afternoon and would rather return home and crash at her house. I was glad to read her intend to cancel. I cheerfully accepted her raincheck and vaguely avoided her suggestion to offer a date for when to reschedule.

Having the full day at my disposal, I still haven't done laundry.

I think it was yesterday that I woke up to the match with Bea. She was another girl who stated in her bio was just looking for some fun. In her bio there was a quote from Virginia Woolf as well. She did in her own heart infinitely prefer boobies to clever men.

Our conversation flowed like the water on the side of the Mont-royal's paths. The responses wer brisk on both of our ends.

"You want fun. I like to think I am fun. We should be having some fun together."

After some exchanges, she offered to get a drink or something.

I accepted her invitation and took the opportunity to keep the streak of early disclosing.

"Before getting to the plans, I'm trans, in case that gets in the way of fun for you."

This time I did not get a quick response.

I started to get anxious. I started to feel unwanted and disgusting. It was an unfair feeling to have and I knew it.

I went to Sonny's conversation to talk about how I was feeling, but she wasn't available.

"No, that doesn't get in the way!" She replied around an hour after.

I asked her about her whereabouts and then replied with mine. We never settled on plans. She dropped off after I asked her if she was thinking about meeting that night or sometime during the week.

Last night, despite cooking a big bowl of tuna salad, I ordered food for the third time in a row. It was not a big meal, but rather some fries from Elio. I justified as it costing the 12 dollars that I would have spent on a beer with Valerie had our meeting taken place.

I think it was yesterday that I avoided drinking for the whole day.

I have been collecting matches and unfinished conversations. What is it that I am trying to fill?

I saw the profile of the couple that I had been texting last year, those people who have a cabin somewhere in Québec and a YouTube channel. I felt empty enough that I looked for them in my contacts and drafted a text for them sharing that I had just encountered them which left me wondering if they were around town.

Today was a day of getting responses. I just got a text from them moments ago. In the morning I woke up to a response from Bea. Moments later, after getting out of bed, I saw the new messages from Sy.

The couple told me they had just saw my own profile on the app, too—I had no match, so I imagine they rejected me this time; can't be too hurt about it, since I kept leading them on and put off meeting them last year. They added that they've been here all winter, but have been busy lately with a couple they met and are returning to their cabin this week.

"Bad timing, indeed," said my text in response.

Sy's text were uneventful. She acknowledged my texts saying she loved them, but didn't move the conversation forward. After I begged for more attention, she replied with just one-word negation and a two-character emoticon.

Bea asked me if I would be available tonight by any chance. I told her I get off at 21h, and asked her if that was too late for her. It was, she replied in the afternoon, and unfortunately she'll be busy the rest of the week.

"...but I could get together next week if you're down?" She offered like Marie, who has not reached back.

"Ngl, for a minute I was tempted to skip my French class tonight", I confessed. "Being completely open, the class really sucks."

"Can't tell you how flattering that is."

I just open the app now that I am on break, and I saw the new match from Maïck, the couple.

### Thursday, April 25th, 2024
"Sofía here, I made it home in one piece.

"...two pieces."

French has been insufferable.

I haven't been feeling well.
These past two weeks have been probably the lowest I've felt in months.

I haven't gone to the office a single day since Louis' departure.
I haven't gone out of the house too much.

I should had cut my nails yesterday, but didn't.
I don't know exactly why, but I feel a strong urge to pause this to do it.

Some time during last week I met with Chloé.
We went to Café Velours.
I got there first and waited for her with my latte on the lower floor.
When I got there it was empty except for a woman playing with her little girl.
After our date, I walked her back to the metro.
Like with Marie-Anne, we exchanged instagram accounts to stay in touch.
I haven't heard from her nor sent her anything myself.

I got a text from Bea half an hour after the midnight between Friday and Saturday.

"Hey, any chance you're free tomorrow or Sunday?"

The next day I was meeting Valerie at _Oui mais non_, but we could meet in the
evening.
Sunday was all free.

She told me that we would have to meet in her neighborhood in NDG, since she
was dogsitting.
We agreed to meet at Typhoon lounge at 18h30.

In the morning I got ready with the possibility in mind that I might head out
towards NDG directly after my coffee with Valerie.
I put on make up.
It was not evident that for the whole week before I had not been able to take
a shower, much less to leave the apartment.

Aliza texted me asking me how I was doing.
I did not lie.
I quoted an old meme and then, with another one, shared with her I was going
through a bit of a depression.
She told me she had plans with Liana and I was welcome to join them.
Later she would send me the details about them going for lunch at
_Les Brasseurs de Montréal_.

I was waiting for Valerie to return from the restroom when I saw the message
of Bea cancelling our plans for the evening.
The dog she was taking care of had just thrown up and she would need to stay
to take care of him.

"I promise I did want to see you,
he's just a very old dog and it's too much for today,"
she sent almost 20 minutes later while I was finishing with Valerie.

When I dropped Valerie off at the organic supermarket,
she told me to let her know if I wanted to go see Monkey man with her during
the week.
We said our good-byes.

During the rest of the walk home,
I replied to Bea to tell her I understood and to let me know if she wanted to
reschedule.
She thanked me for being so understanding and apologized again.

"Really, don't sweat it. Hope the ol' doggo is doing better."

I went to bed and woke up Sunday with the full weight of life pushing me down.
I hadn't gotten out of bed at 12h45 when I texted Aliza to let her know I was
not coming.
She understood and asked me if I needed anything.

Later in the day Alda made me remember that we had postponed our meeting with
Vero for the next weekend.
She wasn't feeling like going but was not comfortable with the idea of
cancelling again.
I told her I could do it this time.
I didn't have to lie.
I wrote that I was feeling a bit down and would love if we could meet another time.

Bea had texted me in the morning while I was still cuddling my depression.
Her text said that the dog seemed much better and it was just probably the
nerves of being abandoned in a new and strange place.
He was going home that afternoon so he would be OK.
She finished the message by saying she would love to reschedule.
She'd be available that same Sunday, Monday or Wednesday.

I don't remember if I was still in bed or if I had gotten up already when
I replied to her using Vero's cancelled plans as an excuse not to see her on
that dreaded Sunday, and, just like last time, saying that my French classes
would make it impossible to meet on her other available days.

"I do wanna reschedule, so don't think I'm bailing,
but it would have to be Thursday or later in the week."

We came back to the same _impasse_ we had been on the week before.
_Maybe next week?_

"Yeah, just don't be a stranger," I pled her.
"Who knows, I'll let you know if I feel like skipping one of the classes."

I didn't go outside. To this day I haven't done laundry.

I had my session with Fabiola on Tuesday.
It was the second session where I talked about my depression.
We tried to do a meditation exercise but I got frustrated when I couldn't
visualize anything she was asking me to.
She implored me to go outside some times,
to take walks and let myself be touched by the Sun.

After my session I met with Alda at Tabac,
the first place where I was supposed to meet with Valerie before she cancelled.

I had gotten frustrated the evening before with my French class when we were
instructed to do, again, the fucking activity about the text of Hubert Reeves.
It would have been the third time.
I spoke up about it and we moved to another one.
Still, the professor wanted to go back to it and correct it.

I decided right then and there that I was skipping Wednesday's class.

I texted Bea tuesday's afternoon, after coming back from Tabac,
before that day's class had started.
I asked her if she was still down to meet the next day.

"Sure! You skippin class?"

I shared with her my frustrations without going into much details.

"I'll try to say some things in French to you to make up for it."

"You're both pretty and smart."

We continued subtly flirting in the next round of texts where we settled on
the details.
I proposed going to the same place we were going to.
Did I pick it on purpose since I knew it would be close to her house?

Since we started talking, the conversation flowed with the implication that
we were going to hook up. _Want to get a drink or something?_

I did not get ready expecting to have sex that night.

I did put on the nicest bra I have, though.

I don't remember what I did in the morning.

Last minute, I decided not to put on make up.

I left with enough time to make two stops.
The first one was at Baristello, where I bought a bag of coffee beans.
Then, I passed the metro station and went to the pharmacy to pick up my
prescription for hormones and anti-androgens.

When I picked up the bottle of blue pills,
I looked throught the edge of the label trying to estimate the count of them.
It was less than I was expecting.
I opened the bottle and let out a fifth of its content on the palm of my hand.
I started to count until I changed my mind and put everything back inside.

I got to station Villa-Maria with plenty of time to spare.
I had two options.
I could get there first and find somewhere to sit.
Maybe I could order my beer and some fries and calm my nerves.
Instead, I decided to stay in a corner of the metro station killing the extra time.

The walk to the bar through Monkland was around 10 minutes.
Halfway there, I started turning back half-expecting to recognize someone.
I didn't.

I passed the entrance of the bar without realizing.
I walked back and hesitated before getting in.
I had no notifications in my phone.
I went inside expecting it to be full and having to find a table where
I could sit down and wait for her.

I was wrong.

The bar was almost empty.
I looked around and saw a couple of men sitting on the corner.
I saw the bartenders behind the empty bar.
Straight ahead, on the very end, was a woman sitting down on the couch
looking down to the table in front of her where her pint of cider was sitting.
I did not recognize her, yet I knew it was her.
I walked towards her.

Eventually she looked up and recognized me.

"You haven't been here long, have you?"

It had not been long, she said with her pint in front of her as
contradicting evidence.
She was just about to text me she was inside.

I told her I had left my house with plenty of time to spare and thus walked
really slowly coming there from the metro.

She had gotten before me on purpose,
since she wanted to sit down and relax herself to calm herself down.
I could relate, I told her, thinking about the time I went to N, two months ago.

I told her how, lately, I've been preferring being the second person to arrive.
For some reason I have been anxious about getting to a place and not finding
an available place.
It's selfish, but I've preferred to let that...

### Friday, April 26th, 2024
...We started our date by talking about our first date anxieties.

The day before, when I we were scheduling our date, I told her how,
since I was skipping responsabilities already,
I might as well use my morning to get some work done and actually going to the
office.

"Hahah look at you, professional queen!"
starts the last text in our tinder conversation,
where she tells me 18h is perfect since she had an editing job she needed to
finish.

I confessed that I did in fact not go the office.
I left out that I haven't done any actual work at all.

We talked about our jobs.
Myself going from psychology to working with addiction research in
my master's in Mexico City, and finally coming to work with Alzheimer's in
Montréal.
She asked me questions about the particularities of Alzheimer's disease
diagnosis and the role of the brain plaques in it.
She also asked me about memory and the hippocampus.
She told me about studying English in college, living in Halifax,
then Vancouver and Toronto before coming back to Montréal just last year.
Her work as a proofreader for a feminist publisher in Toronto.
She is now a freelancer editor.

When we talked about me skipping class after the latest frustrations,
she reminded me and showed me how she could introduce herself in Spanish.

"Me llamo Bea y bebo una pinta de sidra."

I was midway through my pint of guinnes,
when the waiter came and she ordered herself a second one.

The conversation flowed unlike many other dates.
We shared our experiences from Portugal and Spain.
We talked about aphantasia and my lack of internal monologue.
We talked about religion and the nausea triggered by the absence of
consciousness in my case and the vastness of the universe in hers.

The waiter came a third time and asked us if we wanted something else.
I broke her hesitation by saying I would if she did.
We both ordered one more.

Until the last minute our conversation never withered.

"I am going outside to smoke. Do you want to come with me?"

She put on her coat and placed one of the plastic menus on top of both of our glasses.
I grabbed my jacket and walked behind her towards the exit.

The sun had set already.
We had only the night as company.
It was colder than when I first had gotten in.
I put my hands inside my jacket pockets trying to keep the warmth in.
I tried, but failed to contain my shivering; she made no mention of it.

We continued talking between her puffs.

She put down her left hand holding her cigarette,
in a swift move she shifted the weight from her right leg to the left one,
and looked up to meet my eyes that were already on her.

"Can I kiss you?"

I walked towards her and placed one hand on her waist and the other one on her arm.
Her free hand went to my lower back.

We kissed.

We kissed a thousand times like no one were watching.
Here and then we would pause to smile and reposition our hands.
We didn't open our eyes nor wandered too far apart.
Her mouth tasted like tobacco and honey.
There was something in her that made me want to tell her all my secrets.

"I live 5 minutes away," she whispered without letting me go.
"Do you want to come home with me?"

She made a comment about littering and went to dispose her cigarette.
She grabbed my hand and walked me back inside to our table.

Our glasses were half-full.
She asked me if I wanted to stay and finished them.
Her promised-flavoured lips were still calling me.
Half of a pint seemed eternal.
I ordered the bills.

She went to the restroom and I paid for mine.
When she came back, I took my turn to relieve myself and she paid while I was away.

We put back our coats and this time she made a comment about how I was standing
the chill winds with just my spring denim jacket.

This time we did not hold hands while I walked behind her.

After the promised 5 minutes, we got to her apartment.
She let me in.

We took off our shoes.
We took off our jackets.
After her, I placed mine on the coat rack.

Did we start kissing again there or did she lead me to her bedroom?

She was the first to lie down on the bed.
I kneeled over her and continued our silent conversation.

After just a couple of minutes, I stopped.

"Hey, I am 90 percent sure I already told you. You do know I am trans, right?"

"Yeah," she smiled.
"Don't worry about it; I like girls."

It wasn't long before she prompted a second interruption.

"Do you have a condom? I don't."

I thought back to that evening and realized that the thought had never crossed my mind.

Two years ago when I came back from my holiday obsessed with the promises of Kate,
I had gone to the pharmacy and bought a box of condoms.
She had already left my life the night that I tested if I could put one on for
the first time since starting hormones.

"I don't. But... have you been with other trans people?...
It doesn't...",
my head went back to a couple of weeks after that first memory,
when I hooked up with Amanda and,
despite being able to hold an erection enough to put the condom one,
the erection was not enough to have penetration.

She affirmed she had been.
There was something in the way she responded that made me think how not only
was I not the first, but there had probably been several before me.

"It... it doesn't work like that anymore."
Had other girls' before?

We moved up from the bottom of the bed towards where her pillows were.

She grabbed the bottom edge of my blue top and pulled it up from my head.
I did the same thing leaving her in her teal bra.
She tried taking mine off but started struggling with the hooks.
I offered her some help with it.

"It's really pretty, but we don't need it right now."

We were both completely bare from the waist up when it happened.

We were repositioning ourselves in the middle of our kisses when her teeth
bumped into mine and I heard—or felt—a crack.
I instinctively pulled away and felt a tiny peeble between my lips.

"I think you broke my tooth."

She covered her face with her hands as if she were trying not to let
something out of her mouth.

I started laughing nervously while I remembered how almost 7 years ago I was
panicking in front of the mirror with the taste of blood in my swollen lips.
I knew exactly what had happened and I still felt the impulse to get out of
the bed in the search of a mirror.
I decided that the best idea was not to look at me.

She was mortified.
She kept asking me if I was OK.

"You know what, don't worry about it.
I can worry about this in the next couple of hours."

My calmness seemed to be contagious and we continued exploring our bodies.

"Do you like people sucking your dick?"

I hesitated.
I tried to hide the thoughts coming back to my mind when I told Jay that
I could tolerate it.
It's not that I don't like it, but I feel insecure about its smell and taste.
There's the inherent maleness of it that makes me think it would be disgusting.

Instead, I nodded.

She went down on me.
She pulled down my pants together with my underwear.
Her mouth was electric.
I bit my lower lip and felt the new sharpness of my front tooth.

I looked down over my breasts towards her head moving up and down.
I put my fingers inside her brown hair being careful not to push her.

I wanted her to finish and come back up to me.
I wanted to kiss her mouth hoping that I could lick my own taste from her
lips and give a rest to my worrying mind that it was not as disgusting as it
was in my head.

When she returned, instead of man, she tasted of acid and salt.
I continued kissing her desperately trying to make her mouth forget the taste
of my genitals.

I moved down through her body.
I first kissed her neck and she moaned softly,
a glimpse of desire barely escaping into the air.
I licked the space between her breasts.
I embraced her left nipple between my two lips and pushed down.
I tried to suck on it, but she jerked when I accidently grazed it with the
edge of my broken tooth.

I continued traversing with kisses all the way from her chest to her pubic hair.

Instead of getting to the destination,
I intentionally wandered on the edges of her vulva and the inside of her thighs.
I caught a glimpse of the tattoo in her leg,
which without my glassess it was just a blur.
Her breathing accelerated and I started hearing her whimpers.

I don't think I made her cum.
I went back to kiss her anyway.
On the way back up I saw her second tatoo in her arm.

We continued kissing, turning around naked over her sheets,
rubbing our thighs like twigs used to start a fire.

"I want to make you cum, Sofia", she whispered as her hand was jerking my dick.

I touched her, but her dryness made me think I was not doing a good job at it.
She might have sensed my worries, because she tried to ease my mind by letting me know she had some toys we could use.

She focused on me trying to make me orgasm.

I did not.

I artificially increased my breathing letting her think I had.
I thought proposing her to grab one of her toys and moving on to her,
but I swallowed the idea and just held her closer.

We stayed there in the arms of each other.
I asked her about the tattoo.

She described it to me, in detail.
She told me how it's a lighthouse in honour of Virginia Woolf's novel.
There is a phrase under the lighthouse talking about corridors that I
have unfortunately forgotten.
Uptop, there is the phrase _we remain_.

Her arm holds the silhouette of the islands from where her mother is.
She told me the initimate stories of the island.
She narrated the memories she has in there about exploring the fields with her
father and swimming in the lake with her friends.

I held her in my arms as her head was lying on top of my right breast.
As she was talking, I could feel her voice caressing my chest.
It was as if she were talking directly to my heart,
every whisper warm and affectionate.

She asked me about my pictures.

We talked about how I started, how it was a suggestion from my therapist.
I told her how I got into film photography.
How I feel uncomfortable by the invasiveness of street photography,
which is accentuated by the vulnerability I feel whenever someone sees me taking pictures.

"You should take me with you once."

I heard her well, but I still was convinced that I must had misunderstood her.

"That you should let me come with you once when you're taking pictures.
I would also love if you take a picture of me."

We then talked about her old roommate who had a made-up dark room inside a
closet and who had taken the single film picture she has of herself.

I told her how I would definitely love taking a picture of her.

I looked at my watch and, despite wanting nothing more than staying there with
her for the rest of the night, I told her that I should be leaving soon.

We talked about the night.
I confessed that I was not expecting it.
She let me know she had hidden some of her medications—despite then feeling
like she didn't have to—and made the bed.
I should be flattered, she said.

I told her, in the end, that I was glad that I was not going with the idea
that there was the possibility of coming back home with her,
since that would had made me more anxious.

She told me that I turned out to be cooler than she was expecting.

She went for water and, while she was away, I put on my underwear.

"So, was it worth it?" she joked about my tooth.

I laughed and said it was still too soon to joke about it.

The loose piece was on her night stand.
She teased me if I wanted to take it with me or leave it.
I said that she could keep it, and hold it next to the picture that I would take of her.

We started picking up our clothes and putting them on.
I thought about the poem of Cortazar, but made no mention of it.
She put on her pijamas and walked me outside the bedroom.

I complimented the artwork that was framed.
She made a comment about how all the art in her place is from people she knows.
Would she one day hang up the portrait that she asked me to take of her?

Did she mean it or was it just an empty promise you make when you're cuddling
without clothes and full of hormones?

I took my jacket from the hook.

"Please text me when you get home. I worry."

"Sure," I assured her. "Do you want to move outside the app?"

She looked at me and I saw doubts shinning from her grayish blue eyes.
She still took my phone and put her number in.

I walked towards the door after putting my shoes on.
She grabbed both of my hands and we kissed again as a way to close the night.

I closed the door behind me and walked alone towards the metro in the cold night.

Now, I'm sitting down in Café Velours.

This morning I made an appointment at the dentist.
My smile is no longer broken.

I'll grab my stuff and walk home to grab the bottle of sparkling wine that
I'll take to Vero's house.
### Saturday, April 27th, 2024
 Regardez-moi, ou du moins ce qu'il en reste.  Regardez-moi, avant que je me déteste.  Quoi vous dire, que les lèvres d'une autre ne vous diront pas ?   C'est peu de choses mais moi tout ce que j'ai, je le dépose là.   —Voilà, Barbara Pravi.

I finally did it.

After weeks, I was starting to think it would never come to this, but, it's done.

I did laundry today.

Yesterday was a long day.

For some reason I woke up very early with enough energy to get out of bed. I brewed my coffee and sat in the couch of my living room waiting for the dental clinic to start their working hours. The night before I had found a clinic with head dentist who had an hispanic-sounding name from the network of the PGSS dental insurance. The clinic was only a 10-minute walk away from home.

A couple minutes past 8h, I sent them a message on Whatsapp. In French, I made up an appointment for a consultation at 10h30. By the time I had finished my coffee and showered, they reached back to me asking if I'd be available to be there at 10h.

The dentist assistant came to me speaking Spanish and gave me the forms for medical history. I had not finished it by the time she invited me to join her to the examining room. She made some small talk while the dentist came. She was the one who took the radiography.

The dentist came and, after hearing us speaking Spanish, joined us. He told me they could fix the tooth with resin or with a crown. He made an off-hand comment how Green Shield insurance covers up to 600 CAD and the cost should fall under that.

I didn't need anesthesia, but there were some discomfort on the end. The process lasted around 30 minutes. When they let me go, the dentist made a comment about how I needed a cleaning since I had lots of plaque. I thought to myself how it's been less than six months since I had one, and then I realized that whenever I get depressed, the first signs that I am in the depths of it is foregoing showering and brushing my teeth.

While within the dentist's room we spoke in Spanish, outside the whole process of paying and figuring out how to work my insurance was done in French. After a couple of back-and-forths exchanging id numbers, accounts, and trying with both Green Shield and Desjardins insurance, the payment finally went through. From the 386 CAD total, I payed 173 CAD.

I walked to Café Velours, where I worked a bit and finished writing about two nights before.

In the early afternoon I went back to my place to pick up the bottle of sparkling wine that I promised to take to Vero's.

"Guess who got her tooth fixed this morning! Just to ease your ming in case you were worrying I was walking around with a broken smile."

I texted Alda confirming she was indeed going to show up. I started getting anxious about the idea of being with Vero by myself for the whole evening. She got back to me before I left the house to ease my mind, but warned me she'd be a couple of minutes late.

When she put it in the conversation of the three of us, Vero joined her by saying she also needed to get some stuff done and would be arriving closer to 19h30.

I took my time walking to the metro station, and even let one or two trains come and go without boarding them. I got out at the familiar station Vendôme, and took the 105 bus. Despite not arriving at the initially agreed 19h, I was still too early. I walked to Provigo and got myself two cans of beers and two small pies—one lemon and the second apple.

Walking towards Vero's, she saw me from the bus. We met on the street of her house and thus entered together. Alda arrived not much later.

The night was fun and pleasant. We drank wine and talked about broken teeth, ex-boyfriends, and PRs. We ordered a pizza and some wings. Vero told us all about the story of her two exes and different forms of betrayals. I was confused by her story—probably because of getting too drunk with wine having only eaten half a bag of chips, a cup of coffee and a small pichet of hibiscus tea—that, even if I wanted to, I could not be able to summarize Vero's story.

We were too late to catch the last metro and thus Alda and I shared an Uber to our respective homes. I started getting a bit dizzy inside the car, but it all went fine.

I chatted with Alda in French. We bonded over the fact that we were really drunk.

Alda invited me to go to this bar to stalk Anthony. She could pay for my first drink, and after a bit we could do our own thing. In the end it turned out that the event had passed already.

I confessed to her that I was thinking of Sophie again. I feel uncomfortable now whenever anyone, like Vero had done earlier in her text letting me know she had just seen me, calls me Sofie.

"I was thinking how, now that I was starting to feel limerence for a new person, it'd be the perfect time for her to come back. And then I started getting anxious about two people."

"I've been there. You don't want to be there."

I confessed to the both of us that I had been thinking about deleting Bea's number.

"I am well aware I haven't told you her name nor given her a nickname. That's on purpose."

I continued talking about Bea, and how I felt confused and frustrated.

"Even though I am hating where I am right now, I feel so much better after having sex. It's like a huge weight of my body and I can finally rest.

"I was just thinking that I don't even like sex that much. My whole thing with this girl is not even because of the sex, but because of the date and the moments after the sex.

"She ruined it be being too good for me."

"You met her once. You don't know if she's too good or you wanted her to be too good."

"I am not saying she's the one. I'm saying I enjoyed talking to her too much to have had sex with her. I shouldn't had, except that I did want to have sex. I wish I had had this fun with any of the other dozens of girls who I've gone out with without the intention of just hooking up.

"When we were on the date I was having much more fun than I've had any other date, almost like with Sophie. When she invited me to her place—and I realized it was a hook-up date after all—I felt let down."

"It seems that you had a connection and I think deep down you don't mean this. You had the best case scenario for a first date: you had fun and you had sex."

After that exchange it was when we switched languages before falling asleep.

I did not take my antipsychotics and thus I slept the whole night.

My watch started vibrating in the morning and I saw it was Sonny on Whatsapp. It continued vibrating several times, but I did not look again. One of those notifications was for Bea's response.

"Genuinely so happy to hear that."

In Bumble, Lili, the girl from Paris invited me out to get a drink. Instead of planning the date, I told her I was trans.

She confessed that she was not expecting that, but she was still down. She gave me her phone number. We did not make any concrete plans. I am not too fond of the idea of going out and have a date in French. I know I can do it—I have done it—, it's just I doubt that I will enjoy it at all.

About coming with me to take pictures, did you mean it?

### Sunday, April 28th, 2024
"Have you given any thought where you'd like to go for the pictures?"

I feel tired. I was starting to get out of the dark place. I might not be entirely better.

It was too late to get the birria ramen from La toxica. The chips were no longer available. I decided to order from KFC.

I had the food and took the nightly dose of medicine. Maybe it was because I skipped the last dose; last night it was one of the worst nights since I came back to 40 miligrams before bed. I went to bed shortly after finishing dinner at around 22h and woke up barely past midnight.

It was excruciating trying to get back to sleep. There was a thunderstorm. The lights kept creeping in through the open drapes, with a delayed muffled scream piercing the night.

I might have finally fallen back to sleep around when the sun came up.

Today, after finally doing laundry and having just enough food in the fridge, there was no reason to get out of bed.

I had my coffee and breakfast when I finally did. I didn't realized it until I started trying to eat, but I am starting to have flashes of pain on my right lower wisdom tooth. It's that same lightning that I would sometimes have when having cold beer. This morning it was everytime that I widened my jaw. The scream inside my gum was louder when I tried to chew.

It's a bit less than two months before I fly to Mexico and even there I won't get to Tijuana until exactly two months from now.

A couple of hours ago, I put on some sweatypants and a hoodie to walk to the dépanneur next door for a large bag of chips. I had to take a tylenol pill to be able to snack on them. The pain has subsided by now. I am just waiting before having the three pieces of fried chicken that are waiting in the fridge.

I am nervous about tomorrow. Louis will be back from his trip. We will have an interlab meeting and I actually still need to read the article that will be presented. I need to send an email to Danilo to remind him a second time about filling out the Doodle poll. I mostly worry about not being able to get out of bed.

I will try to go to the office most days of the week. I can use the distraction.

I will talk with Fabiola this Wednesday. I scheduled a meeting to get my blood drawn for the following Thursday. I'm hoping I will get an e-mail reminder to confirm my appointment with Dr Franck. I should force myself to tell him that I had one of the strongest depressive episodes in the recent past.

I texted Bea in the afternoon.

I kept drafting the potential text in my mind all morning, but there was something wrong with the idea. Whatever I thought about sending, there was something that wouldn't feel quite right.

I keep feeling anxious about going back to a similar situation to the one I experienced with Sophie.

Having sex with someone is the perfect circumstance for an unhealthy fixation to blossom.

I have a thought that scares me, a strong idea that is resistant to the factual evidence that contradicts it. I am afraid that she was strictly looking for a one night stand—despite her tinder preference stating short-term rather than nothing serious. Even if she was not looking for a one-time thing, sex with me might have been so off-putting, or at least uneventful enough, that she has no desire to see me again—except that she was the one who suggested me bringing her with me to take pictures, who unpromptedly confessed that she'd love the idea of having a picture of her taken by me; why would she say that if she didn't intend to see me again.

She was the one who asked to kiss me. She continued kissing me and only stopped to invite me home. She grabbed me by the hand to walk me back inside. She cuddled me and told me the intimate story about her tattoos, letting me catch a glimpse of her past. She made the comment about not needing to hide her meds from me. She suggested to join me in what I confessed was an intimate and personal thing for me. She asked me to text her when I get home. She replied to my text. She hasn't disappeared.

At least not yet.

### Tuesday, April 30th, 2024
 I guess when you're young you just believe there'll be many people you'll connect with. Later in life you realize it only happens a few times.

—Céline, Before Sunset.

I can't keep on with this.

Éric, the French professor is talking in the slowest voice possible explaining for a thousand time the conjugation of the imperative form. We're reviewing the exercise that we were doing last night on the end of the class, and a apparently almost nobody finished.

I am tiring of nodding or shaking my head in silence to the attempts of responses of my classmates—which are mostly wrong—just to entertain the façade that I am paying attention.

I want to shut off my camera and scream.

I have been feeling more irritable than usual. It's like my emotions have woken up from the numb state they were in the past few weeks.

And, of course, now that I was asked to participate I made a mistake. Instead of saying Non, ne me le dis pas, I said Non, ne me dis-le pas, to which the professor thought I had wrongly conjugated the imperative of the plural of the second person.

He made himself a mistake when he conjugated the three forms the imperative of the verb dire, as he wrote dit rather than dis.

I argued him in a way that I am not used to. If he was taken back, he did not show it.

I have to calm myself with the idea that nobody pays any attention to my camera view, as I certainly pay no attention to theirs.

When I met with Maria and her boyfriend at her bar, she recognized the fact that I can't seem to be able to hide my frustration from my face.

On my way home, I could not wait for the 144 and instead walked towards the metro station. I contained my urge to cry all the walk there and couldn't hold it anymore waiting for the train inside.  The train was just leaving by the time I got downstairs. I was sitting down on the bench by the end of the platform waiting for the next one. Despite not leaving with plenty of time, and having to walk towards the metro instead of taking the bus, I had enough time to feel my recently awoken emotions. I looked towards my left and saw the people conglomerating. I thought about the metro station and the direction I was in. It was just a couple of minutes shy before 17h. I felt embarrased that I unconsciously considered and discarded the idea that Sophie would be taking this train in a couple of minutes. I was not aware of my own train of thought until after arriving to the idea that she wouldn't be at the station until around the 15-minute walk from McGill. I saw the arrival of the consideration that, had her medical continued—or were real—she might not even be working at all. When I got to that point, I purposefully discarded the whole thing and wiped the tears that had been coming by their own free will.

When I got to the train, I was no longer crying.

I walked towards the corridor. There were people taking all of the seats, but I did not care about sitting down. I noticed that one of them was occupied by the shopping card of one of the man sitting behind id. He looked at me and gestured the removal of it offering the seat. I shook my head dismissing the offer.

I transfered lines and continued my effort of not crying anymore. I can't remember what kind of music was playing through my headphones. It was probably the defualt playlist of my Apple Music account.  The professor noted I was bored—he might have seen me when I nodded as he asked if anyone had finished the activity moments before sending us out to the breakout rooms—, and told me I could watch a video, one of those we were instructed to see when we reviewed the different genres of television and movies.

That time I had been instructed to watch a comedy series similar to The office, but not quite as funny nor entertaining. I picked the first episode of Les simones. I didn't have much hopes before going into it, but it was better than just browsing reddit. I kinda liked it.

I've been texting with Paty on Whatsapp.

I have been thinking about deleting the apps. After the class ended, I got a new match in Hinge. She replied with the latest book that made her cry, In defense of witches: the legacy of the witch hunts and why women are still on trial, and asked about mine. After a some quick exchanges in which I confessed I haven't been finishing the latest books I picked, asking me which movie had made me cried—which I was very tempted to watch again before starting French—, and asking if I spoke french. My last message went unreplied.

Maybe she was off-put by my grammatical errors in French meaning that I had vastly overestimated my fluency by putting French as one of my languages, despite the fact that she started the conversation by texting me in English.

Maybe she read my last messages lacking a direct question and she got bored with me.

Maybe she just got distracted or went to sleep.

I might hear back from her later just as well as she might have been just another person who deemed me undeserving of connection.

## May, 2024

### Wednesday, May 1st, 2024

 The sink is full of dirty dishes, but I've just given up.  My bed is my only sanctuary.  My mind is only temporarily.  Stuck on the picture of your face,  but I can't block out the memories.   I can still feel your skin.   Fuck you for makin' me this way.   —Fuck U, Frances Forever.

I was dreading the same old question about how I've been doing. How could I answer such a thing?

I've been doing better; I am no longer depressed, stuck in an endless pit of darkness and self pity, trapped in a black hole sucking my emotions and my energy and my will. Instead, I am now overflowing; I am on the edge of a breakdown; a water dam minutes before an inundation; I have sadness and rage battling each other at my throat, my eyes moist and tired, filled with tears of desperation that had found their way out from where they had been lost all this time.

I stayed in bed just until 30 minutes before my session at noon. I struggled to fall asleep last night despite being completely sure of taking the aiding pill as soon as I laid down under the sheets.

Was it last night or this morning when I browsed up Bea's profile and I made everything worse?

Looking for some fun, and if that fun turns into a lovely partnership that would be great too.

The other thing that happened, I am sure occured right before my session. My watch vibrated with the image of a new text. When I saw the name and the adjunct emoji, the first conscious thought that appeared in my mind was that it was not my mum's. Preconsciously I browsed through the different possibilities of people who could be texting me directly to my phone number until the person matched the playful image that I had attached to their name. I arrived to the one according to Kath and the abbacus.

I read her texts through the notifications breaking down on my notification page. The ideas in them are not important. I was mostly concerned with the act of coming out after weeks—or even months?—of silence, of the idea of getting a response from a text that preceded the one I sent Bea last Sunday and even the one that I sent Sophie a month ago, the former unresponded and the latter unopened.

I made no mention of this new event in therapy. Instead I talked about my recently awaken emotions, my crying on the metro station; my inability to present myself to the pharmacy and present my situation with my hormones; my frustration with not being able to know how to deal with people, with understanding them—the second half of the session was dedicated to my recent undeserved illusion with Bea and my misreading of her interest in seeing me again, leading to the disappointing confusion from my latest unattended text.

Fabiola shared with me the impression that hearing my narrations I reminded her of a little girl; someone scared and hidden, unable to handle the world's expectations on her or to understand the adult people in it; but also someone full of innocence and naïveté, easy to be enchanted and fooled by empty gestures or misleading promises.

I am sitting down sipping on warmed up hibiscus tisane and watching the people as they are slowly leaving and emptying up the café that was full when I arrived an hour ago.

I had to get out of the house, I had to escape the incoming wave that I invoke by my impulsive urge to go through old connections, one by one, discarding some and teasing the conversations in others.

"I feel like texting people," I started with Alda; "just had therapy—she told me to do the exact opposite, but whatever—I'm going through old tinder matches, deleting or texting to try to distract myself from texting the latest girl, or worse, Sophie."

"Haha, maybe you should take a break from the girls; thinking about them, texting them..."

"Right," I don't think she got the dismissive nature of my response, since she was unaware that I had thrown my phone to the pillow beside me and rubbed my temples in frustration— to Fabiola I had just shared how I was against telling people about my incident with the pharmacy because of a fair of not being understood.

She had had the same initial suggestion. Maybe it's time to put off trying to connect romantically with people. I retorted how I have been doing that—slyly leaving out that while I go through these cycles of stopping every now and then, this forced hiatuses never last long—and, it would just repeating that same pattern that happened two years ago; I was obsessed with someone for weeks, I dated compulsively for a while to the point of impulsively reaching out to a couple, finally meeting someone willing to have sex with me, misinterpreting their interest in seeing me again, and finally stopping seeing anyone for months after.

I picked up my phone again to share with her something that I had well forgotten.

"I didn't tell you; last week I was tempted to open Grindr. I could do that, move on to guys—chasers. That'd certainly make me feel something."

"Why did you decide against it?"

"Because I knew I was depressed and that I'd probably regret it." The thought of impulsivity and regret reminded me of my worry last night about having the mildest faintest forms of hypomania. "I don't remember if I told you, I texted the couple—the youtubers; they were busy, though.

"I know I told you, but I don't know if you got how I really felt like I needed sex

"Now it's not the sex; now it's just, I don't know, feeling something; it's not boredom, just numbness."

I closed my eyes and finally swallowed the realization that had been bothering me for a while.

"I'm upset—no, I'm mad with both Sophie and this other girl—not that I think they did anything morally wrong, but I am angry at them. That's why I want to text them; which I'm sure I'm going to regret."

I quoted the text where I mentioned Kath's chat's resurrection. "This pissed me off. This is what started everything."

I started with tinder. I deleted the conversations of the girl I suspected was trans and the Sophie that was visiting from the united kingdom. From memory, since I don't feel like turning over my phone, I remember teasing Cam that we could start planning the wedding—I had joked that after matching more than 6 times the only reasonable next step would be to get married—on our eventual next match. I asked the ukranian tattoo artist with whom I was talking about transition what would she change of her if she could change anything, either internally or externally. I texted the French woman living on the woods and sleeping in her van asking her if she had ever looked me up on messenger after asking me to move over ther, or have you been texting with another Sofia all this time? I saw the conversations with both Chloé and Marie-Anne, but in my head I moved them to the bottom of the list.

I moved on to hinge. Either last night or this morning, a girl who hadn't replied for a couple of days brought up the conversation from the archives where I had disposed of it. That was not the first one I replied to. I deleted some of them and left alone the two where I had already reached out. I went back to the French girl whom I invited to text me back, bringing up the fact that she hadn't done it, as if it was something worth of stating out loud; and later acknowledged that I hadn't done it either, as if this unasked insight and admittance of guilt made me somehow less worthy of embarrasment and uncomfortableness. I went to the conversation of the girl who freaked out the moment I mentioned my transness and shot her point-blank with the question if she had meant it when she said whe was okay with being friends betraying my own self-realization that I had no interest in ever pursuing a friendship with her. I teased the French girl whose question in French I had replied-to in English with a cheeky peut-être que j'aurais dû te repondre en français. I finally responded to yesterday's zombie recommendations of the sexuality book and the murderbot series by confessing that the former would be useless for me since it was probably written for bodies different to mine and later sharing that the latter, on the other hand, might be just exactly what I need since I seem to be unable to finish books given I keep starting books recommended by women I meet on dating apps; the irony of it completely flying over my head.

I opened instagram and texted Chloé, asking her about her night shifts; and Marie-Anne, mentioning her latest story and asking her if it meant she was back in Montréal. We exchanged a couple of texts until I the moment I stopped opening her notifications—again, the hipocrisy of it also flying over my head.

### Friday, May 3rd, 2024

"What would be the least pathethic double-text? Asking for a made-up friend.

"Nevermind, my made-up friend just died. RIP. God bless her."

Yesterday I woke up at 3h and couldn't fall back to sleep. I decided to start the day at around 6h. I made a stop at the bakery for an almond croissant and arrived to an empty office. I had my breakfast in silence before starting work.

I felt energetic and jumpy, a bit impulsive. It was hard to stay sitted and working.

Aliza texted me how she and Zacky were the only people in her lab who didn't get FRQS. The vibes were now uncomfortable. I would have hated the artificial guilt-driven niceness.

Before my arrival to the office, Louis sent an e-mail that he would work from home again. Later in the morning, he sent another one to reschedule our personal meetings since he would meet with his family doctor. I picked the earliest timeslot at 11h. I drafted an e-mail with the bulletpoints of what I wanted to talk about and attached the tables and figures that I have made these two weeks he was away.

I didn't do much before our meeting. A couple of minutes to spare, I went outside the office with my water bottle and headphones and sat on the attrium listening to music.

With Louis I talked about the lack of response from Danilo. He confirmed that he had a meeting at 14h, so we agreed that I would ask IPN about the possibility of him leaving early after giving his own feedback. The next day they confirmed that it can be done and I sent out the e-mail setting down the date. We also talked about my papers. He sent an e-mail to Mallar asking him to clarify his request of revision. He, too, replied today with the asked information. For my second paper, we agreed on a list of potential journals to which I can resubmit. I need to draft the cover letter for Brain, our first option, but I can get to that next week. After showing him my advances of results, and posed him my questions of how to move forward, we agreed that it was better to ask someone. We scheduled a meeting with Boris next Monday in the afternoon.

After our meeting, I left the booth and headed back to the office to pick my stuff. It was no longer empty. Daniel and Vlad were inside working. I put on my jacket and grabbed my bag. When I said good-bye, they didn't hear me.

I went towards Hochelage to meet with Alda at Atomic Café. She picked a place close to her French class that had just ended.

I walked to station McGill listening to music. My phone was silently screaming to me full with notifications from the conversations I had stirred the night before. It was burning me. I was tempted with the idea of throwing it in the metro tracks. Instead I double check the general whereabouts of my destionation, took off my headphones, and turned the phone off.

"Imma turn off my phone, if you wanna reach me use your telepathic powers." I texted Alda.

I rode the metro in silence until station Joliette. When I got out of the station I wasn't sure of which direction to walk in. Fortunately, I made the right choice and got to the café where Alda was already sitting inside with her americano.

I got myself a coffee despite having already drunk one in the morning. When we finished it she offered to buy me a beer if I went to the front to order them. We stayed in there long enough that she returned the favour. When we finally left we walked around the street looking for a thrift store she had seen. We did not find it.

I shared with her that I had the gut feeling that something important would happen before the end of the week and the anxiety that, wathever it would be, it would be disappointing.

When we rode the metro, two very drunk people got inside and made everybody uncomfortable. I was glad that I shortly left to change lines. Later, when I texted Alda about her getting home and she told me she had missed her station, she made no mention of them.

I replied to all the people who were awaiting for a response. I deleted more people.

This morning I decided I would not work.

My mum texted me and, like many other times, I worried she was going to tell me that Nymi had died. She sent me two pictures of her after I asked her if she was still alive. Later add that she has been kind of sad and they are taking her tomorrow to get her hair cut and to see the vet.

In the evening I read the journal entry of my night with Bea. I feel the urge to offer it to her as a bribe to see her again.

### Sunday, May 5th, 2024

 I want to see you again.

Marie-Anne texted me yesterday morning. She subtly nudged me to ask her out by asking me for my plans of the week-end. It was a mirror image of how I asked her out the last time. I replied to her by saying I didn't have any plans yet and used the same emoji she had used. I threw back the question at her. She responded that she had nothing planned for today and ended the sentence with the image of an eye.

"Look at that. We'll have to do something to fix that."

"Always here to save the day."

Yesterday started later than usual. I overstayed my now-forgotten dreams. I didn't get up until the skirts of noon. There was nothing much in my Saturday other than scheduling today's date.

I prepared breakfast before brewing my coffee. The day before I had bought a dozen eggs and a can of pringles from the dépanneur. I wanted to top my noodles and ground meat with one or two fried eggs. Despite having leftover meat, I ordered two burgers from KFC last night. This time I did leave the second one for today.

Yesterday I matched with a girl on Hinge. One of her profile queries talked about her worst date story, her response was a tooth was lost in the mix.

That same thing happened on my last date! And then she ghosted me.

She matched me around 20 minutes later asking me if it had been my tooth or hers.

I gave her the answer. I have no way of knowing if she read it or not.

Yesterday I did not go out. I did not shower. I tied my hair in a french braid in order to keep it out of my face.

Paty has gotten a response for her vacations. She got off the bookend days of the first weekend of July. I had told my mum a couple of days before to start scheduling the dental surgery. I confirmed with her with the more precise days. The time will be tight, but I think is enough to fit the two surgeries with their respective week of recovery before my departure to the States.

Linda confirmed that my plan is doable and sent me the website with the detailed process. I should start booking the flights and I must reserve down a hotel room before they run out. That is the first thing that I'll do tomorrow morning when I get to the office.

I have to go to the office tomorrow. I have a meeting with Louis and Boris scheduled after our Neuro meeting.

Yesterday was a year since the death of Anahí, Sonny's friend. She took a flight to Guadalajara to see Anahí's family and attend the mass.

Right now I am sitting on my living room. Black bird is playing on the television. I started watching it yesterday. It has been able to catch my attention. All these past weeks I hadn't been able to watch anything; nothing was interesting enough.

I have been seeing X-men 97. Before that I saw Baby Reindeer.

Last night I was waiting before ordering my take-out dinner; tonight, besides dinner, I am waiting before sending a follow-up text to Marie-Anne.

I am not sure if I still want to do it.

Thursday, when I was with Alda, she made a comment about intrusive thoughts and I let slip out how sometimes when I am going to take the metro, the thought of how easy it would be to push somebody standing there and end their life. I saw the surprise in her face and her immediate urge to hide it. I felt naked and embarrased. The conversation continued and I tried to forget it had happened by pushing the memory to the back of my head.

That was not the only time I felt burdened by something that I let out in conversation. When we were mindstorming the possible disappointing things my gut feeling was foretelling, I joked that I maybe I had gotten pregnant. Later in the evening when we failed to find the thrift store and were on our way to the metro, I told her that another possibility would be that I had gotten the girl pregnant. I felt soiled as the words escaped my mouth and wished I could catch them midway in the air and swallow them back. Even writing them here, I feel crawling ants tickling my spine.

Friday, when I was tempted by the idea of offering my journal to Bea, I sent a message to Alda consulting her if I could ask her two questions without being judged. After a couple of minutes, I decided to delete the text.

Her conversation stayed dormant all these days.

"Se me salió decirle a Alda que tengo pensamientos intrusivos de empujar a la gente en el metro y ya no me habla."

Sonny response was a one-word way of letting me know she was just as taken off as Alda.

"It's the end of the week and nothing's happened yet." I sent to Alda a couple of hours ago. Instantly, I sent he another text making emphasis on yet.

"What about now? Nothing yet?" She replied moments ago.

I thought about telling her about my date of today. I decided against it for some reason.

I offered Marie-Anne to meet her this time somewhere closer to her house. She said there was not much around and was fine with the idea of travelling a little. When I asked her if she had anything in mind, she reminded me she likes coffee. I offered her to have brunch. She told me she would get off at midnight and thus would prefer something not too early. We settled on meeting at Ginkgo at 11h. I remembered how I sat in a swing the last time I went there with Sonny, Vero and Alda. I made a reservation.

This morning I struggled getting out of bed. I postponed my alarm despite being already woken up by the sounds of the kids playing coming through my open window.

This time I also did not wear make up. I wore my denim jacket even though it was raining. Fortunately, I didn't have to stay outside too long waiting for the 30 bus.

I was onboard when I got an IG text from my date letting me known she was on her way and would be arriving in 5 minutes. I told her there was a reservation in my name in case she got there before me.

"You do remember my name, right?"

"Jane Doe, right?" I saw her response when I was standing between the two set of doors of the place. I asked her if she had already gotten in. She wasn't. I considered waiting for her there and getting our table together.

I was sitting down when she texted to ask me where I was. I told her to come inside and she would see me.

She sat down and our date started.

When we ordered, first our coffees and, on the second waitress' coming, our food, she complimented my French. I felt bad about not going on with my initial idea of offering her to have the full date in her native language.

Still, it ended up progressively getting more and more French. She kept apologizing for not being able to form phrases in English and taking my offer to formulate her thoughts in French. I made a comment about how she would let out her québécois accent more and more as she felt more at ease speaking her language. I didn't tell her I found it particularly attractive.

By the time we had finished our food and I ordered a refill on my coffee, she would maintain eye contact more and more.

The waitress was nice enough to not coming continuously to our table or giving us any pressure to leave.

At around 14h, she looked at her phone and told me she should be leaving and maybe go to sleep. I asked for our bills. We took our stuff and left. We were both going to Berri-UQAM, so we walked together.

As we left the café, she opened her umbrella and held it up silently inviting me in.

I thought about asking to kiss her.

Have you ever kissed under the rain?

Do you usually kiss on first dates? Did you want to on ours?

Instead, we just walked.

She asked me if I was going to take the blue line and I corrected her. When we got inside, she hugged me and we parted ways.

I held off texting her until around the time I started writing about our date.

"Alors, tu as-tu pu bien dormir ?"

She replied almost immediately and we continued talking for a bit. The banter flowed even more easy than our conversation earlier.

When I started this entry, the half-formed thought danced in my head how I should not reach out to Bea because I wouldn't be able to handle two rejections if Marie-Anne came back with that very familiar text I get after dates.

### Monday, May 6th, 2024

"Sorry that I didn't ask to kiss you, I thought that with the rain and everything it would've been a bit too romantic."

I fucking hate French class.

I am on the edge of just turning off my camera and stop logging in. These activities are more and more stupid. These can barely be considered an activity. Right now I am on a breakout room, hearing the maddenning white noise coming from the microphone of Hernando. I ignore if Éric porposefully sends me to be with Juan and him because we're all latino or if it's just a combination of bad luck and randomness.

It's been two thirds of the thirty minutes he has given us to complete this and nobody has said a fucking word.

Do I still need the money?

During the pause of French, I texted a bunch of people. I went into most of the conversations that had died and sent another message to bring them back. Some I wanted to, some others were completely meaningless. I did all of them anyway, as if I were to gain anything by completing all of them. In the end, I closed everything by sending the one-sentence over-thought text to Bea. That is the only one that I wish goes unanswered.

Why then did I feel compulsed to do it?

Were she to text me back, more than excitement, I'd feel full of anguish before opening it.

Why then has the thought been hanging around all these days like a curse?

Éric is going around asking for the conjugation of different verbs in the subjonctif.

I turned down my phone over the desk. I feel shivers crawling down my arms despite the temperature being over 24 degrees.

I am again a prisoner of my own impulses.

We are now going still so slowly hearing a set of phrases to differentiate the verbs conjugated in le futur antérieur and those in le futur simple. The professor is repeating the phrases in an even slower voice putting artificial emphasis on the important words.

Meanwhile, the phone is silently screaming at me. It's distracting. I decided to continue writing these words as a way to muffle its callings. It's barely working.

I don't know why I so eagerly want to turn over the screen. Will I feel relieved that nothing has happened yet, or the absence of news will just mean a prevalence of this anxiety?

I should follow Marie-Anne's guidance and take care of my own injuries before I start any kind of relationship, being it serious or not.

Last night we continued our playful conversation without any issue. I could have left it with my second to last message where I told her I would let her sleep since she clearly needed it. Had that been the last message we would've probably gone on a third date some day, instead now I am tempted to stop following her like I did with Chloé; instead now I am writing about her.

"Nevermind, something did happen," I texted Alda at 23h17. "Just in time."

She took her time to see it and I intentionally ignored my phone. When I failed on that task, I saw she had seen my message around 10 minutes before. I thought—and would have definitely preferred it—that the text would be the endpoint of our short story.

What I got instead, was an uncomfortable response.

"Hey, I didn't want to leave you on read, but I was a bit flustered by your message," she started. "I am shy with new people, and we don't know each other very well. I need time to really get any desire to kiss or be affectionate. I still feel a little bit broken and thought I had time to take care of my heart before going through more emotions with it."

The first response that my body and/or mind came up with was to apologize.

I looked up the precise meaning of being flustered. It was still not clear to me when so I just told her I was sorry for making her uncomfortable. That message remained unreplied.

Or at least it did until the morning.

I kept postponing the alarm and thus the start of my day. One of the times that I went to check the amount of time I was losing in bed, I saw the notification of a new message that started saying she was going to write in French in order to better communicate that she had to say to me. I dismissed the notification and remained in bed for another half an hour.

Just like I avoided the morning, I avoided the text until the evening.

I showered and got ready. I could not stay home today, not because of the Neuro meeting—which I could probably could have joined by Teams—, but for the one we had with Bratislav right after.

Despite spending most of the morning lying down with my head buried in my pillow, I was not pressed on time. I left the house around 11h. I considered passing by the bakery to get some breakfast. While I was brewing my coffee, I saw how I had 14 minutes to leave in order to catch the necessary metro that would leave me in the precise moment to take the 144 bus. I made it just in time.

When I stepped out of station Sherbrooke, there were 3 minutes left before the scheduled departure of the bus. I stood in line behind a blond girl wearing green headphones. I did not pay attention on her until we boarded the bus and I sat on the seat behind her. There was something about her neck, white and soft behind a waterfall of yellow strands.

At my stop, I pulled the cord of the same colour and got off.

I walked in through the garage of the gymnasium. I don't think the usual entrance is still cordoned off, but I take this longer path just to avoid the looks of any construction man.

When I got to the office, Daniel was the only one there. Neda arrived before our meeting. Vlad did not come today.

During my morning, I payed for my registration of AAIC. I needed to validate my status as a student before confirming my registration. The e-mail asking for a letter of enrollment said that the process could take between 3 and 5 days. Once that is over, I will be able to book the hotel.

I got an email from the Wellness hub asking me to confirm my appointment with Dr Franck this Thursday morning. It was just 15 minutes before my scheduled appointment for the bloodwork, so I decided to reschedule the latter. I moved it to the following Monday.

Later in the morning, Aliza asked me if I was going to the HBHL summit later this week. She is going to present there. When I tried to register, I saw that I could only get into the wait list for the first day, and that the second one was already sold-out. She mentioned as well the QBIN scientific day that is happening in Concordia. I could register for that one, but it was the same Monday that I had moved on my bloodwork appointment, so I, again, had to move it.

I started working on the technical description of my Qrater software. I did not finish it by the time we started getting up to go to Louis' office.

He told us about his process when looking for papers, reading, annotate, and categorize them for the writing of his grant. It was a casual and amene talk. We talked briefly about the opportunities in the future before the meeting ended at around 14h30.

When we started getting up and putting the chairs back to their place, he offered me to go meet with Bratislav right away. I told him I was free if he was, but wasn't sure that Bratislav would be available. He insisted we could just go up and check. I followed him to almost the same office we had gone a couple of months ago. This time we mistakenly knocked on the wrong door. There was nobody there so we decided to come back later.

I went back down and sat down in my chair without doing any work. I browsed my phone listening to music. A couple of minutes before 15h, I stood up and went towards Louis' office as we had agreed. I met him instead outside the door to the lobby.

We had our meeting with Bratislav. It started with comments about the posters he had framed on his office. They were all of the same director and in the same artistic style. I don't remember which director nor any of the titles. He cleared out some of the doubts we had and gave us some interesting suggestions. When we walked down, we remained on that same spot we had met moments before and cleared up the plans moving forward with the project.

I went back inside and grabbed my stuff. I didn't take the bus nor the green line and instead walked the way to station Sherbrooke.

### Tuesday, May 7th, 2024

"Hey Sofía, I'm sorry for the late reply. I've found someone who I want to explore a relationship with so I can't meet up with you again. I'm really sorry; you are so lovely and I had a nice time and I wish you all the best."

I was lying down in bed, tired of the weight of not having done anything productive throughout the day, when I glanced at my phone and saw the number one atop the messages app. I knew exactly what it presaged.

I focused on the message's bookends, my correctly accentuated name on one end and the red heart on the other. I am starting to hate the sight of red hearts.

This time I didn't fool myself with the naïve idea that I'd be relieved by some sort of calm after having an answer. This end hurt. The disappearance of my unrecognized hopes left a hole inside me that took my breath away.

Four hours; two liters of alcohol. That's all it took. A pleasant conversation; a series smoke-flavoured kisses; a chilly walk to her apartment. One night of caresses, of childhood memories and secrets shared in soft touches and even softer voices.

Is it intimacy what I've been craving for?

I keep telling everyone, from Fabiola, to Alda, Aliza and Sonny, even to myself, that I am not looking for a relationship; that it is not what I want. Why, then, when I read that sentence was I waterboarded by the thought of why couldn't it have been me?

  I talked about it in therapy.

All throughout French class I felt unmotivated and distracted. The professor was busy with something so he gave us the link to 6 pages of activities in Classkick and sent us out to breakout rooms.

I was tempted to turn off my webcam and ignore them, but I felt guilty with the cheerful Fan. The timer on the top of the breakout room marked around 35 minutes. Fortunately, with the help of chatGPT to come up with some ideas for the phrases I finished the complete exercise in around 10 minutes. I turned off my camera and moved on to write the previous paragraphs.

After a while Éric came back to check up on us. I turned my camera back on. Ishea asked him a question. He then asked us if we were all on page 3 then.

"Non, j'ai déjà terminé."

He made a comment about me being super quick, but I had no energy to fake up a smile. He went to check on the document—maybe he wanted to make sure I did have finished it—and corrected some of my mistakes. He considered the idea of giving me another thing to do, but decided against it since we would all be returning soon.

The rest of the class was about correcting together the exercise. Since he had seen mine, I shut off my head and stopped paying attention, except when he called my name twice asking for my response.

I can't remember what I did during the pause.

Several times I felt like crying. I would rub my red eyes and hoped that the definition of my camera was not high enough to let anyone notice that I was not having a good time.

My head is hurting from all the crying. I think I hurt more with this text than the one I got from Sophie—was it a month ago?

When the class finally ended, I logged off without saying good-bye. I had five minutes to go to the restroom before my session with Fabiola. I was still lying down at 11h30, when I texted her asking her if our session was going to be at our usual time or during the evening after my French class. She responded pretty quickly and I were able to continue avoiding the day.

I didn't want to talk about Bea. I didn't want to talk about Marie-Anne. I didn't want to be told that it's better for me to take a break from dating or trying to meet new people in a romantic way.

What hurt the most about Bea's text was the reinforcement of my deep belief that I am not worthy of love. People go out on dates with me, but they won't feel any romantic attraction in person; they can kiss me and take me to their place to have sex, but I am not enough to be the one to have a relationship with.

### Friday, May 10th, 2024

"I mean, you have some good good passing, as a woman."

Dr Franck lowered my dose.

I picked up the medicine from the pharmacy today in the afternoon. I mistook médicaments for médecins. Dr sent only a prescription for the sleeping pills since I had just enough Latuda to last me the following two weeks before our next session.

In the early morning, I sent Louis an e-mail asking him to postpone our meeting together. I wrote that I wasn't feeling very well and had an appointment with a doctor later in the day. I purposefully sent it very early in the morning as if that were to made any difference.

Fortunately, I doubted my own calendar event and double-checked the confirmation e-mail from the Wellness Hub one of the times I went to postpone the alarm. Instead of 10h, this week the appointment was at 8h30. I got out of bed and sat down in front of the computer despite having around 30 minutes before the scheduled call. I could have brewed some coffee in the meantime but lacked the motivation for it.

I told him I've been very depressed and he seemed concerned. He asked me why and if I had talked about it with my therapist from Mexico. I thought about Bea, but I said that I didn't know. After what I thought was a lie, I realized that I had been depressed for two weeks before meeting Bea.

He asked me what I wanted to do. I shared with him my hesitance of increasing the dosage. He let me know that lowering it was also an option. We could try going back to 20mg, maybe the depression was another of the side effects of a high dose. We settled on that.

After the call ended I went back to bed and slept for what felt like the whole week.

Yesterday I matched with a new woman on tinder. She's in vet school in a town 50 km away from the city. She started the conversation asking me about my line of looking at brains for a living. I continued the conversation despite she being so far away, despite telling Aliza that I am over this.

"Wey, hoy tuve noticias de Bea—la del diente—y me pegó y creo que sí quiero una relación," I texted her Tuesday night before asking her for our plans this Saturday.

She had proposed me to meet this weekend. I told her that, after telling me all the gossip from the wedding, I could use the opportunity to let all out concerning what had happened with Bea and my latest date with Marie-Anne. I wanted to tell her the full story about having too much of a good time during the date, losing my tooth during a casual hook-up, and foolishly fall under empty promises; I wanted to tell her, too, about being subtly prompted to go out on a second date with someone who had just realized was not ready for anything romantic.

After all that, I got a response. I got my answer. I got another thing to talk about.

Sabrina, the newest match of tinder, asked me out this weekend. She proposed having a picnic and mentioned Mont-Royal. I offered, instead, going to Canal Lachine or Parc La Fontaine. She decided on the latter. We'll meet on the southwestern corner of the park and look for someplace to get food.

I've gone on several dates on Parc Lafontaine. One of them was with Laura, the colombian girl with whom I take pictures. Another was a French girl with whom I talked about movies. I follow the former on instagram still, she's back in Colombia from what I know. I never texted the latter again. I didn't feel attracted to any of them. I still fell let down when they didn't reach out to me. Were they able to tell I wasn't into them? Am I the only one who is not capable of that? Maybe I don't let myself believe it. Maybe the same reason that pushes me to reach out to people I had mediocre dates is the one that made me text Sophie three weeks after she never responded to my text and reach out a second time to Bea despite fully expecting to be disappointed.

When I first talk with Aliza about meeting early in the week, I told her about a new girl who had asked me out. I hadn't confirmed her yet and wasn't sure I wanted to. I told her it was not a hook-up meeting but rather someone in an open relationship.

"Sí, nada bueno puede pasar, anyway," I texted her. "Me puede ayudar a convencerme de ya dejarlo por la paz."

"Dude, no sabes ni lo que tú ni ella quieren." She was not too convinced.

After Bea's text, I finally let myself say that I want a relationship and I dealt with the bunch of emotions that came with that came with that realization.

In the end I didn't cancel my meeting with Camille. I knew very well that I wouldn't get what I am looking for from her. I confirmed with her about meeting today the same night that I realized for sure that we were not compatible.

We were gonna meet at 14h at La graine brûlée. I could stay in bed until after noon.

The night before was my first night taking the new 20mg dose. It was probably psychological, but I woke up early and I could have probably started my day one of those times that I pushed the alarm. I was not ready to feel better, so I went back to hide in my dreams.

Around 11h, I heard a knock in the door.

I wasn't sure if it had been real or if I had imagined it. I took off the covers and realized that I was in my underwear. Someone knocked on the door again, and I stood up to put on my shorts that were lying on the floor. I became aware that it was Friday morning and I was going to answer the door in my pijamas, with swollen eyes and morning hair. I started walking towards the door, when I heard a similar knock but a bit further away. I stopped in the dark. Whoever it was at my door decided to try the apartment next door. That neighbor was quicker in answering.

I heard the voice of my landlord. Both of them spoke in French. It was both too quick and too early for me to be able to get what they were talking about.

A couple of days ago he sent me an email as a reminder that next month is the last rent payment of the contract and is time to set up the new checks. He gave me the address to deliver them. I looked up and the registered mail takes only a couple of days and costs between 10 and 20 CADs.

If it were important, he will try again; he has my number and my email.

I went back to bed since I had another two hours before I needed to get up.

I thought about sending a text to confirm our date and, shortly after, I considered sending one instead cancelling it. I had no motivation to look for clothes, to shower and do my hair. I wanted nothing that made me get out of the house and see people or being seen by anyone.

I put on the dark red pants with the creamy brown t-shirt. It was not a good match. As soon as I stepped off the house, I realized that my top was too short and my pants hanged too low. I kept having to pull the waist of my pants up as I felt like my clothes were not covering the top of my ass.

I rode the metro up to station Berri-UQAM. I was just in time after the short walk. I briefly checked my phone for notifications before going inside. I looked around without intentions when Camille recognized me. She was bigger than me and I am not sure how that made me feel. She was carrying a blue glass with a slice of lemon inside. She opened her arms to hug me and noticed her flowery summer dress. I told her I would go to the front to order and I let her find a place to sit. Before I made it to the baristas I was sure that I wouldn't get anything out of our date. I felt guilty about my lack of interest or attraction. And then I felt self-disgust by wondering if this is how all the women who sent me rejection texts fell when they met me.

I went on a date once before at that café. We sat by the window. She was wearing a red scottish skirt. Did she know, too, as soon as she saw me that there was no romantic attraction towards me?

Why is it so easy for me to believe that most women I've dated were disappointed by my looks as soon as they saw me?

Amanda, Valerie, Alexandra, Bea. All of them met me and asked to kiss me.

When the québécoise girl took my clothes off, she let me know that I was so fucking hot.

Why can't I just believe it? What do I need to be convinced that I am worthy of attraction, of love?

### Sunday, May 12th, 2024

"Ya borré las apps."

I could have come back home and sit down to write. I was not drunk; either by alcohol nor sadness. I was exhausted.

Whenever people would ask me about my first kiss I discard a memory; a small footnote in my history, an event that doesn't really count.

Why am I thinking about this now?

Why am I finding it so hard to write about it?

After just a couple of nights with the new dose, it was easier to wake up in the morning. I could have gotten up and had a cup of coffee. I stayed in bed like as if I had not gotten any better.

I put on the same t-shirt that I had worn the day before for another soul-draining date. Before I put it on I sniffed its armpits and caught a mild scent of sweetness and melancholy. This time I wore clean and well-fitting jeans.

I folded my blanket. Together with my water bottle, it went inside my black backpack. I sheltered my thoughts with my noise-cancelling headphones. The walk towards the park was longer than the one towards the metro; both were quiet and uneventful.

There was a long line coming out of the entrance to St-Viateur café. That had been one of the options I gave Sabrina for where we could get our food.

Late at night, before I went to bed, Sabrina reached out asking me if I had any dietary restrictions. I confessed to her that I don't eat cheese. I further explained that I can eat it sometimes, mixed with other stuff, but that I don't love it.

"We shouldn't go to the poutine place, then!"

"That's one of my many contradictions," I offered, explaining that I love pizza and poutine.

"Well, I like someone who's complex."

I got to the corner of the park where we were supposed to meet. After I crossed the street, I waited for the coming traffic in the inside circuit surrounding the park. I read the new message in Tinder where Sabrina was letting me know she had made it. A honk aggressively snatched me out of the chat. The mail van had stopped to let me cross, but one of the cars behind it disagreed with his cordial gesture.

After I asked her, she let me know she was by the entrance further up north. I promised her I'd go look for her. I missed her last message in which she told me she was sitting on a concrete bench.

I found her anyway.

I did not see the excitement dissipate from her gaze as she raised it meeting mine.

The date started and ended, like all those unnarrated other ones have done. If I were not to write its details, it would just be another nameless entry in the list of forgotten memories.

We got out of the park and walked towards the restaurants. We decided for ma poule mouillée, since I prefer it and she hadn't tried. We waited around 10 minutes in line before getting in and ordering our food.

She wanted to go to the restroom. I offered to order for her, but she decided to wait. We paid separately. I held her bag and waited for her on the thin table by the exit.

We went back to the park and found a spot to lay on the grass. The both of us had brought blankets. We placed both of them down, one above the other, and sat down next to each other.

We talked between bites. After around 40 minutes, I gave up on my food and just covered it again. We continued talking under the warm sunlight filtered by the tree shadows.

She had brought pastries and offered me one of them. I was not hungry, but I forced myself to accept her gesture. I grabbed and finished an apple-filled pie. She picked a chocolatine amandes.

More time passed and she made a comment about paying her parking. She asked me if I was planning of staying for longer considering the idea of extending the time on the running meter. I thought back to my strategic urgence to leave the date with Camille the day before. I told her I had no rush since my meeting with my friend wasn't until later in the evening.

Maybe she expected a different answer and just didn't know how to make use of the viable exit. She decided to stay and we continued our conversation about travelling.

Like the date on the day before, we both laughed at each other's stories and the conversation flowed. What made these conversations different to other dates? What did these lack that were present in others. What made so special the evening with Amanda on the sushi place; the night conversation in French with Alexia at Le Darling; the brisk evening at Pamplemousse and the calmer one at N with Sophie; the unfinished pints with Bea at Typhoon Lounge.

Is it attraction? I was attracted to all of these women; were they also attracted to me?

I kissed all of them. With most, I spend the night.

Does that mean anything at all?

Sabrina and I moved from our spot. She made a comment about turning red—was that her way of subtly laying out the groundwork for leaving?—and I offered her to get up and walked around. We put our leftover food back into their paperbags. She offered me one of the remaining pastries. I had the cold chocolatine as breakfast this morning. I helped her fold her blanket.

We explored the park as if I also had never been there before. We wondered about the reason behind the empty lake. We looked at the dancing teenagers inside the puppet theater. We investigated the purpose of the building in the center of the park. We commented on the number of people who had the same idea of us and who had decided to have a picnic enjoying the coming of spring. We reached a bench where we sat down and continued talking. She had asked me about sports as we saw kids play with their families. She continued talking about horse-riding.

This time, when she brought up the subject of parking after looking at her phone, she made use of it.

We walked towards the place we had met earlier—she had said when I asked her that she found parking somewhere nearby.

"I think I am leaving now," I said abruptly the day before to Camille.

"I am going to stay for a bit, but I'll get up to give you a hug," she said back, nicer than I deserved.

Sabrina hugged me, too. I was overly conscious of neither of us acknowledging the idea of meeting again. She wished me a good rest of the day and I reciprocated the gesture. As I walked by the dumpling spot, I realized I never really thanked her for baked goods. Later in the evening, I considered the idea of texting her and making a comment about it. I had a nice time with you, thank you for the pastries; I could even add the cruel and unneded unfortunately, I don't see this going any further.

I did not do it.

I made it home with plenty of time before my planned evening with Aliza.

I took off my pants and let them fall lifeless on the ground. I unhooked my bra under my t-shirt and threw it towards the bag filled with underwear that I've still procrastinated putting away. I crawled exhausted under the covers and rested my head on the pillow. The pillow smelt like dying flowers. If depression had a smell, I imagine it would be that withering sweetness. I made a mental note of changing the sheets. Like many other chores, I have not yet done it.

I calculated the time needed to get to Aliza's house. I put an alarm for 17h50, giving me enough time to put my clothes back on. I did not sleep—I think—but I still postponed the alarm.

"19H? Quieres que lleve algo? Do you mind if I drink?" I had texted Aliza before giving up on my afternoon.

"I know you'll drink."

I left later than planned. I made a stop at the dépanneur. I went inside with the intention of buying the box of four dieu du ciel! strong beers. Just one of them would be enough to get me sweetly drunk, and I could bring back home the other three for taking leasurely throughout the week.

I did not take my headphones off. I stood in front of the open fridge and looked towards the beers. The boxes I was looking for were not there. I was stumped. I looked at the different options and struggled to make up my mind.

After around 5 minutes, I grabbed a four-pack of ciders and went towards the cashier to pay.

At Aliza's we talked about the wedding, her catharthic meeting with Ali, and the unwanted and unwelcome intents of reaching out from Danny. I told her the details about Bea and what had happened with Marie-Anne; I did not go into the details of my latest two dates.

Aliza made a comment of how tired I look.

In the middle of our conversations, she took a picture of me leaning on the back of her couch. She sent it to our conversation with Sonny. I did not see it until later in the night even though she openly made a comment about it.

I looked at the image of myself and was repulsed by it. I was more put off than how I had been two days ago when I first saw Camille. I thought back to my walk towards the entrance by the Brébeuf street, and felt my skin tighthen as I imagined the disgust that Sabrina must have felt when she laid eyes upon me.

Aliza offered to get dinner for us, but I rejected the idea and thus she got herself a cheese pizza. I can count with my fingers the chips that I ate. I had brought my gifted chocolatine, but it stayed wrapped in foil on her coffee table.

I made it home and, just like the night before, I took my antipsychotics without any food.

### Monday, May 13th, 2024

 He was getting good at knowing if this was a nonstarter—the way eyes lost brightness when they were reflecting disappointment; a politeness that was trying to clean up the disappointment; the same wall I put up that first night we met when I realized I couldn't bear how short he was.

—Fleishman is in trouble, Taffy Brodesser-Akner.

After deleting the apps yesterday, I redownloaded and opened them again to unmatch both Camille and Sabrina, before—just like these two woman—carelessly discard them again.

When Alda returned to me the question I had sent her about her weekend and I told her about my two dates and having deleted the apps, instead of a comment she had a question.

"For how long this time?"

This was the first night in I don't know how many weeks I actually slept less than eight hours.

I could have gotten up earlier, but since there would be breakfast and coffee at Google HQ before the workshop, there was no incentive of leaving my bed to brew and enjoy my coffee.

After showering and dressing, I laid down at the bottom of my bed with my head hanging off it for the free 30 minutes I had. No thought nor revelation was worthy of remembering.

As usual, I wore my headphones from before putting my shoes on, during the longer ride of the orange metro line, when I got off station Square Victoria OACI, up to the moment that both map apps miscalculated my position and made me doubt I was on the right street which then forced me to go around the building. I stopped the music and took them off as I started looking for the entry.

I came inside and followed a guy with a blue backpack who seemed sure of where he was going. He nonchalantly passed the security desk. I turned my face towards the security guard but continued stepping on his invisible footprints. I saw he presented an ID card to the screen that served as an electric doorman to the 6 elevators.

I went back to the ignored security woman and, since she greeted me in French, I asked her the whereabouts of my destination in her language.

She answered me in English before echoing herself in French.

I pressed the number nine and turned to go through the doors that opened behind me almost instantly.

When I came out of the elevator I faced a second security guard. I announced to him the intentions behind my presence and he told me to wait for someone to come for me. Not long, the elevator opened again and a woman came out from it to lead me into the 11th floor where the registration desk, breakfast, and the small conference room had place.

After grabbing the label with my printed name and put it over my left breast, another man guided me to where I could leave my jacket in one of the closets surrounding the entrance of the conference room, and then the long hall where the breakfast was already served.

I saw a line formed and I stood there. I saw Daniel standing on the table with a filled plate surrounded by people yet eating by himsef. He smiled towards me acknowledging my presence. I stayed in line for half a minute before I changed my mind and decided to skip breakfast.

I stepped off and walked directly towards the coffee station. I served my coffee on one of their mugs and carried it towards where Daniel was. He met me halfway wondering where he could put his dish and I pointed to a small wooden table that had empty dishes.

Instead of placing myself on the recently vacant place left by him, I sat down in front of a window, giving my back to the view, to drink my coffee in quiet solitude.

I eavesdropped the conversation that was happening on the end of the communal table. There was a guy with a gray sweatshirt with graduate neuroscience engraved on his chest.

I continued looking at the people chatting and eating their free food. I let time pass in front of me in between the sips of my drink.

The talks were uneventful and unimportant.

The second one, where the same woman that is going to be another talk tomorrow afternoon in French talked about the available models developed at Google, made me think about the idea of downloading and installing a local instance of llama and try to do something with the digital record of the more than 750k words that comprise this journal.

I met with Daniel at the exit after going to the restroom. We walked together to McGill. We passed the encampment and got into a building that I've never been in before.

Neda was already in the hall where lunch had been served. She was sitting by herself on a table by the end in front of one of the two big screens.

This time I didn't skip the free food. Following Daniel's initiative, I grabbed two wraps—one vegetarian and a second of chicken salad—,some veggies and two tablespoons of what I think was hummus. To drink, I had a second cup of coffee.

We went to seat with Neda and the three of us ate and talked together for the 30 minutes we had to spare before the start of the talk.

Daniel went ahead and grabbed a third wrap. Without knowing, he convinced me to get the brownie that was tempting me. This time, instead of coffee, I served myself black tea with a splash of milk.

Neda asked me about my weekend, specifically if I had done anything fun.

I thought about my weekend preceded by an empty week and which started prematurely on Friday with a date at La grain brûlée, followed by a second one the next day at Parc La Fontaine, and finished—just as prematurely—with a night of calmed and muffled catharsis at Aliza's.

"Not really," I summarized.

"Oh, it's fine just staying home and chilling," she encouraged me.

"Oh no. I did do some stuff. It just wasn't fun."

I enjoyed the third talk much better than the first two ones at Google.

When it finished, I asked Neda and Daniel if they were considering staying for the panel. Since neither of them would, I decided to leave, too.

Neda walked out from a different exit than Daniel and I. The two of us walked back to downtown in direction of the metro station. He guided me through one of the entrances to the RESO—when we where at Les Cours Mont-Royal, which I mistakenly thought was Eaton Place, he asked me if I was going to continue in direction to station McGill which was a bit further away; I instead took the unsaid option of walking with him to Peel.

When we took our own ways to our respective platforms going in opposite directions, I forgot to put on my headphones. I rode the metro in silence and, leaving station Jarry, I consciously decided to continue walking without any music to quiet my thoughts.

I considered the idea of stopping at SAQ. There was just enough left on the bottle of vodka in the freezer for a single drink. There are stickers in the windows announcing a strike soon to come. It would certainly be opened, but I still didn't cross the street and went straight ahead.

The thought came again a second time in the form of an impulse to cross the street a couple of blocks ahead and go inside the dépanneur for a pack of beers that I could milk throughout the week. This time I did wait for the light to turn green at the intersection. After crossing I continued walking and made it home—a couple of hours early, without carrying any music or new alcohol.

I laid down on my couch and faced a younger, half-formed impulse that I had been carrying all day, and started pulsing around inside me on my walk home without any music to calm it down. I made a plan as I opened the app store looking for the apps that I had recently deleted. Don't recover the account; no swiping on any one new. Only reply to conversations from someone other than the people I just met. If they have texted back, read their message but certainly don't answer—no matter what they say.

There were no new messages from anyone old or new. I deleted the apps again, after satiating the paradoxical anxiety of being rejected by someone to whom I had felt no attraction.

Before French I put on another episode of the series that I started yesterday, Fleishman is in trouble. The last episode is playing right now as I am writing this as midnight is approaching.

Five minutes before the start of the class, I took out the headphones from my backpack and turned on the screen of my computer. As I awaited the class to start, I redownloaded the apps again and unmatched the two women I met on the weekend, snatching the capacity of rejecting me from them.

Last night, before falling asleep, I told Sonny what I couldn't seem to write yesterday.

"No estoy segura, pero creo que mi primer beso fue sexual assault."

### Tuesday, May 14th, 2024

"I feel that, like womanhood, I am appropriating something that doesn't belong to me."

I woke up around two or three times before the final alarm. It wasn't too hard to go back to sleep. Even though the alarm was an hour later than yesterday's, I had not enough energy to push myself out of bed. I managed to do it anyway.

I didn't brew any coffee nor bought any pastry for breakfast.

I rode the orange and green lines until station Peel. I lost my breath on the second half of the hill of Rue Peel. I arrived 15 minutes earlier than my appointment.

There was a guy on the panel that welcomed me in. When I told him I was there for bloodwork he asked me if I had a requisition. My affirmation was not enough to assure him and he questioned then if it was from someone at the hub. I said yes again. He still excused himself and went to talk to someone instead of clicking on the screen behind him.

He invited me in to go straight to counter five, where one of the ladies I recognized called me in by wishing me a good morning. She did the same questions and demanded the name of the doctor.

"Doctor Perera," I said and, as if I had said open sesame, she sent me upstairs.

I walked down the corridor to the small waiting room. I sat down on the chair and glanced to the brochures next to me. I looked at one that asked if I were a man between a specific range of age, but grabbed the same one addressed for women. It was about a vaccine to prevent different kind of cancer by the HPV. I realized that when turned it'd become the other version.

Another girl came and sat on one of the chairs facing me. She was blonde and had an aura of vulnerability around her that made her seem younger. She never looked at me and I wasn't sure if that was disappointing or relieving.

The phlebotomist came to us and asked her for her appointment time.

"9h45."

"And yours?" He asked almost at the same time that he turned his face towards me.

"10h."

"You go first." His face returned to her.

She went with him into the little office.

When she came out much sooner than I would have expected, she had her arm bent and was carrying her jacket with her other arm.

He invited me in with words that I have forgotten. I sat down on the chair and, after I gave him my name, he printed much more labels than I was expecting. He asked me if I have a problem with needles and I said no. I did not feel it go in. I looked at the crimson liquid slip through the thin hose out of my body as he filled the three small tubes.

He let me know that Dr Perera had requested a urine test as well. I suddenly became conscious of my bladder's unusual emptiness. I told him I had no idea, but I could try my best. He added that they would come to do the pick up in 20 minutes and I confidently said that I could make it. He took out two small bottles and wrote something on their lids with a sharpie pen. He draw a line around halfway up on the first one and then a much lower line on the second one. He instructed me to fill them both to those respective lines in the same order he had marked them.

I went into the restroom and locked the door. I saw on the wall a poster with the detailed procedure of urinating on the bottles separated by sex. It instructed me to wash my hands beforehand, pull back the foreskin, and wipe the glans of my penis.

By mere curiosity I read the instructions on the left hand side of the poster that described what I should be doing had I been born cis. I was halfway through it when I felt too dysphoric to continue.

I washed my hands and dried them. I opened both of the bottles and placed them uptop of the toiletpaper holder. I pulled my pants down and grabbed the first bottle.

Fortunately, I could pee.

Unfortunately, it was not enough to fill even one bottle.

I kept trying as if I could generate more urine by mere willpower. I drank the water that was in my bottle, but that was not enough. I filled it up and drank it two or three times in the 30 minutes I stayed in the restroom.

When I finally gave up, I went outside and told the lady at the desk of my situation. I told her I could come back another time if it was necessary. She went to the phlebotomist carrying the plastic bag marked as biohazard. I left her explained him the situation and didn't went join them until after a full minute.

In the end, he said it was fine. They would make it work with what I had done. They did need to print another sheet since they had come already to pick up the materials. I again offered to come back another time since they wouldn't pick it up today, but the woman assured me that it would be picked up—they come four times in the day.

I asked if then that was it. They let me go.

I walked the short distance to the symposium. I went to the registration desk. The girl sitting there with the lists told me she had recognized me from the day before. I still gave her my name. She struggled to find me and I got nervous that I had just been registered for the first day. She found me.

I grabbed a small cup of coffee and took it with me to the panel.

"It's interesting that we have opposite experiences! Maybe it's because the stuff I do is much more complicated, what do you program?" asked the guy in first year of software engineering to a political science phd candidate that works with LLM and NLP to analyze politician's discourse.

I had to leave early because all of the water I had drunk in the restroom had already turned into urine.

I walked upstairs for lunch. I sat down on the same table as yesterday. Daniel arrived and sat down next to me. I couldn't tell him of the amusing event since the freshman and the other undergrad from Dawson that had been on the panel were sitting in the same table as us.

We went to the talk that was in French, but neither of us paid much attention.

Although I was interested in the panel of researchers, I left early.

I felt exhausted enough that I slept before my French class.

I could talk about my session with Fabiola. I feel too tired to go into details.

### Wednesday, May 15th, 2024

Ya me reservaron para el sábado 22. ¿No quieres reservarme unos días tú también?

Last night I went to bed with the full intention of getting up in the morning and going to the lab. I promised Aliza that, after going two days to McGill campus, I would go twice to the office this week.

I don't remember if it was also last night that I allow myself to push the alarm a couple of hours and arrive to the lab in the middle of the morning rather than start my day there.

I can't remember the last time that I woke up in the middle of the night incapable of falling back asleep. Last night I was exhausted. I continously slept and I wanted to remain that way. I turned off the alarm and decided to connect to Daniel's mock defense remotely.

Tomorrow, I have to go to the office.

It's harder and harder to connect to French class. I hate every moment of this. It's a waste of time. Whenever we're not doing exercises for stuff that we should already know, we're spending the whole class correcting them—and I have to bear listening to some of the classmates struggle to understand.

A couple of days ago I looked up the start of the next session. It will be the Monday during the visit of Cris, Paty, and Sonny. The next day I have the appointment with the dentist. Last class the Éric asked us who was not going to stay in the course and I remained silent. I figured that I can always register and just stop connecting. Right now, I am not even sure I will be able to finish the next four weeks.

It's almost midnight. I don't have the energy nor the motivation to finish writing, but I already started.

Éric sent us to breakout rooms to talk about two different topics. Fortunately Mariana was in my group, so it never lacked a person who was eager to talk. I stayed quiet for most of the 25 minutes he set apart for that activity.

After that we did a dictée, as he tends to like to do most last days of the week. I know it's cheating, but I open a web browser on the side and sthealthily write some of the sentences he dictates to make sure of the spelling, specficially the accents. I don't do it on all of the phrases, and, most of the time, it's to confirm what my gut tells me.

He repeats the phrases multiple times. Even then, he's asked to repeat them more. As soon as he said point final, I grabbed my phone to send him the picture and get off. This time he didn't receive our e-mails instantaneously. Still, the class ended around 15 minutes before 21h.

Next Monday there won't be a class.

Tomorrow I have to get up and I have to go to the lab. I can't stay home two days in a row.

I did do some work today. I finished the technical report for Qrater after the class ended. I sent it to Louis in a late e-mail.

"Sorry for taking so long with this, these have been a bit rough couple of weeks," I signed off my mail. I am sure tomorrow he will ask me about it—if he read the e-mail, that is.

I ate before class. I made some soup and had a sandwich. I was very hungry.

I've been trying to eat less. As little as possible. I feel disgusted with my weight. I have been weighting me daily. The numbers haven't been going down. They haven't increased either.

I was tempted to order myself a burger, but managed to hold it off. I had a pita with hummus, bologna, and a fried egg with the rest of the soup instead.

That was around an hour ago. Probably more. I haven't gotten the annoying side effects of the medication with the lowered dosage.

Time seems weird to me now.

I feel exhausted, but I don't know if I will be able to fall asleep easily. I did get up very late today.

Tomorrow I have to go to the lab.

I won't be waking up at 7h45. I can get up a bit later. But I do have to go.

A couple of days ago, I felt again the motivation to write a book. Some days before that, I wanted to continue editing the journal. What happened to that new-found energy?

### Thursday, May 16th, 2024

"Hope you are feeling better. Let me know if I can do anything."

—Louis.

The bar is full now.

For the first time in a while, there are more sounds outside than inside my head.

A couple of tables to my left, I was sitting with Sonny the last day I saw her. I took a couple of pictures with my film camera—have I really not taken any pictures since that day?

I had thought a couple of times about coming back here, by myself. I came to the area maybe two or three times to get myself a box of gnocchi. I hadn't come to the bar, but I did think about it. I thought about bringing my laptop and working on something while I sip a glass of the beer I like but can't find on the supermarket anymore.

I thought about it this morning—no, it was last night, since I connected the computer to charge it. I took my laptop in my backpack to the office with the full intention of fulfulling my unrealized plan.

I was not supposed to come to this bar. What I thought yesterday and this morning was turning left when exiting station Jarry and heading to Etoh. I must have been at the office when I remembered this place instead. It is my favourite beer in Montréal, after all.

It was even harder to wake up this morning. The guilt of cancelling another meeting with Louis was stronger than my impulse to remain hidden from the world under my pillows. Somewhen during last night, I opened the shadows, and the sunlight crept into my room since 5h. I lacked the energy to get up and fixing my situation. I was exhausted enough that I could continue sleeping until around 9h.

I kept checking my mail hoping for a mail from Louis letting us all know that he was going to work from home today. I did get an e-mail from Louis but it was not what I expected. He got back about the Qrater changes I sent him last night. He had no comments nor suggestions. I can resubmit the paper whenever I feel ready.

At around 9h30, I uncovered my body and finally felt ready to face the world. I grabbed a clean t-shirt and a set of underwear from my drawers. I weighted myself in the bathroom and realized that I'm a kilogram heavier. Yesterday, throughout the day I ate a full packet of soup. I am conscious it might just be water from all of the sodium in that soup. I still felt like shit.

I considered making a stop at the bakery, but decided against it.

When I got to the office, Neda and Daniel were working on their own stuff. Neda asked me how I was doing, but I didn't get into details. Vlad joined us not much after I arrived. The first time that Louis came to visit us, he didn't acknowledge me—he just let us know that he had submitted a request to lower the thermostat in the office and that it had been approved. It was the second time, when he came to pick up Vlad to go for lunch, that he directly asked me how I was.

Last night I texted Sonny and I shared with her my worries about this moment. She told me not to lie to him.

He already knows I am bipolar. I told him I was sick. He hasn't seen me lately in the office in person—yesterday I connected to Daniel's talk with messy hair and a t-shirt. He must have an idea of what is going on.

I received an e-mail from the Wellness Hub letting me know they tried to contact me to schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr Perera and asking me to call them myself on their available hours. I checked my phone and I did have a missed call that was blocked by my automatic do not disturb mode. When I read the e-mail the window of unavailability was just starting. I decided I can call them tomorrow.

I had enough work to show Louis in our meeting. He didn't ask me again how I was doing, so we talked about the two pending resubmission of my articles. He worked right there on the cover letter for Brain and sent it to my e-mail. I talked about the results I had just gotten and figured out how to move forward with my modeling of the PET data. As I was talking to him, he got a call from what I assume was his wife. He spoke in French, but I understood everything he said. There had been an issue with his aunt and it might be required to take her back to the hospital.

I shared with Alda my plans of coming, but she wasn't feeling very well. I left the office around 17h. I took the 80 bus and walked to here. There are terraces already and most of them were full. The one in here was as well, but I actually preferred staying in doors for now. The hostess received me and, after confirming I was by myself, she asked me if I preferred a table or the bar. I told her I had no preference, but when she guided me to the bar I realized that I would feel uncomfortable with my laptop there, so I changed my mind. There were plenty of tables to seat me.

Now, even the bar is full.

### Tuesday, May 21st, 2024

"Bonjour. Je me retrouve maintenant dans un épisode dépressif; mes médicaments ne fonctionnent plus correctement. Je ne pourrai pas assister au cours aujourd’hui; j’ignore si demain non plus. Je ne verrai pas mon psychiatre jusqu’à jeudi. Je suis très désolée pour mon/mes absence(s)."

I lost another weekend. It was a long one.

I did not work on Friday, but I did do something. I had invited Alda to join me the day before on Dieu du ciel! At noon, she texted me inquiring if I wanted to get a coffee or a beer that day. I was sitting on this same couch, not watching anything in particular on the television. I told her I would need to shower, but that I was free. We agreed to go out in the early evening. She said she'd do some research since she wanted to go some place new.

Later she sent me a link to Café Olimpico. I remembered the time we went to one of the places of café olimpico. The place seemed small and the coffee was mediocre. There were a group of Spanish people on the table close to us. I didn't want to waste my energy going to a place where we wouldn't probably find a place to sit.

She added that we could also go to Old Port. Old port could have worked for me, since I would only need to take the orange line. She wanted to go to a terrace. She then sent the time schedules for cinéma du parc. I confessed that I didn't have the mental energy to focus on a 2h movie. She sent me the links for two places around Old Port. They seemed expensive without anything to warrant the high price.

Lastly, she suggested Next door. I didn't recognize the name. She later reminded me of Mandy. While it was also just the orange line, getting there would take me a full hour and she didn't even like the place some of the last times we went.

We settled on going to a terrace in Mile End. We could try SIboire's. We agreed to leave early in order to be able to get a spot.

I got there before her. There were plenty of seats on the terrace. I sat down and told the waitress if she had a problem if I waited for my friend to order despite she would take another 15 or 20 minutes. In the end, I did order and Alda arrived just as the waitress brought me my pint.

We stayed there for around two hours just chatting and being together. I didn't feel as drunk as the evening before.

I haven't been outside since.

The next day Aliza texted me to ask me how I was doing. Ups and downs. I told her about meeting with Alda the day before and then returned the questions. She told me she was alright and asked me if  I wanted to get a beer sometime later.

"Ow, si quiero, pero creo que no tengo suficiente energía."

She reassured me that it was OK, and said we would meet later this week at QBIN's event in Concordia.

The event is Thursday, the same day I have the appointment with Dr Franck to let him know that, while the meds did improve my mental well-being for a bit, I am back to losing complete days unable to get myself out of bed.

I promised Fabiola that I would go outside, take a little walk and let myself be touched by the Sun. I let her down. Tomorrow I'll do my best to go to the office.

Monday was a free day. I wanted to finish the resubmission of the Qrater paper since the deadline is approaching. I did nothing except cooking myself dinner.

I showered, finally, this morning, before my session with Fabiola. My hair was still wet. I looked thicker and meatier on the half of the screen showing my face. I hated myself and my appearance. I haven't eaten anything all day and I feel tempted to continue the fast indefinitely. I probably won't.

Before my shower I brewed myself coffee and I called the Wellness Hub to schedule the appointment with Dr Perera. I waited around 15 minutes before someone picked up the phone. They schedule the call to next Thursday's afternoon. She first offered me 15h15, but I realized I'd be finishing my meeting with Louis around that time. I asked her for an earlier or later time and we settled on 15h45.

Right now I should be on French class. I said that I wasn't sure if I was going to skip tomorrow's class, as well. I honestly don't know if I will continue at all.

### Thursday, May 23rd, 2024

I think that I like TV shows. When I think about that stuff, it feels like someone took a shovel and dug out all my insides and I know there’s nothing in there. But I’m still too nervous to open myself up and check. I know there’s something wrong with me.

— Owen, I saw the TV glow.

Two nights ago, an hour past midnight, I reached out to Alda quoting an old text of hers linking the showings at Cinema du Parc with a proposition to watch a movie.

"Let's go watch I saw the TV glow."

Yesterday I did not wake up early, but I did go to the office. I had enough time to pass by the bakery and the intentions of doing it. I walked past the first door of the metro station, but changed my mind and got inside using the second one.

The office was empty when I got in. It remained empty up to when I left.

I saw Louis' e-mail saying he was going to work from home. He later sent me a direct e-mail to reschedule our meeting today because of Daniel's defense. He P.S.ed his email saying that the funding paragraph was a work-in-progress. Instead of meeting that afternoon, I chose his option for Monday and told him about my plans for going to the QBIN thing in Concordia today.

Alda replied to my text and we planned to watch the movie that same day. I told her I had texted my French professor about not connecting to class. I told her I wasn't feeling like working so we could do something before the movie. She said we could go to a café and study. Had I brought my laptop with me I would have accepted right away. Instead I told her we could just go see the movie in the evening.

Our office neighbor came to visit me and brought me a post-it with a website written on it. It was the site of a couple of photographers. He did some street photography; her besides photography, was also a writer. I was distracted by this later finding that I didn't looked into their pictures. The post-it remains stuck to the bottom of my monitor.

Around four hours after my last message I asked Alda if she had gone to a café after all. I was hungry and thought I would rather have some company than continuing working alone. I thought about going to Aunja, but the idea didn't fully convinced me. I tried to think of a place that were close and preferably to have some terrace. I remembered Santropol. Alda liked my idea. She said we could meet there at 17h. I told her I would probably go there a bit earlier and I had no problem waiting for her.

My plan was to leave at 16h, but I got too much into my own work. At 16h20, Alda said she'd be leaving soon. I grabbed my stuff and walked by the stadium.

When I got to the café, I waited on the entrance by the sign asking me to wait to be seated. There was a person there, but he was busy with some people. When they left, two other women came to him. Finally, he looked at me and asked me how I was doing. I asked for a table at the terrace and told him we would be two people. He guided me outside and left two menus on the table.

I was unbothered for a significant portion of the time I waited for Alda. I was reading the book that Sophie recommended me once when the waiter finally came.

"Je attends mon amie, mais je peux commencer avec un chaï maison glacé."

Not much after the waiter came with my drink did Alda arrive.

She got herself an americano and we considered both the idea of getting some food.

We were sitting in our table deep in our chat when suddenly it started rainning. The water was as aggresive as it was sudden. Almost as quick, we grabbed our glasses and moved to another table guarded from the rain. Some other people decided to move inside. The waiter and waitresses rushed to pick up the cushions from some of the chairs.

We continued our conversation. We remembered how the last time we had been there it was with Nico. I realized that we had been at the terrace as well, so it must have been during summer, which meant it must have been last year.

The first time I had been at that terrace was around three years ago. It was my very first time going out on a date. I looked towards the table were I was seaten and remembered how I had the mexican salad and a conversation with a Parisian computer scientist who had a tattoo of a can of maple syrup in her arm.

Alda and I finished our drinks. When the waitress passed by, I stopped her to ask her for a menu. She didn't understand me the first time and I repeated myself. She brought us an English menu.

Alda got herself a salad and a hibiscus lemonade. I ordered a bowl of gazpacho instead of the chilli.

The soup was not as good as I expected, but it was cheaper than the other option.

We asked for our bills with enough time to walk to La cité, get to metro and buy a can of shape before the movie.

There was a lady by the entrance that asked us if we already had tickets. When I responded that we didn't she guided us towards the line of people some steps ahead. There was a made-up checkout-counter with a fridge and a small bookcase with some candy and bags of popcorn.

We got inside the theater while the previews were showing.

I could write about the movie. How the tension hit too close to home and the ending left me speechless. I was expecting something but the credits came out instead. Alda stood up and I let her pass. I remained seated and read the name of the actors and the musicians, trying to figure out how I was feeling.

When I got out, I didn't see Alda. Despite the apparent work that was going on on the movie theater the restrooms were open. I went in before trying to look for Alda. I got into the corridor of closed doors; I saw and passed a couple of open rooms with urinals inside. I don't remember the list time that I used one. When I got out of the room with a toilette that I had picked, there was a line formed by the sinks.

I washed my hands. I went to dry them when I saw Alda coming out from there.

We walked upstairs together. There were a group of people conglomerated by the entrance. Apparently it was raining. More and more people came upstairs and remained in the small lobby.

"When we went to see Love Lies Bleeding the theatre was full of lesbians; this time it was full of trans people." I would text Alda an hour later when I had made it home.

If you see a trans people, no you didn't. Someone once wrote on Reddit.

Did they recognized me, too?

One of them was crying when she climbed the stairs.

After a couple of minutes, people started leaving. Alda and I were tempted to go inside the dive bar that I went with Valerie after seeing Everything everywhere all at once. Instead we went out. Alda would wait for the 144 bus that was supposed to pass in 6 minutes and I could walk towards station Sherbrooke.

After my text, we continued talking about the movie.

"I didn't realize gender dysmorphia was one of the themes until I read this," sent me Alda with a link.

I thought about correcting her—dysphoria, you mean; dysmorphia is when I think I'm fat, dysphoria is when I think I look like a man—, but swallowed my thoughts instead.

I considered getting some burgers for dinner. I cooked a burrito.

I felt nervous about taking Dr Franck's call in Concordia, even more about missing it. I went to bed wearing this anxiety as pijamas.

At 4h50, I texted Aliza my resolution of not going.

I was in pijamas, sitting on my desk, when I confessed to Dr Franck, that I felt confused and frustrated with my recent ups and downs. He nodded understandingly and offered me to change medications.

He'll start me with 50 mg of seroquel. I'm supposed to wait a week before taking them. Depending how I feel during this week, I can even not take them at all. My next appointment with Dr Franck is in two weeks when we'll pick it up from there.

They called me from the pharmacy in the evening to let me know they had received the prescription. I told them I could pass tomorrow and pick the new meds up together with my hormones.

### Monday, May 27th, 2024

"Almost like the turkish: dark as hell, strong as death, and sweet as love, except I take it bitter, like my dating life."

Did I miss another weekend?

It definitely was not empty.

Friday, I picked up the meds and got some groceries on the walk back.

I kept thinking about the experiences I read on the bipolar subreddit. The pharmacist, after asking me for the reason that I had stopped taking Lurasidone, warned me about the somnolence and weight gain that come up with these meds.

I had the two large clementines that I bought at Tsikinis. I decided that I should get used to hunger and decided that the pair of fruits would be my only meal for the day.

The next morning, I was still in bed, when in a group chat, Alda, Veronica and I were deciding which terrasse to go to see the sunset. Veronica had sent some propositions at around 3h. I told her shortly after that they looked kind of expensive to me, but I could just have one cocktail. In the morning, Alda picked it up and shared with us her research of the not-so-expensive ones with their menus and prices.

When we tried to make a reservation on their websites, they only had times available in the early afternoon. Veronica called them directly on the phone and got us a reservation at Terrasse Place d'armes.

I was the first one to arrive, and went to the plaza in front of the basilique to wait. I saw Alda arrive and she sat with me on the bench for a brief moment before we both went up the hotel. Vero was already sitting at the table.

We all got a cocktail called Dragon mule; Vero and Alda shared a 45 CAD plate of chicken.

Vero told us of the party of a friend of a friend to which she was invited. She had asked her friend if we could also go. We were not very convinced, but we didn't tell her no.

We went to Brewsky to kill time and let Vero's friend to arrive first at the party. I was tempted to getting a plate of fries, but instead I got myself only a glass of IPA.

Despite arriving at 22h, we got to the party much earlier than Vero's friend. We were interrogated by two women at the entrance who begrudgingly let us in and guided is to an available table. As we walked towards the restroom and I glanced at the people sitting on the different tables, I realized that Alda and I were both severely under-dressed and the only non-african people in the room.

The toilets didn't flush. We all finished washing our hands, but decided to remain inside the restroom until the person in the stage finished with his speech.

As we were walking to our improvisedly assigned table, everyone echoed Amen to the front guy's speech.

One of the same women that let us in offered us something to drink. Vero asked for a rhum and coke, but they told her they had only water, juices and beer. All three of us asked for water. Later, when Vero and Alda went to get some food, people asked them why we were only drinking water.

I decided not to eat anything.

We left the party shortly after Vero's friend arrived around 23h45.

I could hardly sleep. I felt sick from my 36h fast. Despite getting in bed at around 1h, I got up three hours later. I cooked myself breakfast and brewed some coffee. I slept better on my second try when I returned to bed a couple of hours before noon.

In the afternoon I went to Aliza's to do our taxes and watch Mexico's soccer final match with Walter.

I asked Aliza if she would mind if I didn't shower.

"WTF with that question."

I made a stop at metro and bought a box of apple pastries, a four pack of ciders and a plastic cup of donut holes. I started nibbling on the cinnamon pastries during the rest of my walk.

I finished my taxes.

I did eat some of the pizza that we ordered.

This morning I remained in bed after cancelling my alarms. I read Louis' e-mail that he was going to work from home and decided to stay here.

Aliza sent me a poster of a Bipolar study at the Douglas and I sent them an e-mail asking for information. Someone did get back to me in Spanish asking me if they could call me in the afternoon after 15h.

I had my meeting with Louis at 15h. We agreed for a zoom videchat at 16h30. I feared about having to come out to her as trans and the implications that that might have with the study.

In the end, I didn't tell her. She told me that she was part of a different study that pretends to explore the efficacity of Brexpiprazole treating treatment-resistant bipolar depression. While an inclusion criteria is indeed being treated at the Douglas, there might be a possibility of being seen by one of their psychiatrists together with Dr Franck. She told me to continue with the current plan of starting Seroquel and, if that doesn't work, to reach out to her to explore the possibility of enrolling in the trial.

Yesterday, when I redownloaded the apps to see if I had any new matches, I saw a new conversation appear in Hinge. She matched me from a text I sent her on the 8th of May. I texted her this morning, but she hasn't replied.

I reached out to a new girl. She matched with me a couple of hours ago, replying flirtily to my answer of how I drink my question by suggesting she was about to make my coffee as sweet as 5 sugars and 3 creams.

In our last messages, I told her I was reading Honey Girl, after craving some lesbian romance.

"I could fill in for the lesbian romance," she replied.

I thought back to a couple of hours before, after sending an e-mail to Éric and the French class that I was abandoning the course, when I was browsing reddit and someone made a post looking for validation asking if having a penis would be a deal-breaker for the members of the actuallesbian subreddit. Around half of the members of that subreddit are trans women. I was expecting to roll my eyes at the wave of patronizing comments telling OP how she was desirable as a lesbian. I was dissapointingly surprised by the vast majority confessing that it would definitely be an incompatibility. As I read more and more people using different words to say while it definitely wouldn't be me, you sure will find someone, I recognized the old familiar face of dysphoria.

"What about you? What have you been craving?" I texted the new girl, contradicting both my intention of not using these apps anymore and my recently awoken feelings of undesirability.

I finally did laundry today. They have repaired the machines in the building. I went to the dépanneur and asked the cashier to exchange me a toony for two loonies. Sometime this week, I'll walk to the buanderette to change the close to 40 CADs of toonies.

"Sophia, je viens de savoir que tu as arrêté le cours. J'espère que tu ailles meilleur," texted me Anita 15 minutes after the class started.

"How 'bout I take you for lunch and I give you the best head rubs?"

I haven't been sleeping very well.

Two nights ago I didn't sleep at all. I gave up around 5h and got up to shower and start the day. I felt drained around 10h and had to go back to bed and try to sleep a little before my session with Fabiola. I can't remember if I slept again in the afternoon, but at night I had trouble again falling asleep.

Yesterday I tried going to the lab. I got up as early as my lack of rest would let me. I got out and walked to the bakery for breakfast. I passed the turnstiles at the metro station and was walking down the platform when the electric voice announced that there was a service interruption that would last until some minutes after noon. In my phone, I saw a bus would be passing soon by Parc Jarry that would let me on the intersection Pins and Parc. I walked there and waited with the group of people for around 5 minutes. When the bus finally came, as it got closer and closer I could notice that it was completely full. The bus didn't brake and continously drove dismissing us.

I walked back home and actually worked for a change.

At 5h, Pam asked me out.

"How could anyone say no to that?" I replied after coming back home from my odyssey.

At around 14h she asked me about my job and my schedule. I haven't heard back from her after I answered.

I don't remember if it was yesterday or the day before, but I found out I have been losing weight again. I am down back to 78kg. I told Fabiola when I talked about my fasting weekend how stopped eating was a way of trying to get used to the sensations of being hungry. Both yesterday and today I have eaten breakfast and dinner. As I am finishing this paragraph, I am eating chips from the bag I just bought from the dépanneur 15 minutes ago.

Today I went to the lab again. I had my meeting with Louis earlier than usual, at 10h. Again, I could not fall asleep until past 3h. To be fair, I also haven't been taking the sleeping pills. Twice I've considered it, but hesitated thinking that by the time I had remembered about their existence I no longer had 7 more hours to spend in bed.

The alarm started rumbling at 7h45. Despite having passed around 4h, I felt there had passed only a brief moment since closing my eyes. I stayed another 15 minutes bargaining with the sunlight for another taste of rest.

I had enough time to make a stop at the bakery and catch the 144 bus on time. Instead of turning right, it went left. I confirmed on my phone that it wouldn't be able to leave me on my usual stop. The detour wasn't too disrupting. I got off in front of Hôpital Victoria. I walked to my office, sent to Louis the slides that I finished the night before, and ate my croissant calmly sipping my coffee and listening to my music.

After talking about my research, Louis decided that it would be necessary to consult with Pedro and Joseph how to move forward. He sent the e-mail asking for their availabilities. I felt on my shoulders the hesitance born from the fact that Pedro doesn't like my project at all. In his eyes, I am not exploring anything that is not well known already. My research question to him seems redundant, derivative, and inconsequential.

Someone from Aperture Neuro sent me an e-mail asking for the Supplementary material document that I seemed to have forgotten to submit. Less than an hour after I sent it to him, I got a notification from Mallar that the article had been accepted for publication. I need to send the final documents to the typesetter. I'll probably do it tomorrow morning.

I had my appointment with Dr Perera on the hallway in front of the football field. She asked me if I had any symptoms of UTI, given high values of something on my urine analyses. My oestrogen levels also seemed a bit higher than normal. I thought back to the injection that I had to give myself and the doubts that, rather than the pharmacy mistakenly giving me fewer pills, I had been taking two blue pills in the mornings instead of one.

I came back to pick up my stuff and started my return home. I walked to station Sherbrooke, holding back tears for some unknown reason. On the platform, I saw the train arrive full of people and continued walking by the open doors as the green lights turned red, the doors closed, and the metro started moving again. I sat down on one of the chairs by the end. I relaxed my neck letting my head fall down, as my sight met the floor the tears formed out and rolled down my cheeks.

Tonight I take the first pill of Seroquel.

### Sunday, June 2nd, 2024

"Sofía, have you ever been in a toxic relationship?"

"In my relationships, I've been the toxic one."

The new pills have made me sleep. Practically, I've been sleeping the whole weekend.

Thursday I took the first dose and went to bed at around 22h. I didn't wake up until 14h. I stayed home and did not go to the office. I can't remember if I did any work.

I did. I finished the submission for the HVR paper. Probably next week we'll get the notification that it was rejected by the editors for not being novel enough; because I am not good enough.

I had told Aliza and Walter that I was going to skip out the plans of going to the coffee expo. I realized that spending around 30 dollars to be offered the opportunity to spend even more money buying coffee that I would let go stale was not financially reasonable, specially when my checking account didn't have enough funds for the upcoming rent cheque.

Aliza offered me to lend me the money for the entrance if I was really interested. I thought that it would be a good experience so I hesitated about changing my mind. I tried buying the entrance tickets a couple of days before, but the only option for a single day entrance had vendredi on its name. I thought that I could just buy mine at the door.

After my long nights, I warned them both that I would do my best to get out of bed, but I might not be able to make it.

I woke up before the alarm that I had set with ample time to shower and get to the SAT by noon. It still was impossible for me to gather the will to move. I closed my eyes again and continued sleeping until 13h.

I texted with Aliza and we agreed that I could meet with them after the expo and grab something to eat.

I made a stop at McDonald's in Place des arts and got myself a large iced coffee. I sat down on a chair by l'esplanade tranquille. I sent my location to Aliza before I closed my eyes and got lost in the music playing from my iPod.

Besides Walter and his girlfriend, Aliza was with two other women. The blonde one was german, the brunette was María José; she was from Costa Rica.

We ate at Pizzeria N° 9000.

Afterwards, they went for a cone of ice cream and I got myself a second coffee.

Illiana—was that her name?—left before they made their stop at the ice cream place.

We wandered a bit around the are while they ate.

The original plan was to go to Aliza's house and start our rewatch of House of the Dragon. Walter and Seunghwa remained seated in the metro when the rest of us got off at De L'Eglise. Seunghwa had a long shift the next day, so they went home.

At Aliza's couch we talked and talked. The internet was not working so we got distracted by gossip and drama about past relationships. When the internet finally worked and the the intro of the TV show was set and ready to be played, we continued our sharing of stories. We spent the whole evening drowned in conversations.

Time passed us by. At around 22h, I started checking the prices of Uber instead of the next departure of the 108 bus. I didn't mind spending some money if that meant getting to my house earlier. The night before I had been reading about the bad experiences of people skipping a dose of Seroquel. They talked about nause and vomiting. How most of them had only skipped a dose once.

When I was ready to leave, the prices of Uber almoust doubled. I decided to catch the next 108 bus that was coming in the next 5 minutes. I said my good-byes, left the building and walked towards the stop. I almost missed the bus, but the driver marked the lights and slowly stopped for me after the intersection.

I made it home a handful of minutes past 1h. The first thing I did after taking my shoes off was going into my bedroom and swallowing the pill.

I had troubles falling asleep. Since the bus I had a mild headache and my stomach felt uneasy. My legs were throbbing. I did not feel the somnolence that 20 minutes ago when I took today's pill made me consider going to bed and leaving the narration of the day incomplete. At around 2h30, I went to the restroom and took an Advil. When it kicked in around half an hour after, I could finally sleep.

Today I got up around noon. The day was empty and unmotivated.

"So, I assume no head rubs, then" I double-texted Pam, unsure of what I expected to get out of i

 ¿Me vas a dejar irme otra vez sin besarme?

I'm somewhere around 30 thousand feet over Durango. After spending a week in Mexico City, I am now traveling to Tijuana. My parents are going to be waiting for me at the airport. They will drive me home where Nymi will be waiting for me.

The whole week I've been meaning to sit down and write. I don't remember the last thing I wrote about nor what has happened since.

A lot has happened this week. I don't know really from where to start.

I landed on Mexico City last Friday, on the 21st. I stepped outside the airport and waited for Sonny's car to come to the roundabout. Sonny and Paty were inside; they were coming from a soccer match. We were to a Taco place close to Paty's place. I took a picture of my dinner and posted it as a story on Instagram. I wanted Alda and the rest of people that I knew from Montréal to get a glimpse of my experience here. I also wanted Paty to indirectly know that I had arrived.

I had a only a vague idea of what my next week would be. Cris had asked me to keep open my evening for Saturday. I offered Paty to do the same and she picked Sunday and Monday.

We met with Cris and her guy friend at La Casa de Toño. I was wearing the brown cargo pants that I bought from Sonny, the white Muse t-shirt and a red and black striped bra underneath. I put on contacts and was even wearing make up. Sonny invited Luis, a friend of hers that we had met with before on Zona Rosa many years before. He didn't come until much later into the night. Liz and her boyfriend joined us after Sonny and I were finishing our half-shared meal.

We went to only one bar the whole night. It was the same bar we had come five years ago on the night before I flought to the US. We decided to get a table upstairs by buying a bottle of liquor. We grabbed chairs for our table and chose tequile as our drink for the night. The waitress brought us what would be our first of three bottles.

I felt drunker than how I remembered I ever been. Once, I slipped off with the excuse of going to the table and went downstairs to see the people dancing, the women that had also decided to come to this bar. Earlier that day it had been La marcha lencha; I saw people posting stuff about it. Mar and some of other Sonny's friends texted her to reprimand her about skipping. When I chose my flights, going there was part of the reason why I chose these specific dates. Sonny had told me that she didn't feel it was her thing, but could go with me if I really wanted to attend. I can't remember why I decided to skip it.

Later into the night, between our second and third bottle, Luis, Sonny, and I decided to go downstairs and dance within the mass of people. A coupld of days later I would tell Fabiola during our first in-person session how I felt like the most attractive woman of the whole bar.

I almost kissed Cris. I would've, I think, but Sonny got in the middle of us.

I texted with Paty about the details of our meeting tomorrow. She asked me to go to Chapultepec at around noon. I confirmed that she meant the forest and confessed that I was already a bit too drunk. She wished me to enjoy my night and I did my best to do just that.

At around 2h, Sonny, Louis, his sister, and I left the bar to get some hot dogs that were apparently very good. It was raining. Despite trying to walk under the half-roofs of the buildings, we were soaking wet by the time we got into Luis' car and got a ride to his apartment so we could order our Uber there. Drivers kept cancelling on us. I wanted to pee really bad and would probably not be able to hold it the hour-long ride to Sonny's. Luis invited us to go at his place and then try again with Uber later.

We ended up arriving at Sonny's house at 4h45. Despite being surprised by my unfamiliar confidence in the dance floor, I decided to skip my antipsychotics. The excuse that I gave myself was that the medication would make it harder to get up just a couple of hours later that I would need to to meet with Paty.

Sunday, I wore the same pair of jeans I wore a couple of days before when I landed on Mexico City and that I am wearing right now as I am typing this words and sipping on an almost finished can of Amstel Ultra. I wore the white tank top with the white and black striped bra underneath, almost showing. I wore no make up but I can't remember exactly why.

Paty changed the plan and we then were supposed to meet at the Insurgentes roundabout. I got myself an Uber and arrived earlier than our agreed time. I was still a bit hungover when I was sitting outside the closed metro station waiting for Paty's arrival.

She saw me before I did her. She hugged me for longer than I would have expected and made a comment about how long it had been since the last time we saw each other, as if she had perceived my earlier thoughts. We started walking towards the exit of the roundabout and she grabbed my hand.

We held hands as we approached the same area that I had been there just a couple of hours earlier.

First, we got to a korean place where we had Ramen and dumplings. We ate and talked. After what now feels like hours, I asked for the bill. I payed. She told me that she had been the one who invited me, but I insisted. We walked a bit around Zona Rosa. She suggested that we could buy me a mojito.

We got to a nameless bar and sat ourselves on a table under just a carp despite the threat of rain. We each ordered a litter of mojito and continue with our conversation. I would sometimes take any excuse to reach out and grab her arm or brush her thigh with my knee.

The rain roared around us without disturbing.

She paid this time.

We left during one of the brief moments when the rain had calmed down. We walked just a bit before we took cover inside a plaza nearby. We sat down in the food court without buying anything. I would get closer to her and get drunk with her closeness.

We talked about other women, both hers and mine. After having been more than eight hours together, she subtly suggested to go walk outside as a way to put an end to our day.

We didn't get too far before I took her hint and started ordering my Uber back to Sonny's.

She bought me a mug. I had asked her to hold on to it for me. Both of us suspected that I would later forget to ask for it back, but I didn't. I was holding it on one hand and my phone on the other as we followed my driver getting closer to our pick-up point. She was standing next to me with her head resting on my shoulder as she looked towards my phone.

The white van stopped in front of us. It's doors opened automatically and I climbed inside.   Le petit morceau de coeur qui me manquait

I could not stay awake for the rest of the flight.

I landed on Tijuana not long after midnight. My parents picked me up from the airport and Nymeria was awake to receive me.

I spent most of yesterday sleeping, as if I were tired from the long week in Mexico City that I haven't finished to narrate.

I was supposed to see Paty Monday, as well, but she could not get the day off. On my Uber back to Sonny's, I replied to the text from Aliza's mom and scheduled a meeting the next day to pick up Aliza's medicines from an apartment in La Narvarte.

Monday evening we did just that. I took my camera, but did not take many pictures. This time we did use the public transport. It was my first time riding the cablebus. Our intention was to go to Hop and stay there, one metro station away from the apartment of Aliza's aunt. From where the bus left us to the bar, we made a stop in a shoe store. I can't remember if that was the first day when I borrowed Sonny's father's shoes. It might have been the first time that I started being misgendered despite not wearing overly masculine clothes. I liked a couple of pairs of shoes in there, but they didn't carry my size. After that, we stoped at a pants store. Sonny like the style and colour that the mannequin was wearing.

"Son de hombre," the salesman started before he corrected himself as he realized he was talking himself out of making a sale, "bueno, son unisex."

Sonny tried them on first. We both liked them, so I went inside the small room covered by a red curtain and put them on, as well.

We ended up buying two similar pairs, and I bought a third one in a different colour.

We got to the bar and we were welcomed as women. We ordered a flyer of beers to try out the different beers. When we figured out which one we liked best, we got ourselves a pint and a glass respectively of our favourites. For food, we good a cup of fries, an order of chicken wings, and two single wings with their hottest sauce made from Habanero, Ghost Pepper and Carolina Reaper.

They made us sign a waiver form before bringing us our spicy chicken. I was the first one to try it out. I started by deboning the wing, and then put the whole piece of red meat in my mouth. I tasted flames on my tongue all the way to the start of my throat. I sweated and eyes teared. A sense of urgence and danger was taking form in my chest. I drank water, but it did not dissipate. I remindede myself that it was temporary as I kept rinsing the fire of my throat with the cold water.

"No te la comas." I warned Sonny. She did not listen.

I have a video recording of the desperation in Sonny's face as she kept chugging water.

She did not finish the whole wing.

The hot effect of the wings started to fade around 15 to 20 minutes after we had them. We continued drinking our beers until I got the text from Aliza's mom letting me know she had come back home from her lunch with her sister and was ready to receive me.

I used Sonny's metro card and rode the metrobus for two stations. I got off close to the metro station that I would frequently take every other Sunday when I would go to meet with the people from Yaaj at Ivan's house. I walked the same diagonal street, but took a premature left turn for the appartment that Aliza would live in some years ago during the pandemic.

The doorman asked me for my destination and called in to see if they were expecting me. Aliza´s mom invited me in to sit at their table. We talked about Aliza and her family, their history with thyroid´s issues as a context for the medications that I would fly with me back to Montréal. There was a plastic bag holding two large bags of chips as a reward for my favour. Aliza's aunts filled up a prescription under my name to ease any potential issue that might arise at customs. After around 15 minutes of smalltalk and thanks, I was back on my way to the bar.

This time I took the metro rather than the metrobus. Walking down the stairs inside the metro station, I started feeling a discomfort in my upper stomach. It would mildly come and go.

I forgot to text Sonny as I approached her. I took the wrong turn exiting the metro station and had to turn back. She texted me asking my whereabouts and letting me know she was feeling a bit sick, but I missed her texts of solidarity.

I noticed the second pint she had ordered herself as I approached our table. The glass was almost full. I tried to help her, but I didn't feel like drinking any more.

We stayed a bit more in the bar; I can't remember if we were just trying to finish the cold glass of beer or if we were also waiting for the rain to calm down.

The stomach aches kept returning, getting stronger with each wave. Sonny looked for a pharmacy and went there looking for an antiacid or something to aliviate our pain.

After paying our bill, Sonny felt like sharing our story with the waitress. She told her about her initial intention of sharing a single hot wing between the two of us and how I rejected her idea as I wanted a full one to myself.

I then added to the story how after the effects of the wing had passed, I took upon myself to finish the second half of Sonny's, as I didn't want any food to be thrown away. I made no comment about how the second hit of spiciness was even worse than the first one.

We ordered an Uber to Sonny's house and waited for it by the entrance of the bar.

The stomach aches returned with fury. I could barely sleep for the night. I would remain immobile on Sonny's bed with the hopes that by staying still, the pains would not come back. They always did. At around maybe 4h or 5h, I could finally fall asleep.

There was a mixup with the dates. My appointment with Mar was for Wednesday 26th, rather than Tuesday.

Tuesday we stayed home for most of the day, except for a small trip to the Pulquería close to Sonny's. We were the only clients there. We got ourselves half a litter of curado de avena each. Sonny asked the person if they had food still, and he said it would come soon. I expected a plate of chips or nuts, or some other type of snack, but what came instead were two plates of hot chicken soup with rice and vegetables. John Wick was playing on the television. We ordered a second glass of pulque which we finished around the same time as the movie ended.

By mar's instructions, I had to have a hearty breakfast and be well-hydrated for our appointment Wednesday's afternoon. Sonny prepared eggs with longaniza and brewed coffee that I drank on my new pink mug. We also used the metro from Constitución de 1917 to Nativitas in the blue line. I was wearing the new mustard-coloured man pants and a dark red tank top. As other days, I felt insecured about riding the front train and being seen as a male.

We were greeted by Mar and her dog Bohemia. We accepted the offer for a glass of water and drank them downstairs between smalltalk. We climbed the stairs and Mar asked us to take off our shoes before entering her studio. I welcomed the offer as I still hadn't gotten used to wearing normal shoes. Sonny later would confess that she feels uncomfortable when asked to remove her shoes unexpectedly.

I took a couple of pictures of the place while Mar finished with the designs. The night before, when Sonny and I were watching All of us strangers on her living room, Mar sent us the proposed designs. They were even better than what I was expecting. Now, going back through my memories, I can't recall if she put on both stencils before starting tatooing my arm. It must have been that way, since it makes no sense that she would take off her gloves just to put them back on again after positioning the phoenix on my shoulder.

She asked me with which one I wanted to start; I chose the smaller one on my forearm.

The pain was louder and sharper than what I remembered. I did not grimace nor grunt; I probably gave no sign of it, despite worrying that the second, larger one on my back would be unbearable.

Not even 15 minutes after the needle first pierced my skin was the small leafed branch finished.

The plant-tailed bird on my back was born with less pain than I was expecting. The needle's screeches were manageable, only until the very end with the last branch of the phoenix's tail did I start having trouble holding down the pain. A small red aura surrounded the very last leaf, as gentle moan from my hurt skin.

Sonny scheduled getting together with Paty and Cris to get some coffee somewhere close to downtown. After catching up with Mar's italian ex early in the day, she also invited her to join us.

When we were finished with Mar, Sonny was barely containing her hunger. We decided to look for some place to eat nearby and settled on a place that we missed in the map. I got myself a choripan and Sonny ordered a beef pepito. Both of us had beers with our food.

After eating, we rode the metro all the way to Revolución station. We walked towards the café that Cris had proposed in the chat. Paty and Cris were together by the entrance of the closed place. Sonny had seen there was another one very close by. We got there and ordered a table for 5 people.

Monica, the 5th missing person, arrived before the waitress approached us to take our order. I pointed out how several of the house drinks had cheese in them. I ordered myself an horchata drink instead.

"Ay, pensé que habías dicho mi nombre," the waitress subtly addressed Monica. We all noticed how later through the night, she would get nervous around her. I got on with the joke, but was never sure myself if the special attention was not something just on our eyes.

After our initial drinks, all of us-except Cris, who went with an irish coffee-ordered a carajillo to finish the night.

I paid our bill with my credit card.

We all posed in front of the monument to the revolution for a picture that I later shared on Instragram.

Monica was the first to separate from the group. We all took the metrobus to Buenavista where Cris was the second to split. Paty, Sonny, and I rode the complete green line to Constitución. It was too late to take the cablebús and we didn't have enought battery to order an Uber, so I pushed Sonny to get ourselves a taxi instead.

Early in the week, I sent a message to Fabiola asking her to move our session later to the evening so I wouldn't have to look for a place in Coyoacán to have my call with Louis right before. My plan was to wake up early in the morning and ask Louis to move our meeting earlier, to free up my afternoon and have more time to wander around the city. I woke up to an e-mail from him asking me if I wanted to meet, and letting me know he had some available time slots earlier in the morning.

I showered and went to the Oxxo to get myself and Sonny some coffee, since we had run out.

Paty texted me on Instagram confused about the response from Bertha, the girl she liked but had a girlfriend. She shared, too, another comment from a woman she referred as the single mother. I told her I thought Bertha had indeed broken up with her girlfriend and was interested her. I suggested to post pictures with me to make her jealous. Mañana, she replied. She finished our exchange with a short audioclip letting me know that she would not be able to skip work the next day, but would ask to get out early, around 13h or 14h, so we could eat something good.

On our meeting by Teams, Louis made a comment about the picture of Marianela's quinceañera. We talked about the poster, the payment for the Qrater paper, and the findings that I got expanding the initial HVR analyses. When we finished I went to wake up Sonny. I don't remember if we had breakfast at home again, or if we went somewhere to eat. I recall looking through the maps for the options nearby Doncelesand feeling overwhelmed.

We used the metro again and got off at Bellas Artes, the sky was gray with the threat of rain. We went to a place which name I have already forgotten. We sat close to the balcony, but still inside. I was wearing the blue grayish man pants with the loose Muse t-shirt that failed to cover up the borders of my red bra. With my black jacket covering the openings around my arms that showed the only signs of femininety from my outfit, my appearance was overly masculine.

Sonny ordered several tacos with different fillings. I got myself a taco of cochinita and a torta of pollo con mole. Both of us had a pint of beer with our food.

We left the place and walked towards the street with all of the photography stores. It started rainning, but not as aggresively as other days before. Some of the vendors welcomed me to ask questions or show me their products with a male joven.

I bought nothing, despite finding some half-frame cameras like I've been meaning to get. The prices were much higher than what I was expecting.

Was I disheartened by the constant misgendering throughout the day?

During my whole stay in Mexico City, I never felt as vulnerable passing through the gates where the police guard the entrance to the first train as I did that afternoon when we went from Bellas Artes to Coyoacán.

We borrowed the Coffee Passport from Cris and Paty the night before. We ended up going to Kahwen, a café nearby Fabiola's office. The place was small and intimate. A bunch of tables with chairs were placed in front of the café, by the sidewalk. Inside, it was nothing more than a room with a long bar by the backhouse where the espresso machine and the large italian grinder were.

I took off my jacket and placed it on the coat hanger behind the stool together with my small red backpack. Sonny sat down across the bar in front of me. She ordered a red house drink made of fruit and cold brew. I got myself a boring flat white. We had around two hours to spend before my appointment just a couple of streets away.

We were the only people inside the café. Besides the barista there was another man, who I thought was the barista's boyfriend. Sonny disagreed.

On the second hour, we ordered a full bottle of wine. The barista brought out two glasses and started telling us about the wine as he served us.

When the time came for me to leave, I stood up from the bar and left Sonny with a third of our wine.

I walked down the street, trying to dodge the eyes of strangers.

I got outside my destination and considered sending a text to Fabiola letting her know I was outside. Mere instants after I sent it, I heard a rattle behind the door. She opened the door to let whom I guessed to be her previous client.

She invited me in and guided me up the stairs of the small library that Sonny told me about, pass the balcony and up to a small room by the upper terrace.

She made some comments about finally seeing me in person. The session flowed more freely than other times. I shared with her what I didn't dare telling Aliza nor Sonny about my recent thoughts regarding detransitioning.

I talked about my masculine outfit and the constant misgendering. I thought about the stark contrast of feeling the most attractive person in the whole bar and being dysphorically disgusted by the image of the video that a friend of Sonny took of us window shopping cameras by the city's centre.

I talked about not trusting reality. Be it the reflection of the mirror or the compliments of one-night-lovers.

The session ended. She walked me downstairs and I walked back the same route to Sonny and a half-finished bottle of white wine.

This time there were a group of people sitting on one of the tables outside.

I shared with Sonny how I have been thinking about detransition. She was reasonably surprised, but made no significant comments about it.

"It's not that I want to do it," I assured her, "I just keep thinking about it a lot."

We asked for our bill and I paid with my mexican credit card. We left and the barista and his friends started cleaning the place. Sonny ordered us an Uber back to her house.

I got a message from Paty in Whatsapp. She told me she could meet with me the next day at 12h or 13h, but she had a meeting at 16h30 which would make her have to leave at 16h. I told her I had thought about going to Coyoacán, given Sonny would be taking my luggage in her car to her match. Nonetheless, that was due to me leaving to the airport right after being with her; if she had to leave early and I had enough time to get back to Sonny's house, there was no need to plan our day around Sonny's match. After a brief back and forth, she accepted my proposal to meet in Condesa at 11h30.

Sonny and I watched I saw the TV glow in her living room upstairs. Sonny was able to pick up on the trans themes, but was unsure about it.

"¿De qué trata?, ¿es de cosas gays?"

Before going to bed, after Sonny told me that the metro station that I proposed to meet at was not functioning, I asked Paty to meet at Chilpancingo instead.

The morning of the day of my departure, I texted Paty again asking her to confirm she had gotten my last message.

"No me ignores porque me enamoro."

She reached back with an audio saying she had read the message and thought she had replied back. Lastly, she confirmed our meeting time and said she would hurry.

Sonny got out of bed at around 9h. We went out to the flea market with the intention of getting some breakfast together. The spot we were looking for hadn't set up yet, so we got some tacos de carnitas.

I borrowed Sonny's metro card again. I walked down to the Cablebús. I put money on the card using the machines by the entrance to the metro.

"Voy como el raio makuin solo que hay un poco de tráfico."

I reassured her not to worry and told her that the metro was going very slow, too.

I got to our agreed meeting spot with plenty of time. I climbed the stairs exiting the metro station and saw the big letters of the Tim Horton's across the street. I considered going there and getting myself a coffee while I waited for Paty. I changed my mind after I thought that we would probably have breakfast, and I would want to have my coffee with her.

I wandered around looking for a place where I could sit and wait. Towards the metrobus station, on the corner, there was a large departmental store. I walked to the intersection and waited for the lights to change and let me cross the street to the side of the Tim Horton's.

A lady asked me if Viaducto was a metro station. I confessed to her that, while I thought it was, I had no idea since I wasn't really from the city. She replied that she didn't know either and she was in fact from there. She asked me where I was coming from. I decided against mentioning Canada, and just told her that I am originally from Baja California. We finished crossing the street and she wished me a good day.

I sat down in front of a bolero. A man came to him and sat down on his high chair. I considered taking out my camera and shooting a picture of them.

Around 15 minutes before 11h30, she texted me to let me know that she was already on the metrobus.

I would look towards the people crossing the street and try to fantasize about their lives. With every red bus that approached the stop, I would guess if that were the one from which she would step down.

I lost count of the number of buses that came and went.

At 11h48, she texted me to let me know she was trapped in Insurgentes. The cars would invade the bus lane and make a chaos out of the road. I checked the map and suggested her to get off two stations before, on Sonora, and I could walk and meet her there. She took my offer.

"Va, aber quiene gana"

Halfway there, I saw her silhouette take form in the distance as she walked towards me. We hugged and she grumbled about the missed calls that I did't pick up.

This time, I think it was me who reached out and grabbed her hand.

We walked towards the park. She shared with me her annoyance with the foreigners and their telltale of speaking English. I asked her if she had already eaten breakfast. We could go somewhere around there.

We passed La churrería El Moro. Last time we met, the idea came up of going there since I've never been before in all the years I've lived in the city. I asked her if churros would be enough of a breakfast. She dismissed my concerns, saying she usually has worse. We would keep walking for a bit, before coming back for our sugary food.

She had taken the day off after all. They were going to reprimand her in her evening meeting. She was feeling nervous about it.

We passed by the park and saw all the different dogs being walked. By the big fountain in the centre, on one of the paths hidden by the trees, there was a large group of dogs being trained.

Paty told me how after talking with Bertha the day before, she had said something that made her fall from her graces. It was an off-hand comment that was tinted by classism. They were talking about something that made her exclaim how she didn't understand how people would choose to live outside the city. The comment hit a sensitive spot for Paty. She reminded me how even 5 years ago when we met on Yaaj, she used to live very far away. It is never a choice. That Bertha failed to see that, made her much less attractive.

I wondered which comment have—or might soon—made her lose her attraction to me.

We wandered through the park and continued our walk through the neighbourhood until we circled back to El Moro. We walked inside and went to the window to place our order. She wanted a torta, but they didn't have any. She asked about the milkshakes, but they didn't have those either. We got ourselves four churros, an iced chocolote and an iced café de olla.

We waited for our food. I saw a korean woman approach the cashier and place her order in broken Spanish. I thought about Aliza and her whereabouts. She would be somewhere in Japan.

When our beverages and food were ready, we took them to one of the tables outside. She put her plastic cup on the chair facing the street. I asked her to switch places. I imagined her sitting with her back to the park. That would be a much better background were I to take a picture of her. She suspiciously asked me for the reason behind my request. I don't remember how was it that I convinced her.

I took my camera out of the bag and showed it to her. I went through the basics of how it works, what the different numbers and dials in the lens do, how is it that the aperture opens up for a specific amount of time letting the precisely calculated amount of light inside the back chamber tinting the film. I explained all of this as I pointed the camera towards her and saw her through it. I shot two pictures.

We talked about languages. We went through the different ways to call a loved one in French or in German. When was the last time that anyone called me love?

In our two meetings, I called her mi amor several times. She didn't react in any way. It was not abnormal. When we were in Yaaj, it was common to call everyone baby or love. Once I was in Church pub when Aliza saw our conversation and made a remark of how Paty called me princesa.

She told me about this place that she'd like to take me. I've forgotten most of the details. It's a cementary somewhere in a small town in Hidalgo. Were those plans something like that invitation to take pictures sometimes?

We finished our drinks and our food. We stood up and retook our walk.

If we held hands again, it was mine the one that looked for hers.

We walked through the small corridours framed in plants between the roads. We shared and laughed. We got ourselves to an empty fountain that seemed to be hidden away from the rest of the world. I subtly guided us to sit on the edge of it. She sat besides me, as close as she could. It was still not enough. In the middle of our conversation, sometimes I would raise my leg resting my foot in a small crevice of the stone. My knee would gently push her side. Some other times, she would let her arm fall over my leg. It would not stay there for long.

Time passed much faster than I deserved.

She stayed longer than she had let me know she would have to.

We started walking back. I put my hand through her arm.

Each metrobus stop we passed, I would fear that it would be the one where we would part ways.

¿Qué le diré a mis amigas cuando me pregunten por qué no nos besamos?

"¿Le contaste a alguien que saldrías conmigo?"

She interrupted her own answer telling me about Aylin and Frida to return the question. Why was I asking. I assured her it was only curiosity, but she was not convinced. She asked me again.

Did I scare her?

She started telling me about this app in her phone that shares the location in real time. I felt overly self-conscious and wished that I could turn back time and swallow back my own question.

I said that I had told Sonny, obviously, and Aliza. I made no mention of Alda telling me that she was cute when I shared our picture last Sunday.

We got to the intersection where we were supposed to meet. She was nervous about the meeting she was going to. I offered to go with her to her job and from there leave to Sonny's, but she rejected the idea. She wanted some time to herself. I didn't push it. The plan was then for me to take the metro and she would take the metrobus.

I looked at her and felt a hunger-like sensation in my stomach. A push that tried to convince me to put my hands on her waist and slowly approach her lips.

Instead, I just hugged her.

I saw the light turn green signaling her to cross the street. I was not ready to let her go.

We moved back and I held both of her hands. I looked at her deeply in her eyes, silently begging her to do what I did not dare.

She wished me a nice trip and repeated to both of us how she would look into the Canadian visa and I would have to pay attention to how Halloween is celebrated in Montréal.

We finally parted ways and I couldn't bear the absence of our kiss in our little story.

I took myself back to Sonny's neighbourhood, all the way thinking about the kiss that didn't happen.

Sonny asked me to let her know when I rode the cablebús, and she would try to come pick me up. When I got out of the station, she was sitting in the gray car across the street, waiting for me.

The plan was to drive to Sonny's match and from there, I would order myself an Uber to the airport.

Sonny drove first to Paty's––her Paty, not mine––house to pick up a package. That small detour made her not get to her match on time. There was much more traffic than what we were expecting. I started worrying about the possibility of missing my flight.

Sonny suggested that, as we were actually really close to the airport, she could let me off around the area and I could get my Uber from there.

The ETA kept being pushed further and further. In my head I started doing the math. I told Sonny with the second intention of trying to convince myself that, where I to miss my flight, I could stay in Mexico City for the weekend and that would give me the opportunity to go to Pride.

I fantasized about having a second chance of seeing Paty again. Reaching out to her and meeting with her somewhere during Pride.

Sonny nudged me to check for the prices of the flight Sunday or Monday. The cold numbers ripped me out of my regret-fueled fantasy.

It got to the point that Sonny was no longer able to get there for the first half. She explained to me me how, according to the rules, if she didn't get there before the start of the second half, she would not be allowed to play at all. She got annoyed and upset with Paty's chat conversation. She decided to stop replying, turned off the location she had started to share, and drove me to the airport.

I had texted Paty––mine––asking her how the meeting had gone, before leaving Sonny's house. She did not reply until the next day.

We left the car in the parking lot of the airport. First, we passed to the restrooms. Inside the stall, after peeing, I tucked carefully trying to rig the gamble that is being patted down in security. We made a stop at the Starbucks and Sonny got herself a coffee. We sat down on the small terrace outside the terminal and chatted while she finished it.

Again, for a second time in the day, it was time to part ways. Sonny told me that she would miss me. I reminded her that we would see each other again in less than a week.

The line through security was slow. I passed the full-body scanner without any flags. I walked with plenty of time to spare to the gate of my flight.

As people positioned themselves on the different lines, I decided to remain seated.

A woman with a strong english accent approached me as sir and asked me if I had Whatsapp. I lied to her and turned away.

Despite being one of the last people to board the plane, I still found a spot on the overhead compartments for my luggage. There was a father and a kid sitting next to me on the plane.

I started writing these words, but gave up an hour before landing.

The plane landed on my hometown. My parents picked me up and drove me to the house of my youth. Nymi welcomed me with excited moans and jumps.

The next morning, I woke up to a text from Paty.

"...de la verga. Ya te contaré cuando esté más tranquila" she promised.

She threw back the question to me, asking me about my flight.

I told her about my worry about missing my flight, without making any mention to my secondary fantasy. We continued chatting for a bit, before I fell back to sleep.

That Saturday, while she went to the parade, I spent most of the day sleeping.

I posted a picture of Nymi on Instagram with the caption le petit morceau de coeur qui me manquait. She was one of the many people that liked it.

Sunday, my family and I went to La Macha for breakfast.

I asked them to make a stop at a convenience store to buy lotion for my tattoo.

I took a picture of the sole-less tennis shoes from my tale of Cuba. I sent them to her. When we were sitting on the edge of the waterless fountain, Paty took out her phone and let me get a glimpse of her life. In one of the screencaptures she had sent me during the week, there was a brief message telling her that the sender had had a dream with her. As she opened her Instagram, the large message narrating this dream was in one of the many conversations with unviewed new messages. I rested my head on her shoulder as we both read this third person's dream. The pictures of my shoes, like that intimate dream message, remain unviewed or unacknowledged

Today, I woke up with a fire in my throat and my voice hollow.

## November, 2024

### Friday, November 8th, 2024

 Every day I send you an e-mail, in it I writemy news, every time I end with a request: ifyou're there and you're well,don't write back.

- Tadeusz Dąbrowski   Yesterday, the picture of Bea—with her greyish blue eyes and her closed-mouth smile, with the quote from To the Lighthouse and the vague invitation for casual fun that could flower into something greater—came up among the series of pictures of strangers in Tinder. I paused my procrastination of almost mindlessly rejecting the vague idea of women formed by one or two pictures by the swipe of a finger. I thought about that night almost half a year ago. I was back to that evening in a barely occupied bar in NDG, to that night on a bed inside an apartment just five minutes away.

I swiped to the right. In the minutest moment I imagined a thousand possibilities, every one of them crumbled down when nothing happened. I found a rejection in the uneventfulness.

That same day—or maybe one before—I sent María José the snapshot from my journal that surrounded my encounter with The Editor.

"Toca aprender de mis otros casi-algos que la atención no se ruega; if they're interested, they''ll let me know", I wrote to Majo mere moments before I shared in our conversation the picture of the co-protagonist of that short story from my past.

I was referring to one of the latest women I met in this last phase of dating since the break I took this summer. The French filmmaker and photographer. Clara, the woman whom I met and conversed with months ago before cancelling last-minute on her and deleting the dating apps. We rematched without recognizing each other. I confessed my sin after I remembered when I found an archived screen picture of our last messages in French. Still, she decided to meet with me. And if first dates are too stressful, let's skip to the second one directly, technically we already almost had one. I wore a red dress and a face of make-up to our date in Chez Ernest. She came a couple of minutes late. I recognized her as soon as she stepped foot inside the half-empty bar. I stood up and hugged her, initiating the conversation that would continue for more than six hours until it ended with a second hug at the bust stop outside an A&W.

Unlike many other dates, she replied back enthusiastically—albeit one or two days later—when I reached out to tell her I would love the idea of seeing her again. She suggested the next weekend when she might be free if she worked efficiently the week up to it. I accepted the invitation and proposed to touch base again by the end of the week. That message, up to this moment five days later, remains unopened.

In the middle of our date, she asked to see some of my pictures. I grabbed my phone and opened my instagram account. She inspected some of them and then glanced up to the username that served as a title of the screen. She thought aloud to herself how she would made notice of it to search for me later. Later came much earlier than I expected when she stood up to the restrooms and searched for me there.

Last night, Vicky organized an evening of drinks at Thomson House. This time we were many more people than the last one, when it was just her and me as the elders accompanying the three new PhD students that have joined our lab this summer. Beside the—both old and new—students of Louis, there were also a couple of women who were co-supervised by him whose names I don't remember.

After leaving the clubhouse and one by one of my older labmates were stepping off the group to follow their route home, I opened up one of the pictures I took of myself in The Neuro's restroom mirror and posted it as a story in instagram. My reflection was standing phone in hand, wearing the brown and cream sweater my mother knitted me under the gray sports coat that I found and bought at Eva B. My mom made me and this sweater, I captioned it.

The first person to see it and like it was Sonny, less than a minute before it was posted. Then it was Paty. Then, a bunch of other nameless acquaintances. I was sitting on my black couch in front of the unwatched television when I saw Clara in the list of spectators, before I got distracted by the sudden appearance of an old paramour.

This morning, I woke up with the notification that Clara—a couple of minutes past midnight and around two hours after she first saw it—went back to it to like it.

Right now I see La grain brûlée's toy ferris wheel spinning past the screen of my laptop as I consider whether or not echo my unseen message asking whether or not I'll see the last woman whom I am inevitably idolizing.

### Saturday, November 9th, 2024

"We'll see each other again, right? ...I hope?"

"Yeah; no, yes. Definitively."  I went to eat Falafel with Majo last night.

I don't remember the first half of the day up until I was sitting on the wall benches right at the middle of the quai of the metro. The earbuds in my ears made me feel invisible as I waited for her. I got there earlier.

She arrived and did not see me. She called me from one of the exits. When she came back, she got walked down to the opposite side of me. I saw her walking with hear headphones on her head. I whistled and called her name, but she did not notice me. When she finally turned, I pointed to the direction she was walking and met upstairs.

We decided to catch another train and move another station further west to get closer to the place.

We stayed in the food joint eating and talking, keeping each other company. We talked about friendship, family, and first love. Somewhere in our conversation I confessed to her how I was unsure of reaching out to Clara and if the date was going to take place.

My head went back to earlier this year and how I craved the idea of being pursued. How warmth it felt to be the one to affirm the question about the potential of meeting again. The disappointment of having to reach out to the void asking whether I am wanted or not.

Leaving Falafel Yoni, we had the intention of keeping the night and conversation alives in a bar nearby. We tried Dieu du ciel, Siboire, Henrietta, Datcha, Darling; we kept walking through St-Laurent hoping to find a place with some available space to sit down. By the time we passed Bifteck, we decided to just call it a night.

"Not to pressure you or anything, but I did say that I would text her when we were at the bar," I said to Majo when we were a couple of blocks before Station St-Laurent.

We talked about women's inherent issues with identifying or expressing their desire. I told her about the sex dream I had with Aliza during our evening and night together in Maryland. Then, I also talked about the way Alda got worried after I shared I had a sex dream of her, only to then share she had dreamed about me before, too, after I calmed down her nerves of thinking I was into her.

We parted ways when we went to different directions of the green line. I hid again in my music and wrote down a draft of the short text that I would send her in instagram, still unconvinced. I did not send it by the time the metro arrived.

I think I was already back home when I endede up reaching out. Not long after, she liked the past text from Monday and told me that she could do lunch today. She forewarned me, though, that she would have to get back to work. It was my call.

I woke up today without the alarm at around 6h or 7h. I dreamed that she had gotten back to me with a reason to cancel or postpone. There were no real new messages on the screen of my phone.

Around an hour later, she surfaced with a text proposing to meet at a dumpling place she's been intending to check out. She had a second suggestion, in case dumplings were not my thing, consisting of a café nearby that she frequents.

We did go to the dumpling place. I got there first. I peeked inside wondering if she was already there. I texted her asking about it. She was one minute away, she said, thus I stayed outside and sat down on a bench nearby.

She asked me about the birthday plans for tomorrow. I told her about the Lasertag, how I had already paid for it despite not being too fond of the idea, and Alda's offer of killing me prematurely to quickly end my suffering. I told her about the story I owed her about the second to last time I met with Vero and she made us crash a family party in a church. I asked her about if she missed our shared cultural custom of kissing on the cheek as a greeting and farewell. I then asked her if she has ever offered or been asked to take pictures of her dates. We talked about it. I don't remember if I told her how that question had rosen from my recent reading of the night with Bea.

I did not finish my plate of noodles. I told her that even though I did not want her to leave, I understoo if she had to. She asked me for the time before looking at it herself on her phone screen. It was 10 minutes before 14h, the time she had set aside for me.

"I have 10 more minutes, then," I said smiling. "Good."

The 10 minutes passed us and, maybe if I had not said anything about how she was giving me extra time, she could probably had stayed there for longer.

We payed for our food and walked together to the corner of the street. Somewhen in our date, I proposed to her to talk in French the next time we met. Somewhen, too, she apologized for not reaching out until Friday. She reassured me then that she would be less busy from now on. Still, when we were saying our goodbyes, just like last time, she proposed the doubt of whether we'd see each other again, and added the clarification that she would hope so. It was me who assured us both.

"She's making dating fun," I texted Alda.

### Monday, November 11th, 2024

"Dear diary, today, with @aldaprofka and @vero.raphael, I discovered there is actually some fun in killing 8 year olds."  I did not get home that late, but still I was exhausted enough that I decided not to open up my laptop to write.

Yesterday, I woke up already tired.

Alda reached out and gently reminded me that we had planned with Renzo to meet for Indian food in the early afternoon, in case I had forgotten. I thanked her and confessed that I actually did. That ruined my plans of sleeping in and barely function in my living room until the early evening before getting ready for meeting Vero. I instead got up from bed before noon and left the house not much after.

I was the first one to arrive to the indian restaurant. It was the second time in the week that I ate indian food. I waited outside leaning on a black parting sign listening to my iPod. Alda arrived a couple of minutes before the time we had agreed to meet Renzo. We decided to come inside and wait for him there, guarded from the autumn chilly winds. The waitress sat us in a table by the window. I made notice of how we could see him arrive.

We did not see him come. He got inside and saw us first. We talked a bit about what had happened in the three or four weeks since the last time we all met. That time we had gone to eat chinese noodles and walked aroud Old Port. He was telling us about a guy he was going to meet for the first time in Verdun. He has been dating him since. This man asked him to be boyfriends, but he got scared from the term.

Contrary to the indian restuarant I went to earlier in the week with Majo, this one was full of indian people. There was a large family dinning at the table in front of us. The waitress, just like the waiter before, warned me about the spice in my order.

We continued chatting and told him of our plans of meeting our friend, Vero, for her birthday and going to play lasertag. He told us about his experience and how the game usually works.

"Wait, how old were you when you played?" I asked him later.

He did not remember exactly, but he was a teenager.

Alda said that she felt like a drink, that maybe could help her enjoy the evening of the game. She proposed going to McKibbins. I tried to remember the times that I have been to that bar. I went to one of their branches with Aliza and some people of her lab, including Vlad. Other time, many months—years, maybe?—before, I went to a different one with Valerie. It was the date where I told her that I was thinking of applying for a job as an editor of a journal.

When Alda mentioned her plan of ordering straight Whisky, I offered her instead of going to N. I had just remembered reading the reference to that bar in the text I sent Majo a couple of days before. When we got there, after we sat down and maybe even after we had gotten our drinks, I told them about how I had been there three times before. The last time it was my last date with Sophie. Before that, I had gone on a date with a post-doc of McGill. The first one, it was also a date but with a couple whom I later accompanied home and spent the night at their house. All three of those times, I met with people whom I never saw again.

After finishing our drinks—them a glass of gin and me a cup of hot cider—we said goodbye to Renzo and made a stop at McDonald's to grab a quick coffee before going to Vero's.

She had asked us to arrive at 17h at the latest, since we had to be at the place at 17h30 and we could not be late. We made it there and even got inside and went upstairs to her floor with plenty of time to spare. We knocked on her door after confirming her apartment number with her by text. Her brother Peter received us and made us small-talk while she finished getting ready. We were late.

The guy at the entrance rushed us in and asked Alda to pay the rest of the entrance fee, since the deposit didn't cover it completely. He reached the terminal to her and the amount of 2.90 CAD appeared on the small screen. She tapped her card on the top to make it disappear. When it got to my turn, the screen displayed instead 26CAD. I hesitated before tapping my phone and asked him why the charges were different. I didn't completely understand his explanation since my mind was busy remembering how days before I had transferred money to Vero to cover for the deposit of the place. I looked at her and she offered to pay for it. I said nothing and just moved myself to Alda's side.

As people kept paying, another 18 year old wearing a green polo with the logo of the place guided us to a small room where a video was playing with the instructions of the game. The room would have been pitch-black were not for the muted colours of the video on the large screen narrating a bunch of instructions that I did not completely understood. I noticed the dark shapes of a large group of kids sitting on the floor much much younger than the expected teenagers.

"Do you have any questions?" the guy standing next to the screen reached out to the kids.

"Are the grown-ups going to play, too?"

After the video ended and all of the kids went first to the room next door to grab the electronic vests that were hanging on two sets of protruding arms that extended from the facing walls, it was our turn to come in and get ready. I grabbed one and put it on awkwardly. I felt uncomfortable and self-conscious. I wanted the activity to end even before it started.

The first half I felt uncomfortably shooting the electronic laser towards the children that were half of my size running around. I stayed on one of the corners and met Rowan, the only non-black friend of Vero other than me and Alda.

"Oh, you speak Spanish?" she asked after I said something. "It shows," she finished the thought after I answered affirmatively. There was no malice in her way of saying it, yet I felt uncomfortable.

Bliss—is that how his name is spelled—activated something that was called spy mode, which set to red the colour of his originally green vest. He was freely shooting at our base and perpetually earning points. I did not care enough to stop him.

I tried to play the game, but I felt too self-conscious of my large body moving around.

The screen of my pistol stopped working. I went outside to tell one of the workers. He instructed me to switch vests. I lost all of the few points that I had earned.

When I went back in, I decided to really try again. I moved to the back and decided to shoot at the kids that would try to approach and invade our base. I would silently shoot at their backs or shoulders without them noticing. Some of them just suddenly realized they had somehow ran out of lives, others did become aware of me but had no time to do anything about it. By the time the last game ended, even though I didn't notice if we won or lost, I saw that PLAYER11, me, had the most points of the red team.

We finished the night at an italian restaurant with some of Vero's friends. Alda and I shared half-a-liter of the house's white wine. I got a plate of minestrone soup and a sausage entrée. Alda got herself a caesar's salad—not realizing the waiter was upselling her when he offered—, a lasagna and a second cocktail.

This morning I was able to wake up before 8h and get to the office on time. I made a stop at Baristello to buy a bag of coffee beans. I thought I could get a second one for Walter's birthday gift. There was an offer for three bags for 40 CADs.

I got to the lab and bought me a large coffee and a carrot muffin from the cafeteria on the third floor.

There was a students and post-doc's seminar where Jonathan presented his work under Sylvia and Sylvain's supervision. Majo got there and sat on the row of chairs by the wall behind me.

Halfway through the talk, I went outside to pee and saw a women setting up the platter of pizzas. Before coming back in, she asked me if I knew how many people were inside.

The talk ended and I went outside with Majo. Both of us got a slice of the vegeratian ones and went to a table where the second speaker was already standing. Neither of us acknowledged him. Emily, a friend of Majo, came and started talking to us.

I went to meet with Jonathan to say Hi. He was talking to Neda. I was catching up with him, hearing about his upcoming thesis seminar and sharing my plans with doing my post-doc with Sylvia, when the lady approached me with a plate.

"Here, I noticed you like vegetarian, have the last slice."

Today, I finally got the reviews—or rather single review—for the HVR paper that I submitted back in late July. Daniel practiced his pre-submission meeting on our lab meeting. I registered for the ADPD conference that will take place on Vienna next spring and payed the 400EUR.

I texted Majo asking her if she wanted to do something in the afternoon. We went to Thomson house and talked about friendship, unhealthy attachment, my anxieties about showing my unreciprocated interest. She convinced me of reaching out to Clara and being open about my needs and expectations.

I sent a text to both Clara and Paty.

Clara replied back.

### Tuesday, November 12th, 2024

 "Je t'écris pour t'informer que je viens de voir une souris courir dans mon appartemant."   I washed my sheets yesterday. The warmth and sweet smell made it more difficult to get out of bed in the morning. I had the PD meeting that was cancelled last week at the Neuro, but it was not until noon.

I made a stop at the bakery before taking the metro. This time, instead of buying a croisssant, I got myself a pain au choco-amandes and I started eating it on my way to the Neuro. I finished it even before getting to Station Sherbrooke.

This past few weeks I've been having to walk all the way to the office. They are working on des Pins, so the 144 bus takes a detour. These 4km walks might be a contributing factor to me losing weight. Last time I weighted myself I hit the soft goal of reaching 75Kg. Yesterday that I was walking to Thomson besides Majo, I was telling her how my green pants that I bought just a couple of months ago in Philadelphia are now loose on my body. I told her that I was still a couple of kilograms shy of my goal of reaching my body of two years ago. She told me that I was thin enough, and any more, to her eyes, would be too much.

I saw a notification from instagram in my phone as I was walking outside the metro station. It was from Paty. She had laughed at the reel I sent her that said: Cuando the escribo que estoy en tu ciudad y me respondes: ojalá te diviertas!

"¿Cómo crees, Sofía?", says the second of the two messages that I did not open.

I worked in the morning until the time came to look for the room where the meeting would take place. I saw Vicky pass by and I asked her if she knew where it would be. After she told me how it would be where the IGNS meetings take place and she was walking in direction to the Viper Pit, I asked her if she was going there. She said yes and offered me to walk with her.

I felt hungry after the meeting despite having had breakfast.

Aliza sent me the link for her mock candidacy. I did not have time to do much work before it was the time to connect. I took my ipad, headphones, a small notepad and my waterbottle and went towards the small cabine for videoconferences. The meeting started at 15H, and it wasn't until a couple of minutes before 17H that it ended. I made some coments and suggestions, but the majority of the feedback was given by her supervisors.

I text Majo and told her how Aliza is even less ready than what I had thought. There was almost no information about the other aims that she has yet to start. I sent her an email with my thoughts and offered to help her in any way I can. We'll have a videocall tomorrow morning before my session with Fabiola.

I passed by metro and bought a plate of hummus, a bag of bologna, a bag of caesar salad, and a small chicken sandwich. I ate the submarine on my walk to the metro. When I got to the station, I thought about passing by the library to pick up the book that was set apart for me. I started it on the way back home, but could not read more than a handful of pages.

I got home, set aside my stuff and lied down on my couch to watch unimportant stuff in my phone. I sensed a shadow move in that barely perceptible field of view. I turned my head and caught notice of a small brownish mouse run in the white vent of the heating system of my apartment.

I stood up paradoxically since the least thing that I wanted to do was to go search for the rodent. I drafted an email in French to Didier to let him know. I passed the broom through the apartment looking for droppings. There was a lot of dust—too much more than what should be—but no poops. I moved the bed and heard noises coming from the closet. I went there and saw another—hopefully the same, but probably not—mouse run from one end of the back closet towards the other.  I decided to put on some shoes and buy some traps from Dollarama. I had not finished setting my thoughts in order before I saw yet another—again, hopefully the same—small brown animal escape from the room towards the back of the television.

Alda offered me to sleep at her place. I considered it, but decided against it. Hopefully I am able to sleep without focusing on the silence of the nigh

"So you enjoyed [it] generally speaking?

"Also, there are not a lot of places where you can fight children legitimately."   After setting the traps, and one brief moment of around a minute when I continuously heard scratching, I heard nothing the rest of the night. I went to bed and slept in relative peace.

I found it hard to wake up in the morning. I had agreed to have a videocall with Aliza to talk about her project proposal for her candidacy. I offered her anytime before noon, since I'd see Fabiola then. She picked 10h. I didn't get up until 40 minutes before our agreed time. I warned her that I would just shower and might end up connecting a couple of minutes late.

I also had talked with Alda about meeting at Oui mais non to work together, after finishing with my therapy. She did not end up going. I told her it was fine and we could do it another time.

My first couple of minutes with Fabiola consisted in telling her my adventures last night with the mice. I told her how Didier's response was pretty fast and even that morning I received an email from the guy would was supposed to come and put the products asking for my address in the very early morning.

I talked about what has been happening with my increased social outings, and particularly with my latest phase of dating. I gave her a brief recap of my last dates with Clara and my anxiety about the similar patterns of communication that remind me of Sophie. In my retelling, I mentioned the conversation I had with Majo at Thomson on which I told her of my dilemma between starting to disconnect from this potential connection now that it is still early and being open emotionally and letting her know that I am interested in pursuing something further with her, but the ways we are communicating confuse me.

Fabiola said that, in her opinion, it is not yet the moment to start working in letting go. Without knowing, she reaffirmed Majo's suggestion of giving her another date, another opportunity to talked about us, explicitly state our interest confirming it is mutual, and sharing our expectations of us, of each other.

My breakfast was the oatmeal cookie I bought last night at Dollarama with the four mouse traps that I spread over my apartment. I drank the iced coffee I made myself during my call with Aliza. On my afternoon work in Oui mais non I ordered a chai latee. I have been working on implementing the code to run the CNN segmentation within the longitudinal pipeline. Tomorrow I am meeting with Louis and I don't have much to show him. I guess I can talk with him about the timeline and the scheduling of my thesis seminar early next year.

At around 18h30, the screen of my laptop suddenly shut off. It had been a while since I looked at the battery icon appearing on the corner of the screen. I took out the book that I picked up yesterday from the library and read a couple of pages. When I finished the short first chapter, I grabbed my stuff, left my empty glass on the bus tray by the stairs and starting walking home.

I don't remember exactly the time—it must have been before getting into the café—when I wrote a brief story narrating my night. When I was craving the other night not to sleep alone, I didn't mean to spend the night accompanied by mice running around in my room. As other times, I kept checking the viewers to see if I would see Clara's name in the list. She finally showed up around an hour or two after its inception. I was around the bakery where I buy my morning croissants when I saw the first notification letting me know that clarabelais had liked my message. Then, one by one, I could read the first portion of her subsequent replies on the following notifications. The last notification was, once again like as last week, letting me infer that she had gone back to my profile to see a story that she had already seen to purposefully like it. The evening was colder than I expected, so I put away my hands together with mi cold hands inside my jacket pockets.

When I opened her conversation I saw how not only had she replied to my comment about finally meeting a deadline and continued the conversation about my lasertag story, but also replied to the white text with the image of Mickey Mouse.

"Not a mice fan ?"

### Thursday, November 14th, 2024

"hey, i really want to see you. it's very short notice, but are you free tomorrow? or this weekend?"  I was arriving to Station Jarry when Majo replied to my text saying they were still at Walter's house drinking mezcal and talking about their biggest heart-breaks. I was very tempted to do what I recently did with Majo of turning around and getting back to meet with them. Despite considering it, I did not go peeing before leaving Brewsky with Florence. I changed my mind mid-text and came back to my original plan of coming home.

I went to the office in the morning since I had a meeting with Louis. Sasha switched places and moved to the Viper Pit with Marc Antoine and Raphaël. I remember not understanding Reza's questions about if it was personal for me leaving that office, but now seeing her grab her computer and switching places, I suddenly could relate to Reza's insecurity.

I recevied Aliza's proposal document in the morning and I promised her that I would look at it throughout my day. I did. I kept going back to it here and then when I needed a distraction from my python script adapting the HVR CNN for modular use.

"Sofía, I have a question. What is this?" asked me Raphaël early in my day, before I had even finished my coffee. I talked with him about my use of the terminal, tmux and vim. How I prefer a workflow that is centered on the keyboard. I talked about my choice of window manager and how coding and scripting became a hobby for me while I was doing my master's.

In the early evening, I agreed to meet Majo before going to Walter's place. We went to have something to eat at McDonald's. On the way there she told me about how she feels in love with her work related to babies. She sees them, handles them, carries them, and feels some sort of intrinsic physical urge for them. She was sure of not wanting to have kids. A security that is no longer there.

I told her about my two dreams: the one where I dreamed I had a period and the other one where I dreamed I had gotten pregnant. Maternity was a subject that we had been coming back to lately and which was very present in our conversation today.

Since the very morning I woke up, particularly during my walk to the metro as I was going to the office, I kept coming back to the idea of reaching out to Clara despite not having an answer from my latest messages. I wanted to tell her—confess?—that I want to see her. Ask her if she is free this weekend, even despite the fact that mine it is not free.

Miriam texted me during the day. She said that she had not found anything particularly fun for this Saturday. She proposed going for coffee or maybe going to the movies. I replied that both ideas seemed good to me. I asked her what films were recently out. The new gladiator movie with Pedro Pascal and Paul Mescal came to mind. I was disappointed to find out that it was still not out. I remembered Cinéma Moderne. Looking into their schedule I found a showing of several award winning shorts and a talk with one of the film-makers. I thought about the dating idea I had saved for Clara and proposed it as a platonic date for Miriam. She seemed fond of the idea, so I bought the two tickets. Later, she told that she'd confirmed with me later about when to meet, given she had an appointment that would end at 17h. I thought I could always invite Majo were she not able to make it.

Walter texted us to say that he was ready and we were welcome to come to his house whenever we were ready just a couple of minutes after we finished our McDonald's burgers.

Melissa, the friend that I met once with Aliza and Alda was the second person to arrive after us. Then it was Amelie and her boyfriend. Jana was the last one to arrive just around half-an-hour before it was my time to leave. She brought a cake and a six pack of chinese beers.

"I love you", I told her jokingly as she took the warm bottles out of her backpack.

I agreed to meet Florence at Brewsky at 20h. I had calculated to take a bus there, but I missed it. I had to walk—run—to catch the 107 one that would get me a bit closer. During the walk by the Old Port at night, as I passed next to the lamps that shined like a strip of lightened ants next to the barely visible water of the river, I kept thinking about Clara. I considered more and more sending out that text that was haunting me since the morning.

A couple of minutes before my arrival, I opened the tinder conversation with Florence and there was a last message letting me know she had arrived. I told her how there were two sides/entrances to the same bar and we never agreed on which one to meet. I went to the wrong one and got in. I told the bus boy that I was not sure if my friend was already inside. All of the tables were full of people, so he told me they were probably on the other side. Florence was indeed on a table next by the entrance.

It wasn't until I sat down in front of her that I noticed how she was the spitting image of Monica. The shape of her face, her round eyes, the silhouette of her smile. Years ago that would have been reason enough for me to want to be close to her, to find out if the taste of her lips would awaken those forgotten memories.

In her strong french accent, she asked me if I was willing to get a tarot read. She had just gotten a deck from her friend, and she thought it would be fun to use it to find out my goal of the night. I excitedly agreed, without really worrying about what secrets would the cards reveal her.

My card was the chariot. She explained how it had to do with the future. How I was coming in a way to find out how to move forward, discoreing what is it that I wanted and how I could achieve it.

Hers was the fool. From what I understood it was about childhood innocence and playful discovery.

We ordered our drinks and started our conversation. She mentioned how she had been going through something very dramatic. She had to send out very deep and emotional texts. Later in the night, she let me know that they had to do with a trans women who had gotten her pregnant. She aborted the baby and had to deal with the pain and grief of her choice without letting her know. Years later, she had come back to her life and she was not ready to face her.

Offhandedly, she had mentioned she was tired. She had only slept a couple of hours last night. I told her I could relate thinking back to the fairly recent nights where I didn't need to sleep.

"This is something that I always try to say on the first date. I am bipolar."

For the first time, it wasn't me who had to confess something in the first date.

Like Alice, many years ago, now it was me who said me too.

When I asked her about her experiences disclosing to her dates, I shared that for me personally it was not something that I really think of during my dates. It wasn't until one or two hours later that I finished the thought and let her know that I am trans.

She did not know.

I saw in her eyes as she connected the dots moments before mentioning outloud the trans flag that is next to the mexican one in my profile. She had seen it, noticed it, suspected it; yet she was not sure. She saw my pictures, she saw me in person, she was sitting, facing me, for hours, and yet she was still surprised when I mentioned it.

After two pints on my side and three of hers, we called it a night. We walked together to the metro and rode the orange line until Berri-UQAM, where she took off to switch to the green line.

As she exited the train, I sat down on a free seat by the window. I grabbed my phone, opened Majo's conversation to let her knwo how I would talk to her about my latest date in relation to 1) being bipolar, 2) maternity, 3) her being the spitting image of Monica, 4) the trans flag, and 5) the tarot reading.

In another conversation, I wrote a raw, vulnerable, and hopeful text that I desperately hope won't go long before being opened and eventually replied.

### Friday, November 15th, 2024

"hi Sofía, sorry i am not really..."   Sonny thinks I might be slipping somwhere closer into a hypomanic episode. After yesterday's conversation with Florence and how she was hospitalized for a month in a mental institute while having psychosis, the word mania feels so far away and unreachable.

Before I was first diagnosed a couple of years ago, I remember posting a picture of me sitting at a table in Argana, arching my fingers over the wood and smiling directly to whoever was behind the camera. The caption below the picture said: Male version of me; he's hot.

Tonight I felt the urge to look for a picture of 10 years younger. I found one standing in front of the ruins of somewhere in Spain. My hair is just as black; shorter, but not too much. There is dark facial hear around my mouth, which is arched in a subtle but warm smile. My eyes are smaller, but the difference is barely noticeable; present yet so faint that you can only perceive something different without being able to locate its origin. I contrasted that picture with one more than 120 months in the future. I am standing somewhere in this apartment, wearing a blouse in a red only a couple shades away from the previous one. My skin seems softer, a delicate softness that is apparent as a lighter tone. My eyes seem fuller and rounder. Unlike in my previous life, there I don't care for subtleties; my smile is full, overbearing with intention. Despite being a decade older, there is an aura of youth around me.

"Radiant", was how Sonny described me.

I, just like a couple of years ago, felt tempted to share this stark contrast.

Who looks older?

Last night, Florence shared with me her intimate and personal story of having aborted a pregngny from an Australian trans woman. I can't remember now if I was thinking of her, of my own Monica, when touched myself under the sheets. Maybe it was about the preambles of my first kiss with Alexia, or the usual fantasy of what would have happened had I kissed the woman of the couple with whom I was cuddling on her couch. The fantasy evolves to me accepting the advances of her partner. I grab him without letting go of his girlfriend. I turned towards him and start kissing him. I rub his chest while her hands are on my body. I unzip his pants and start following with my mouth the path that hands had just walked. I was not thinking of Florence nor her trans partner before I reached my orgasm. It was not until I felt the clear and warm liquid that stained my cheats and wet my fingers, that they came to my mind.

I woke up early in the morning. I attributed it to the alcohol my lack of capacity to go back to sleep despite being 7h. I was on my phone. I replied to some texts, maybe Sonny's maybe Alda's.

It was later in the morning. I was just starting to wash the dishes before starting to brew my iced coffee. I was on a call with Sonny. Clara's name showed up in a red notification on the top of my screen. The first words that I unintentionally read made me lose my breath. My mind stopped in the middle of a thought as I just stopped speaking. Another notification followed. I left the soaped up dishes and walked towards my room when a third one came.

I didn't want to open them. Instead I refreshed the story of what had happened to Sonny.

With the context that I could infer from the half-messages that I was able to read by the shooting notifications, my worry of an outright rejection was almost completely dissipated.

I don't remember if I was still on the call with Sonny, when I dared to fully read what Clara had said.

"...really reactive [...] unfortunately this weekend i have a friend visiting from California, trying to juggle between this and work, i'm not sure i would have some time left tho i would have loved seing you.

"i'll let you know about like sunday maybe, but can't promise," she continued, as if she wanted to avoid a rejection.

Throughout the day I have been trying to work, but I have not been able to successfully hold my focus.

"me tome mis pastillas hace como 45 minutos y ya me estoy empezando a sentir mal", said one of the texts that I sad Majo a couple of minutes ago.

I was tempted to order a couple of A&W burgers, but instead decided to eat a second pita with hummus and bologna. The last pita bread had a green spot of mold. I considered again the idea of ordering, before thinking about using a couple of corn tortillas instead. They were damp in a liquid that I didn't quite trust. Fortunately, I found a bag of instantaneous soup on my counter. Now I'll have another bowl of it, before going to pass out on my bed

### Saturday, November 16th, 2024

"Yeah I’d love to. Thinking about you now cause I quickly went to support a friend doing stand up in a Mexican place, everything is in Spanish and I’m the only persona non Latina, experiencing your church feeling tonight."  I walked up to the pharmacy and noticed a gray fence blocking the entrance. I was confused until I noticed the times posted by the door. Weekends closing hours are 18h. This might be the first night skipping a dose.

Despite going to bed relatively early last night, I couldn't get out of bed before noon.

Miriam said she would be picking me up at 15h. I postponed the alarm until 13h, giving me plenty of time to shower and get ready. After coming out of the bathroom and putting on my clothes I had still time left to make and drink an iced coffee.

I wore the black t-shirt from my trip to Puerto Vallarta a couple of years ago, and a thin pullover from back when I used to be a teenager. The combination of the padless bralette and the fitting racerback shirt made my chest look flat.

Last night, as I was in bed, under the covers and with the lights dimmed of, I got the notification of two new messages from Clara. I took a screenshot of the notifications and sent them to Majo. A few hours ago, she sent me a reel of two women hugging with the caption No solo ilusionaste a mi amiga, nos ilusionaste a las dos porque yo viví su historia como si fuera la mía.

I haven't received a text from Clara letting me now if she'll have time to meet tomorrow. I don't know anymore if I want to receive that message that I was looking forward to. I had gotten home from my platonic date with Miriam. I saw a story from Alex with his—I suppose—partner at Centre Bell. I replied to it asking if they were in Montréal. Unlike the girls I date, he replied almost instantly. We exchanged a couple of messages and he let me know they'd stay here until Monday morning.

"Que vas a hacer mañana en la nochi?"

I thought about how free second-half of Sunday that was conveniently left empty for a potential date that would probably not happen. My reply last night to Clara had been seen a couple of hours before. There were no messages under it.

"estaba quedando con alguien mañana, pero no se hizo nada. estás/están libres??"

I will meet them around Old Port by around 19h. I will have plenty of time after my brunch with Sarah in the late morning. She sent me a quick and subtle confirmation text this evening.

I had realized after my date with Florence that I don't want to meet any new people. I sent a message to the newest match that appeared on my Tinder. Her bio ended with I love hot nerds.

"i am a nerd, i am kinda hot, and i am ready to be loved."

Almost as quick as her first reply did the conversation finally died.

Miriam picked me up 20 minutes after 15h. We parked the car close to Dieu du ciel. We walked to La drogheria fine, and ordered two boxes of gnocchi. I think they overcharged her, but said nothing. We continued our conversation as we walked towards the park in front of Siboire. She told me about how she lived in Querétaro. She talked about her son. When we finished our cheap meals, we decided to go to the Cinema and wait there until 17h30, when the shorts would start.

She was unsure whether ordering alcohol or not. I told her that I would have it if she did, but I had no problem drinking something else. She must have debated the idea in her own head before deciding to get a cider. We got two glasses of the house cider. She also paid for them. We took our drinks to the high table bar and she continued telling me the story of how she got to know Misael.

The second half of our conversation in the cinema consisted in her updating me about the guy she was seeing for a year and with whom she met the night we came back from Ottawa. We went inside to the theater, grabbed our seats, and she finished telling me how she had decided to stop seeing him.

The shorts were not good. I enjoyed only the second one, Gender Reveal. The director came afterwards and answered a couple of questions. When we got back to her car, I asked her to leave me by the metro station since I needed to pick up my medication at the pharmacy. We said our good-byes and I told her to update me about her date tomorrow with the French guy.

As I am finishing this words, I got the idea of taking my camera next time I see Clara and asking her to take a picture of me.

"cuando lo de clara no se de, vamos a sufrir las dos" was my reply to Majo's reel.

### Tuesday, November 19th, 2024

"Are free anytime this weekend?

"You*"  Fabiola suggested me to give writing another try. I started our session by telling her how these past few days I have not been feeling that great. I did not go to the office neither today nor yesterday. Both days I found it really hard to get out of bed.

I skipped my dosis Saturday night. I met with Sarah Sunday morning. We met outside Le toasteur. The wait was going to be an hour, so she took my offer of getting a coffee beforehand at Café Nocturne. I told her my story of being stood up and curing my hungover at that same place.

We chatted and had our late breakfast. I walked her to her car by Parc Jarry. We talked about meeting again some time before my departure next month. On my way back to my apartment, I passed by the pharmacy to finally pick up my medication.

I don't remember if I wrote about it, but I met with Alex. I saw his story with his partner at Centre Bell and after slightly catching up, we agreed to meet Sunday evening. I proposed Brewsky. It was the first time either of us saw each other since College. I enjoyed talking with him much more than I thought I would.

Miriam texted me asking how my date had been. I asked her about her coffee date with her French guy. "No me gustó," she told me. "Todo me dice que ahorita le pare y me enfoque en los negocios."

Coming back from my second platonic date, after promosing him that I would send him my journal entry of my night with Bea, I grabbed my laptop and took it with me to bed. Instead of writing about our chat, I went in and edited it a bit more. I uploaded the pdf to Google Drive and sent him the link. Yesterday—or maybe today—he liked the message as a mark of appreciation.

Yesterday was a day that I completely lost.

I did try to work. I sat down at the computer and continued working on my scripts. I progressed. I still felt like I failed.

I had no food and lacked the energy to put on clothes for going outside to get groseries. I ordered myself a pizza, justifying the high price with the fact that it would serve me for three or even four days.

I don't want to write about Nicola and how she liked me on hinge, forgetting that we had met and gone out on a date two or three years ago. I don't want to write either about Isabelle—is that even her name?—with whom I exchanged instagram accounts after she apologized for not responding to my texts. have u had the time to stalk the old pics in my profile or was it just me?

I feel the sadness creeping up in the corners, like the little mice that have sneakily eaten all of the peanut butter that I put in the traps. In my session I briefly talked about the idea of being a mother or a father.

"im not sure but i think my first kiss could have been considered sexual assault"

The subject seemed to come up again. Majo started talking about one of her friend talking about how her last date had been so attentive and caring, by walking her to the metro. We started talking about gender expectations, and their difference in homosexual relationships compared to straight ones. Aliza brought up the safety issue, which led me to mention how I overtrust my dates because they are women.

I did not bring the subject up to Fabiola. I remember how the last time that I thought about this and mentioned it to Sonny, I intentionally left it out or avoided going into detail when I wrote about that day in the journal. Right now, again, I seem to be doing everything to walk around it.

Aliza asked me how old we were. I told her I don't really remember. I had not reached puberty, and neither of them either. They played putting on a lipstick that smelled rancid to me. I felt uneasy even before they started. They both got over me and I couldn't move away. I don't remember feeling their lips even though they both kissed me all over my face and neck. The only thing I remember is the smell. Would it not count anymore if they missed my lips?

### Sunday, November 24th, 2024

"I thought about it, but wasn't sure, on our first date. I knew it after the second. And, now, right now, I really, really want to kiss you."  A couple of days ago, Majo brought up a recent conversation she had with Aliza. She said she would tell me everything the next time we would see each other. I might have been coming back from working at Oui mais non.

I asked her what were her plans for the next day, Saturday, yesterday. She was supposed to meet some friends, but that was supposed to happen at night. I offered her to meet me before and I could buy her the coffee that I owed her for giving me the idea of my third date with Clara.

Earlier in the week, I double-texted her telling her about a current LGBT film-festival—the one that Majo had just told me about—there were a couple of movies that caught my eye. One on Friday and the other on Saturday at 21h. She replied back less than an hour later, saying that she would love to go with me, Saturday would work better, and that we could meet a bit before. A couple of days later, she finalized the plan by asking me if meeting at 19h30 would work for me.

I suggested Majo to meet at 15h, somewhere around Berri-Uqam or place-des-arts. That same morning, we changed our plans to meet at 14h.

I finished getting ready. I wore a black denim skirt over black tights and a blue over-sized top. I put on eyeliner and a subtle eyeshadow. Last minute, I decided to open a new set of contacts. I confessed to Majo that I felt displeased with how I was looking. She told me she would let me know after seeing me. I was aware that my over-consciousness came from an irrational place and was not-based in reality.

I put my camera inside my purse and took it with me. I talked with Majo about my impulse of asking Clara to take a picture of me. Although I was not convinced of actually doing that, since Majo would be seeing her friends, I could kill some time by trying to finish the roll in those free hours before meeting Clara.

Majo and I went to Lola Rosa. We shared a poutine. We stayed a couple of hours in the restaurant. Lately we have been seeing each other quite frequently and for long periods of time. She told me that I looked good, pretty. By that point, my distasteful insecurity had downgraded to a faint indifference.

We stayed around the area, walking around complexe desjardins. For a while we stayed sitting by the christmas tree looking at the children play with balloons around it. There was a baby that we jokingly referred to as bebé señora.

We talked about my date. A couple of days ago, Majo told me that she believed I should not concern myself with telling Clara about me being trans, and instead focus on disseminating how I really feel about her.

A guy passed by and looked at me from head to toes. Majo noticed him first. Even now, as I am writing this, I am not sure how exactly do I feel with this idea of being seen and not being sure of the intention behind being noticed.

Majo's friend arrive and Majo introduced us. She was coming from a date, also her third. We went to Le central and sat down by an indian spot. A bit later, another friend of theirs joined us.

At around 19h15, I stood up and started heading to Berri-UQAM. I opened Clara's conversation on instagram 13 minutes later. Three gray dots let me know that she also had the conversation open on her end. My message appeared first stating that I was inside the station, at the very center of it, sitting on the only available place to sit. Then it was hers, letting me know she was waiting for the metro to come here.

Around 15 minutes later she arrived. We hugged. I considered the idea of kissing her on the cheek, but decided not to. We went outside and walked by the village looking for a place to drink something. We passed by la graine brûlée and I mentioned it was a café that I liked which had coffee, tea, and even drinks. We considered going in, but I let her take the choice. I argued that I had picked our activity and the movie, it was her turn to decide. We continued walking.

Somewhen in our walk she noticed a limousine waiting by the red light. I told her about quinceañeras in Mexico, and how it's really normal for 15 year old girls and their chambelanes to ride them before their party celebrating turning into women.

"Did you have one?" she asked me.

I hesitated before replying. "No," I said as a half-truth.

"You did not become a woman?"

"I became a woman in quite a different way."

We got to the next metro station before we decided to head back. None of the bars looked appetizing. We returned to the first proposed café. We grabbed each a can of a cocktail, she got herself a brownie. By the cashier, there were two shots next to the question ce que vous prefereriez: One had a piece of paper that said ne plus jamais tomber amoroux. And the other ne plus jamais baiser.

I took that philosophical question and used it as a spark for our conversation. She said that not falling in love again would be too sad. I counter-argued that it would be horrible being in love with someone and not being able to have sex with them.

We walked back to UQAM and got into the theater where they would project the movie. She left to pee and I stayed waiting for her. I noticed a familiar face in a small group of people to my right. She was a woman whom I have seen on the apps. I was not sure if we ever talked or even matched.

As we waited to get in, Clara asked me if I had preferences concerning where to seat in the theaters. I said that as long as it wasn't the first rows, I did not really mind. I returned the question to her, and she told me how she likes seating on the very ends, in case she has to get out for an emergency or something.

"That is called anxiety, love."

We got in and struggled to find to connecting available seats. We scouted for them and ended running to the front rows to grab two on the opposite end of the hall. I graciously offered her the aisle seat. Both of us followed my idea of putting our coats on the back of our seats.

During the movie I kept thinking about reaching over to her seat. Sometimes I wanted to put gently my hand on her thigh, but her legs were crossed and pointing to the other direction. Other times I wanted to stroke her arm and arriving on her hand, grabbing it, but her hands were busy holding themselves. I just laid my arm on our shared armrest and waited for her.

By the end of the movie, her elbow and full arm were positioned right next to mine. I felt the warmth of her body through her pink sweatshirt. We stayed in that position during the Q&A with the director.

When the questions ended, I patted her thigh and looked her in the eye as I said, "I have to ask you something."

She looked at me serious and expecting me to continue. I held her sight as I grabbed my coat and started it putting it on while we slowly stood up.

"Right now?" she said, trying to figure out what I was going to ask.

"Yes," I started. "Can you take me to the restrooms."

"Sofía, you are so dramatic."

We walked back to the metro station. We went inside and were looking for the way to our direction. I asked her if she was hungry, referring back to a funny moment where a grumbling sound came from her stomach and she apologized. She said she could eat. I offered her to look for some place. It was close to midnight, yet she did not disregard my attempt to prolong our goodbye.

She proposed a pub close to her house and by the metro station. We rode the metro and got off at station Beaubien. We got there and double-checked in the maps that it would close at 2h. When we got inside, the waitress warned us that the kitchen was going to close soon. We shared a small bag of fries. She got herself a lager and I a glass of cider.

I told her my rehearsed speech of having two available secrets and letting her choose one.

"On one hand, I have option tea. On the other, there's option Kafe, but with a K, like in German."

She picked option K, so I confessed my desire to kiss her. She smiled surprised, but kept herself from saying me too in any form, either verbal or not.

"So, what about option T?"

I asked her if she wanted all the build-up or just saying it straight up. She picked the former.

I told her how I did not know if she knew already, but now I thought not. I told her how my friend had told me not to tell her, actually. I might have made a reference to the quinceañera conversation we had, but she did not remember the term, and thus, missed the connection. So, I just said it. "It's that I am trans."

We continued talking about it for a bit. She just nodded, as a signal of understanding. I kept myself from asking, in any form, verbal or not, so, is it an issue for you?

Later, I asked her, "but, what about you? on which date did you first want to kiss me?"

"Well," she smiled again. "I'm not sure. Perhaps this one, maybe not."

"Yeah? maybe a future one?"

We kept looking straight at each other and smiling.

We paid our bills and put on our coats. I asked her which directions would she head out to. She pointed to the left. For me, I would have to take the night bus, since it was past 1h, which was to the right. We headed outside to the cold night. I looked her straight in her blueish green eyes, waiting. She smiled fully and asked me what was it. I laughed and lied by saying "nothing."

She offered me to walk me to the bus. I reaffirmed her that she really did not have to.

"It's OK," she insisted. "I can walk with you, and just not wait until it passes."

I understood she was buying time, before either deciding if she wanted to kiss me, or gathering the will to do it.

We saw the bus that she would take back to her house pass. When we got to the metro station, I offered her to go inside and see if another one was going to pass. In my phone, I saw there was still another metro towards Montmorency. I had 10 minutes.

I brought up again le festival triste next Saturday, but after confirming its time, she let me know it would be impossible for her to attend. I asked her if we could see each other again before our departures in December.

"Yes, yes, absolutely," she said so sure of herself leaving me no space for doubt to set in.

"So, you said something about kissing me."

"Yeah, I think I did," I said back smiling, excited for what was about to happen next.

I forgot exactly her words that made me tease her with "you don't sound very convinced."

Her smile did not go away, as she said, "non, non; I really want to."

I walked towards her and put my hand in her puffy arm over her purple coat. I felt her lower lip first. We continued kissing as she put her fingers in my now messy hair. I got closer until I felt the warmth of her thigh. I started smiling without pulling away.

I saw her slowly pulling away and opening her eyes.

"That was nice," she said smiling. We said our good-byes and she started walking away.

"I will see you," were her last words before she left and I entered the metro station to catch the last train home.

### Wednesday, November 27th, 2024

 Por años, el rojo fue mi color favorito.  Qué ingenua;  ¿cómo podría comparar el fuego y el vino  con la cálida bienvenida de  su mirada turquesa e infinita,  incendiada en la luz ámbar de la madrugada?

Ofrecí venderle un secreto.  Qué ingenua;   ¿cómo podría guardar cualquier misterio  si, al mirarme así y sin decir nada,  el océano inquieto de sus ojos  me desarma, me desnuda y me vuelve a vestir?   I got sick after Saturday. Sunday I started with a tingling bad omen in my throat. The next morning, I replied to an email to the lab letting them know that it would be impossible for me to join the lab meeting. I slept most of the day.

A sore throat turned into cough which then turned into allergy symptoms.

This morning Aliza practiced her candidacy presentation in a Zoom call with Majo and me. I woke up at around 7h. I showered and walked to the bakery to buy myself a croissant for breakfast. I had it with a large mug of coffee sitting down at my desk not working.

Aliza is more ready than a couple of weeks ago. I think she will do fine. Probably even better than how I did.

We dropped the call and I got back to my coding. I haven't been able to be productive all week. I need to have something ready to show Louis tomorrow, especially if I intend to tell him about my flight in two weeks.

I am wearing my mustard pants with a white button-up under a wine-coloured sweater. When she saw me, Aliza asked me if I had dressed up to go to the lab or if I was just overly-dressed to stay home. I did not tell her—I think—that I have a date with Sarah tonight.

Is it really a date?

I thought about cancelling. I had reason enough to do it. I did not.

A couple of days ago I let Clara know that I had gotten sick and was worried about being contagious. She non-chalantly disregarded my worries by saying that, being the flu season, she would be getting sick one way or another.

I did not let it go and brought up explicitly my insecurity by mentioning our kiss. I regretted my response shortly after sending it and considered deleting it. It remained unseen for a complete day. To this moment, it is unacknowledged.

I told Majo about my regret and she asked me about it. I told her I was embarrased and would prefer not to let her know its contents. It was as if keeping it a secret I could avoid the responsability of it.

I opened up this dairy thinking about how I haven't written in it all week. I drafted a short poem at the top, as an epilogue. After finishing a wave of dread washed over me. An intense urge to run away shocked my legs. Going away, escaping. I texted Majo about how I felt the urge to ignore the inexistent message that I did not receive from Clara, how I wanted to actively avoid seeing her in the next few weeks and to force me to calm down my potentially uncontrolable and unwarranted emotions.

She asked me where I was. After I told her I was still in my apartment, she offered to call me. We talked for a bit about how I am feeling. I confessed how I am scared by the intensity of my infatuation.

"The kiss did not make it better," she said somewhere in our conversation.

A couple of days ago I posted a story on instagram of the pink book I borrowed from the library. Next to it was the pink mug that Paty had given me. I made no mention of it, despite intentionally including it in the frame. Paty took my bait and sent me a short but direct acknowledgment. Amo.

As if it meant anything, I avoided opening the conversation like a payback for the many times that my messages were left as castaways. Yesterday, I posted another story with a similar intention, but different objective.

For some reason, immediately after posting a second one referencing my trip to Mexico, I hid it from Clara's eyes. But, Paty saw it. She reached out, again, asking me if I was coming to Mexico once again.

This morning—or was it last night?—I replied to her.

Misael added me to a group chat with information about his birthday party on the 14th. Curious, I went to the newborn chat's list of members, with the explicit intention of seeing how many people I would recognize, and the preconscious urge of looking for a specific name in there.

### Thursday, November 28th, 2024

 Los he visto parar el tiempo al curvarse en un gesto.  He probado de ellos el futuro en un beso sabor a promesa.

Pero de tus labios, lo que más me fascina,  es cuando dibujan sobre la noche mi nombre en un susurro.   I did not go to the office today either. I will not go tomorrow filling the week in absences.

I have worked, but not as much as I should. I have completely disregarded by now the idea of finishing my third manuscript before the Christmas break. I confessed to Louis this as well as my departure from Montréal in the next couple of weeks.

Before my meeting with Louis, as I was opening my emails looking for any updates, I was surprised by Melissa's name and her two-year-old answer to one of my emails birthed from a manic-induced project.

She talks about catching up with old emails provoked by the need of cleaning up memory. She longs for a delete forever option that would work in her own mind. Her message ends with a provoking sign-off:

Te pregunto, ¿lograste aceptarte y quererte?

"have i not grown up in two years?" I reached out to Majo.

For some reason, I opened instagram on my web browser and started threading through old stories. I saw my hair change, grow and get shorter. I saw the different memes that referenced particular moments of my past, like inside jokes for myself let out teasing about a private life held off from the unknowing parties.

"Sientes que sí o no?" says Majo's text.

"not sure" was the only thought I got.

This morning I have been talking with Paty. I had replied a story of hers on which she poses with a dress in front of a mirror before going to a Belanova concert. She wanted to know if my shock was good or bad. I just said that I thought it might have been the first time I saw her in a dress. She proved me wrong with a picture of a group of us posing at one of Yaaj's events. I replied taking responsability of my own error with a picture of her of that same day walking up the stage to introduce somebody for something. Both pictures were from the event on which we openly flirted with each other, on which we broke the touch barrier and she leaned on my shoulder several times throughout the night. It was the same night when she said the famous words Ay Sofía, sólo porque tengo novia, sino, súper sí.

I told her about seeing her one day during the week that I will stay in Mexico City. I mentioned having something to give her, despite me not having bought anything yet. I kept flirting with her in the following texts before we actually set in stone the intentions of seeing each other by ourselves.

¿Ahora, de nuevo, vas a volver a dejarme ir sin besarme?

Tomorrow is Aliza's candidacy exam. She told us about going to a bar somewhere by Atwater at night after she goes to Temple. I am still undecided if I will go or not. Majo, on the other hand, is sure that she will skip it.

Earlier I shared with Alda my idea of a potential second game I could propose to Clara. When I fantasized about sharing a bottle of wine as a date in my apartment, the other part of it consisted in playing We are not really strangers. I asked her if it would be possible to borrow it from her, and if she believed it would be a good idea. She answered affirmatively to both of my queries.

When I mentioned it to Majo, she had another insightful observation.

"Wey, pero o sea, justo eso habiamos hablado. Que con amigas, a usted no le molesta hacer cosas; o no sobre-piensa todas las acciones que quiere hacer; pero, con la gente que usted quiere como pareja, o como algo, duda de cada acción y que eso induce tal vez más ansiedad."

She finished suggesting that maybe I should treat Clara more like a friend. Because she is also that, not only a—potential—partner, but also a friend.

I told her I disagreed. I argued that, despite having things in common, a friend's love is characterized as it not being born from desire.

We then changed the topic, when I told her about Melissa's email.

Several times I wanted to tell her, but decided not to, that I have been writing poetry and using chatGPT to translate it into French, to get an idea of how she would read it.

### Friday, November 29th, 2024

 I felt a quiet sadness after I wrote you a poem in my language, one you don't understand.  Then, I was struck by how much more beautiful it reads in yours, a language I cannot speak.   I haven't replied to Melissa's mail.

I just got home from Aliza's post-candidacy exam night at the bar. She asked us to meet her at 21h45 after her going to Temple. Majo had told me she was not thinking of going. I was still undecided until this afternoon.

I did not sleep very well. At 3h I drafted a story after editing some old pictures I found in my archive. The first one said: I wonder if I write poems of people I have just met for the same reason I like take photographs of people who do not know me. It was the picture of the blonde young women sitting on a bench in the small baie by San Diego's airport. I took it with Sonny's camera at the exact moment she turned towards me. The moment exacerbates the cheapness and lack of controls in the plastic camera, which results in a dream-like blurriness. The second one, a black-and-white shot of a man sitting down framed by the pilars of somewhere inside Central Park, has the following conclusion: Perhaps there is a particular beauty in creating art from complete strangers.

There was a third one that I worked on, but decided not to post. It was a shot taken by Sonny of a subway train leaving one of the stations. The coloured filter and lack of light gives it a touch that I found emotional and nostalgic. In the text framing this snapshot, I directly referenced both of the poems that I wrote these past nights, and the division marked by the language barrier; the impossibility of sharing a deep personal part of myself in a way that can be completely percieved.

Lastly, I edited a picture of a mural of a pair of children; the boy holding a bouquet of flowers behind his back, and the girl in front of him a mace enlaced in nails. I titled the picture Amor y defensas.

I fell asleep some time before 5h. I had some failed attempts of waking up on which I looked at the phone to see the number of people who had seen my intimate midnight sharings. I was not satisfied until I saw Clara's name in the list. The next time that  I grabbed my phone, the notification with her name of it was about new messages in our conversation. She started by wishing me a speedy recovery to my healthiest self and reassured me that her potential sickness might be more a sign of her hypochondria. She apologized again about not being a quick responder and mentioned an unexpected issue with her apartment. Then, she went back like she's has been doing since our first date and liked both my second story and my posted picture. Did she suspect that my poem referenced her? Would she feel flattered or threatened? Was I hoping for her to mention it in our conversation or to ask me directly?

She has not replied back. I told myself that, regardless of whether she replies or not, I'll reach out tomorrow again, possibly asking her about her peruvian's friend lunch and maybe offering her information about the sad short films, but definitely asking her about our last date of the year.

I met with Alda in the early afternoon, after finishing the second half of vegetabe soup I cooked this week. We went to a couple of shops looking for a cute detail to buy for Paty and Misael. She wanted to get something for Sonny, too.

One of the stores was Indigo, on which I bought myself a French book, despite just a couple of days before telling Sarah that I had decided not to buy books again and instead getting them out of the library. I considered getting a black mug with two—one red and another blue—mixtapes. It was a bit cheaper than the previous option I found at Urban Outfitters, a white and black taller cup that had several motifs that reminded me of her.

Jokingly, when I was texting Majo, I told her that my idea was of getting a postcard from Montreal and writing on it: A mi crush que más años ha durado. Siempre (casi) tuya, S.

I finished the joke with the idea of signing with the lipstick outline of a kiss. But, that second part was actually a

## December, 2024

### Tuesday, December 3rd, 2024

 I miss the idea I built of you.   It's been sneaking in for a couple of days, but I was expecting this since almost two months ago. It was long due.

I went yesterday to the office after skipping the whole week. I was sick for most of it, but it did not stop me from actually going outside the house. I met Alda to go pick up a gift for Paty, I met with Aliza to celebrate her passed candidacy exam, I went with Majo to make use of the two tickets I bought for the festival triste.

Today, I stayed home for both my sessions with the psychiatrist and with Fabiola.

"I... I don't feel depressed yet, but I feel it coming. I think I'd like to increase the dose."

He looked as if he was faking a face of compassion and understanding. We went from 150mg to 200mg. I received the call from the pharmacy and I requested to have the six weeks and the other month of my hormones and antiandrogens. That would be precisely enough to last me the whole winter break.

I do not remember if it was before my session with Fabiola or after, that I heated some beef and rice for breakfast. When I took out the tupperware containers from the fridge I noticed the months old cans of beer and cider. Have I really not drunk at home in all this time?

I feel tempted to grab one. Even the water bottle filled with Albanian liquor that Alda brought me from her last trip home feels appetizing.

"How about your romantic life?" asked me Fabiola after I said that everything has been going well at the office and with my friends.

Do I want to write in here how before this sentence I stopped writing and went for two sips of raki? I opened the fridge and realized that it was only a deceiving wrapper rather than a leftover can of cider. I considered grabbing the older—and much stronger—beer. I have to leave in an hour. I do not think I will be able to finish it nor that it would be a good idea to arrive at Aliza's noticeably drunk.

Yesterday, rather than sadness or melancholy, I was in an easily-distractable and irritable mood. I got angry with Sonny when, after I had repeatedly told her to just give me a quantity to deposit her, she started over-explaining again after giving me an initial number which I finish transferring by the moment she was in the middle of arguing for me to send her more money. I realized I was not rational, and thus I told her it would be better if we stopped talking. Later that night I apologized by telling her that I was aware I was not being fair, but I still did not want to speak.

Thursday Aliza proposed me to go to her house to put her up to date with my latest dating phase. I guess by now it is over. I have deleted my Tinder account and hid my Hinge one. Both apps are no longer in my phone. I will not be seeing Sarah again this year, and probably it will be the same with Clara.

It was probably the night between Saturday and Sunday, when she replied to latest messages that I had sent her earlier that same night asking her about her peruvian friend's food and sharing about the short films. She told me the details she had omitted about her latest housing problems. She continued talking about her long night working that same day and finishing with a question about the shorts, half-way twisting it to a request for recommendations. I had my phone in my hands and saw each message come up live. I hesitated but replied immediately. Both my responses that night and the message I sent her yesterday asking her if she would have a free evening this week are unseen.

As soon as I sent the latter, I regretted it.

Her latest messages were both a long vent—her own words, not mine—about her roommates and how they need to find two rather than just one replacements, and here long working hours. And my response was asking her to see me. It is not just selfish, but tone-deaf. I deserve to remain ignored.

I lost count of how many times I have muted and unmuted her conversation.

I start feeling the raki warming up my face.

### Wednesday, December 4th, 2024

 I shut close the drapes and turned off the lights.  I took cover under the cold sheets, hiding myself  from the coming storm within me.   I woke up early enough that I could have gone to the office. I turned off the alarm instead.

In my calendar I had but a single event. Today was a talk about the process of submitting the thesis. It was scheduled to start at noon. I barely made it.

I made myself a glass of coffee with the last paper filter I had left. I sipped it while I half-heard someone talk about the steps I would need to follow in the upcoming year.

I don't remember if it was before or after the talk that I shut off my phone.

The only light inside my apartment is the desk lamp behind this dark screen. Even if the curtains were open, it is dark outside despite being still too early to drink.

I ran out of fingers to count the times I have cried today.

I had something to eat, so my stomach was not empty when I went back again to the reused water bottle almost filled with Alda's Albanian rakia.

I feel the warm fruity breath with every sip I take.

Last night I drank enough that when I tried to speak at the pharmacy, my words would drag and stumble upon themselves. I sent a text to Majo confessing I was drunk before even getting to Aliza's. Her worry urged her to call me. I declined her call and lied saying I was alright.

I do not know if it was noticeable enough for Aliza.

We had plans, María and I, to meet today after work. I cancelled on her. I postponed it to tomorrow. I asked her to buy coffee filters for me, maybe unconsciously pushing me to actually meet with her tomorrow.

A couple of hours ago, when I turned the phone and got out of bed, I grabbed Albert Camus' book and started reading it. I had not yet started drinking. By now, I have probably drunk more than last night. I do not know if I am trying to hide from my emotions or push them out.

There are, here and then, small murmurs coming through my headphones, interrupting the background music I put to drown my thoughts. I do not know where they are coming from.

Last night, Aliza and I ate burgers at her house. I got myself a poutine with mine. After talking about the girls I have gone out on dates these past few months that she was busy with her school work, she reciprocated by telling me in her words what I have been intuiting regarding Steph.

I do not know if she noticed I am starting to drown or I was already self-medicating with alcohol. I suspected María might have warned her. When I asked her directly, she denied it. I have no reason to doubt her.

I turned back on my phone. I could not last more than a couple of hours. It has not loaded yet, and I am feeling anxious about the idea of everything remaining empty. No new messages, no new notifications or unreceived messages. An absence that nobody noticed. A tree that fell in the forest without making any sound.

I keep drifting off—from these words, from my own feelings, from reality?—but I am back.

I scanned two or three rolls. I watched the first half-an-hour of Lucía y el sexo. I got drunk with the memories of my last kiss and little sips of alcohol from an old water bottle.

Last time I turned on my phone I had the picture from Sonny for the transference to Misael. There are some reels or images in the conversation with Majo and Aliza, maybe another one in the María's.

I am not sure if the Christmas lunch is tomorrow or Friday. I think it is the 6th. Tomorrow I will meet with Louis and then with María. The day after I will go to the lab's lunch and will probably have a good-enough time. Next week I will be waking up in another bed. The week after I will go back to not sleeping alone.

Have I run out of tears already? Or are they just hidden from me.

Why am I thinking about motherhood?

Why are the faceless children I dreamed of, with curly and blonde hair, coming to me now?

I am not capable of making life; only death resides within me.

### Sunday, December 8th, 2024

 I reach for the night we invented love, but the stars blur, their edges unspoken.  A memory fading between dream and shadow, a moment unraveling in silence, its heartbeat dimmed, its warmth scattered like ashes.  Tell me—did you feel it too, this quiet undoing?  Or is it only me, grieving a ghost I can no longer hold?   I am waiting right now.

I am waiting a couple of months before my PhD defense; a couple of days to travel to Mexico and see my friends, my family, my dog again; an hour before walking to station Jarry to meet with Clara and bring her to my place.

Earlier this week she told me of the possibility of meeting Saturday—yesterday—if her long-planned trip to Quebed were not to happen. She explained it probably wouldn't. My replies to her text remained unseen the following days. I tried to convince myself that whatever happened, whether I saw her or not before January would be alright. I went to bed Friday with the sketch of hope about waking up in the morning and reading her text proposing a time. When I looked at my phone throughout the morning, it always remained empty.

I was venting with Majo about my disappointment and sadness and even irritation. She asked me what was it that made me upset.

"cuz it takes 10 secs to write sorry, i can't saturday/tomorrow/today; or not just that, opening the conversation.

"i feel like an afterthought, and i deserve more than that."

It probably was not more than an hour before the notification came. She laughed at the photography reel I had send her, and told me how she had just seen it the day before and thought about me. Then, she said her trip to Quebec had not happen as expected, so we could do something chill at around 6 or 7 if I were still down for it.

I told her to meet me at Station Jarry at 7. She confirmed it, and I continued with my day.

There was still a sense of uneasyness, something didn't sit well within me.

It might have been the night before. I was thinking about my plans for our date—were it to happen. I thought about the questions game that Alda and I used to play. You see, the point of the game is to come up with unanswerable questions; something so deep or personal, that you rather lose a point than to share an answer. As a follow-up thought, I thought of examples of potential questions.

How was the time you lost your virginity?

I was lying on my bed, face over my pillow and my body under the duvet. I froze.

"i just realized i can't remember when/how i lost my virginity, and words can't describe the sudden grief i am experiencing rn cuz of it."

Fifteen minutes before the alarm I had set on my phone to signal the time I would need to start getting my stuff to leave started singing, I got a voice message from Clara. Its length of almost a minute was the first bad sign.

"Hi Sofia," it started with a voice that despite easily recognizing, felt new and adventurous.

There were also tiredness and pain embroided in her words; that was the second bad sign.

She proposed an exchanged, maybe we could meet this afternoon rather than that night, go for a coffee or whatever I had planned. Of course, if I was not available, she would definitely make it, albeit just a bit later since she needed to sleep some more.

How could I dare to force her to see me, even if I were to have plans today?

"Thanks you are an angel" she finally said.

In less than 30 minutes she's supposed to be arriving.

This morning I reach out as promised and shared my plans for last night, and an alternative option referencing her mention of getting coffee. In the afternoon, she picked my original plans with the exception of the wine, and proposed meeting at 16h. My response confirming remains unopened.

I feel nervous. I feel still unconvinced that it is happening.

This is going to be our fourth date. I don't think I have ever come this far with anyone after Sonny.

What is it with women I have kissed that I rarely see them again?

I have listened to her audio several times. There is something sweet in how she pronounces my name.

"...and it makes me feel as if i'm the one who's been pronouncing it wrong all these years."
