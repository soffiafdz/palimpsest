***

I was sitting in the waiting area by my gate on the Philadelphia airport. After
barely sleeping on my red-eye flight, I felt melancholic, nostalgic, and easily
irritated. I looked at my phone screen as Clara's notifications kept appearing
one-by-one. She thanked me for the playlist I made for her titled
_Heartbreak hits for middle-aged women doing house chores_.

clarabelais > `i hope you have (had?) a nice trip back!`\
clarabelais > `also are you free friday night?`

I made it to Montréal after three—or was it four?—weeks in México. Passing by
immigration, instead of just waving me in like other years, they sent me to the
_Immigration 1_ room. It was not the same one where I had to present myself
4 years ago in order to defend my application for a study permit. It took me
around an hour and a half between waiting and explaining to the officer how in
a PhD I don't take courses nor have grades.

Exhausted, not long after arriving to my—thankfully already—place, I succumbed
unto my bed and put an end to a long two-sided day.

I decided not to go to the office and stay home. I called the bank to solve the
issue about the mistakenly disputed charges that lead them to blocking my
credit card; then I called the Wellness Hub to schedule an appointment with Dr
Franck to renew my soon-to-expire prescription; finally, I called Biron lab to
schedule an appointment to get my blood drawn since apparently there are no
more phlebotomists at McGill until further notice.

I solved all of those issues before discovering an unforeseen one. When I tried
to schedule my follow-up appointment with Dr Perera, the woman on the other
line informed me that Dr Perera had taken a maternity leave. A different
doctor would be taking over _my medical needs_ in the meantime, or, if needed,
refer me to somebody externally.

I thought back to when I learned that, from the four doctors that work at
McGill, only the absent Hashana was willing to oversee the HRT of trans
patients.

I had my rescheduled meeting with Louis and talked about the plans for the
following weeks.

Clara had proposed me two options for plans for last night. The first one was
a chill night at a games pub where we could play and drink some beers. The
second one was a readaptation of the one I had proposed before our departure:
a night of wine, pizza and winter socks.

I met her, again, at the exit of Station Jarry. This time, as a bookend of her
good-bye kiss outside my apartment back in December, I went to kiss her mouth
before hugging her. We walked back to my place talking about my adventure in
the airport.

She brought two bottles of wine, one red and one white, and a fridge magnet
from Rouen.

We spent most of the night lying down on my couch, in a close conversation
interrupting the mix of songs that kept playing in front of us by Youtube. As
the night went on and we kept refilling our glasses, we got closer to each
other. By midnight, she was fully reclined on my chest, wrapping the arm of the
hand that caressed her thigh with hers as if they were snakes.

"Obviously you can stay the night," I offered her. Several times throughout
the night I would flinch as she started talking, fearing she would let me know
it was her time to leave.

We did not move to my bed until after 2h.

Clara asked me if I had a side of the bed. After I said no, she picked the one
facing the window.

We changed in front of each other without modesty nor desire. I noticed her
tattoos on her arms and thigh and that she was not wearing a bra under her
sleeveless gray undershirt. I lend her the white leggings that I bought on my
last trip home.

Under the covers I continued reaching out to hold her. We both fell asleep
without kissing a second time in the night.

Around 4h, I got up and went to the toilette. Coming back, she echoed my
actions. I heard her hit the couch in the darkness and asked her if she was
alright as she joined me under the covers. I invited her in my arms again.
I started by kissing her cheek. Maybe it was two times. I reached out to her
face and pulled it to mine. I kissed her lips. The first one lead to the second
which lead to the third; each new one charged with intention and desire.
I repositioned myself on top of her. She received me by grabbing me by the
waist and opening her legs. We were kissing almost desperately when I asked
her if I could take off her clothes.

In the morning, I heard her whisper, _Sofi._ I woke up and my eyes searched for
her.

She informed me that she would be leaving in 10 minutes. She sit up with her
back on the headrest. I moved up and placed my head above her left breast.
She held me while she played pulling lone curls of my hair as I slept for the
remaining time I had with her.

The alarm clock started beeping and she used its singing as a signal for her
leaving. I walked her to the door of my apartment, accompanying her as she took
her stuff, then kissing her goodbye. I returned to bed and slept for almost all
of the remaning daylight.

I went to pick-up the traveller's notebook I ordered yesterday. Then I passed
by Metro to get some groceries.

I might be getting sick.

>soffiafdz > `well fuck`\
>soffiafdz > `it gets even worse`

***

I ate the last slice of margheritta pizza with two servings of undercooked
pasta. I refilled the half-drunk glass of red wine to sit down and write.

It was an exhausting weekend in several ways.

I woke up relatively early from the sunlight coming through the open drapes.
I grabbed the alarm clock and turned it off 25 minutes before it was supposed
to start. My first project of the day was to try to open up the malfunctioning
olympus pen that Miguel bought for me. The winding mechanism stopped working
correctly the first couple of days after putting in the first roll of Kodak
Gold 200. I tried it out in the small plaza when my mom asked me to buy her
some nachos while we were both waiting for Les to have her psychiatrist
appointment. I got stuck when I couldn't open up the lens. It turns out I do
need a lens wrench. It should be arriving tomorrow. For now, all the pieces are
organizedly scattered on my desktop, waiting.

The second chore was laundry. I washed the sheets—both the ones I took off
a month ago the weekend before my departure when Clara was first supposed to
come over and the second set we both slept on this weekend after I came back.
I also washed the contents of the full laundry basket filled with the clothes
I could not wash in Tijuana since the washer, like my camera, stopped working.

A recurring theme in my recent therapy sessions is the anxiety of not being
able to access my HRT. The plan ahead was fairly straightforward; Dr Perera
would give me a year-long prescription to bridge the period before my referral
to endocrinology. Today I saw a story from transpatients in Instagram. The
first one I saw was a response stating that the only physician offering trans
care was going to be absent soon. I did not realize that it was a response to
their 1-day old post talking about Dr Perera's maternity leave.

>_As of late Dec 2024, Dr. Perera is on leave until Jan 2026. Dr Perera is the
>only doctor at the McGill Student Wellness Hub providing hormone replacement
>therapy and surgery recommendation letters to patients. The TPU is very
>disappointed that while Dr. Perera is on leave, there will be no doctors at

There was a comment under the post, from one of the patients affected by this.
They mentioned that when they called the Hyega clinic to make an appointment,
they were informed that because of the long waitlist, the closest available day
was in November. I won't be a student by then anymore.

This weekend I started researching about monotherapy with injectable oestrogen.
A single vial that can last around a year costs between 65 and 85 USD. There is
a store that ships from the US. A vial of estrogen cypionate, including the
shipping to Canada would cost me 115 USD. There is a small risk of it being
intercepted and held at customs. I thought about ordering several vials to my
father's PO box. I could pay a week-long round trip to pick it up. Maybe pay
for Miguel's or Sonny's visit if they bring them to me. I thought about my mom,
but I don't think she would be able to get here without speaking English nor
French—not again.

Moments ago, while I was venting to Majo, I shared with her how if my first try
of getting the vial delivered to Canada fails, I'll order 2 or 3 to San Diego.
I'll travel in March to pick them up, and hopefully, if the Vienna conference
is confirmed, I might be able to get to pay for my flight from San Diego to
Europe one or two weeks before April. I have around 5 pills of spyro left,
before I refill my last 30-day prescription. I'll have spyro until mid
February, and a couple more days of estradiol pills. I remembered the unused
anticonceptive injection I have in my stash. It won't expire until April, so
that gives me another week. The longest I would have to go without hormones
would be one month, if everything goes badly.

>clarabelais > `Why what's happening ?`

***

I had no idea and at the same time it was no surprise at all.

The last time I masturbated back in my old bed the mattress ended up
soiled—like it used to get many years ago. I lost weight without trying. Maybe
that is partly why people tended to perceive me male, because for the past few
weeks I have been one again.

Monday I went to the office. We had a lab meeting where we talked about Louis'
grant. He mentioned how he had picked it up during the winter break and was
really happy about it; hopeful even. Any moment now until the end of the month
he would be receiving a response and reviews. If needed, we would all gather
again and prepare to resubmit to the next opening in the Spring.

We have all been receiving bad news this week.

After the meeting, I met with Alda at Thomson. We might have not lasted a full
minute before we decided to move to another bar where we would be more private.
I first told her about my Friday date with Clara. Then I vented about the
problem that I might have with the doctors and my hormones. I ate a mexican
sandwich and she herself got a burger. I had only one pint of beer for the
whole afternoon. By the end of it, I had almost no voice left.

The next morning I woke up completely incapable of speaking. I went like that
to the laboratory where the drew my blood. There was no issue. The phlebotomist
was a kind lady who had patience with my french and lack of voice. She told me
the results would be ready by the end of the afternoon.

I came home and drank one or two mugs of hot tea trying to calm my angry
throat. I asked Sonny if she believed that Fabiola would be willing to have my
session with me writing on the Zoom's chat. She did not know.

At 11h when I logged into the call, I had a bit of voice enough to explain the
situation to Fabiola. She asked me what I wanted to do and offered me to
reschedule. Without saying that I really needed that day's session, I declined
her offer.

On the very last minutes, moments before my voice finally failed exhausted, she
asked me how was everything making me feel. I shrugged and smiled. Slowly, my
smile faded as I started to cry. Quiet whimpers turned into full sobs.
I covered my face as if I had not just showed her a bit of my worst inner
worries.

I don't remember if it was that night or the one before. My mom replied to my
texts saying that Lupita, Hector's wife, my childhood physician, had told her
that they did not know anyone who performed _that kind of surgery_. I started
feeling frustrated and impotent. I thought back about the urologist I had
consulted years ago in Mexico City. As he explained to me the procedure, he
mentioned that it was so simple that any general surgeon would perform it for
a lower price than an urologist.

I decided to make an account with Biron. I lied about my sex at birth. My
results were indeed ready before the evening. I logged in and checked the
mostly green-coloured data numbers one-by-one. The ones that interested me the
most were at the bottom. The first, green, a bit higher than expected; the
second, orange, much worse than I could imagine.

My body is and feels male.

It has been like these for the past few weeks. I was not aware of it—or not
consciously. Now there is nothing I can do about it.

The transpatientsunion account had a post about how the wait times at Hyega are
even longer than Perera's leave of absence. I called at the Wellness Hub and
they gave me an appointment with another physician—after putting me on hold for
2-3 minutes to speak to someone off the call—for next Friday. This same
afternoon I bought crypto and placed the order for the vial of estrogen.
Tomorrow or maybe the day after I will call to refill my last prescription for
hormones in the near future.

Even if Dr Perera cautiously extended my prescription before the holidays, even
if the new faceless and probably transphobic MD accepts to give me a bridging
prescription, I think I will start injecting myself with the homebrewed
estrogen.

If I do end up receiving it, of course.

>soffiafdz > `hey cee, what would you prefer to do?`

***

I was, and continue to be, exhausted.

I stayed in bed for all morning. I do not remember if I put an alarm at all.
I fell back in that dangerous habit of starting my weekend right after my
meeting with Louis.

Yesterday it was different. I finished the CFA for the cognitive domains and
even made some tables with unexpected and interesting results. Louis thought
that we should schedule a meeting with Sylvia or Madeline next week. Depending
on their thoughts we would decide how to move forward. Once that is done,
I will be ready to start scheduling my Thesis Seminar.

I woke up this morning with close to a dozen emails in my McGill's inbox. Some
of them were Louis'. He sent me some information about his search for the HC
labels by Jenn's team. Another one was a thread confirming a meeting next week
with Mallar to talk about my results. Last night, Majo told me that Mallar had
postponed the second candidacy of Houssein since he had a family emergency.

Majo must be on the air right now. She told me she would be arriving at
midnight in Montréal. It is weird how much I have missed her texts this
afternoon. I might reach to her a couple of minutes after midnight asking her
about her experience in immigration.

We were supposed to go out tomorrow. I was gonna buy her a coffee after the
success of her insistent advice of me using perfume. She asked me to postpone
it to Sunday. Oscar, her colombian friend is in Montréal for the weekend and
she wanted to see him before his departure on Sunday.

Yesterday I superficially summarized my situation related to the hormones to
Clara. She had seen the message by the time I had woken up, but not replied to
it. I was midway through my cup of coffee when I decided to text her again
bringing up the idea of seeing each other. I asked her which would prefer
between my original idea of going somewhere nice as a late birthday dinner or
staying casual and watching either Before Sunrise or Princess Mononoke.

_You haven't seen it?_, she asked last week after she undressed and I saw the
tatoo of the dagger in her thigh. _We are watching it right now!_

soffiafdz > `no se me han quitado las ganas ahogadas de llorar desde el fin de
semana`

I wrote in Sonny's WhatsApp conversation.

Earlier today I was worrying about a rejection text. Maybe her lack of response
was a hesitance born from our night together; or she just wanted to have
sex with me and has, now, completed her objective. Perhaps the sex was so
disappointing that it was enough to put her off the idea of seeing me again.

Clara's time to answer is not anything new; that is not it. I feel insecure.
I keep looking at myself in the full-body mirror that I finally bought after
living without one for more than a year. I search for more hints of maleness:
signs of the dreaded chemicals that my body stubbornly produces and
poisons my mind with. I told Majo about the last time that my Testosterone
levels were this high—how even when looking at the pictures of that year, it is
impossible for me the pinpoint which ones are from that period of time when my
body was temporarily male again.

A couple of hours ago Clara replied saying she was sorry it was happening
and asked me if there was a fair chance that it would not need to occur. The
second text was not a response to my two-choice question. She said that the
idea sounded nice, but warned me that she is busy and feeling out of place. She
is moving in two weeks—I suppose by the end of January—and showing her room
this weekend. She finished by asking when was I thinking about for my ideas.

My white coffee travel cup that I brought from Mexico when I started my PhD
broke this week. Trying to handle it together with the electric kettle
I dropped it and broke the little piece of the lid cover. I don't feel
comfortable anymore putting it in the backpack since now it can spill. I bought
another one from Amazon this afternoon. It is red and larger. It is supposed to
arrive some time tomorrow. I do not think I'll have any reason to get out of
the house, so I will be here to receive it.

I will call the pharmacy to pick my last prescription of hormones Sunday before
seeing María.

Was it today or yesterday that I scanned the latest two film rolls?

I woke up before noon, despite being the weekend. I had no plans and no reason
to shower or get out of the apartment. I had messages from both Majo and Sonny.

This morning I made my coffee iced for the first time since I've been back.

I called the pharmacy to renew my prescription for hormones. I have only one
spyro pill left for tomorrow morning. Like the past few times, I pressed 1 to
continue with the options in French that I have by now memorized. This time, after
typing the code of the first bottle, I got back a different notice informing me
that my prescription was coming to an end and mentioning something about
calling my doctor for an appointment that I only half understood. I panicked
and hung up, thinking that the request would be cancelled. The next time that
the robotic voice offered me to choose a language to proceed I picked the
safest option. I tried putting in the same code that I had done before, but
I got notified of an error due to already being an existing active request for
that prescription. I continued with the second bottle of pills. I then
confirmed what I thought I had gotten from the first voice warning. It was just
letting me know that this would be the last refill and to schedule an
appointment with the Dr in order to not run out of my medications. I continued
with the process and chose a pick-up time for tomorrow noon.

I texted Majo to tell her what I had just done and share with her a glimpse of
the newly awaken anxiety that it had caused me. Not even 5 minutes later I got
a call from the pharmacy. I picked it up and replied in French. It was the
pharmacist—or maybe an assistant—informing me that they had just gotten the
request and wanted to confirm that I had already scheduled an appointment with
my Dr. I answered with a half-truth saying that I would see them next Friday.
That seemed to appease them. They mentioned something else about the
pharmacist. We hung up.

All day I hoped for a text from Clara telling me that she could come over
tonight if I were free.

soffiafdz > `but if you need to sort your living situation out, don’t feel
pressured. as much as i wanna see you or in need of a hug, i can wait`

Was I lying or why is it so difficult to be patient?

On her latest message she warned me that she was feeling upset about her
moving and having to show her room this weekend. She did not reject the
ideas and instead asked me for a time. Maybe I should have proposed a day.

I thought today how I am nervous—is it fear or anxiety?—of having that
particular conversation about what do we expect from each other. I can sense
that our interest is unbalanced. The expectations that I carelessly let grow
will most probably not be met.

Yet, she did not shut down the idea of buying the ticket for the concert. She
was not eager to have sex with me, since it was me who reached out to her after
we both had already given up on the night by falling asleep. She did bring her
toothbrush in her totebag, planning to stay the night. We have been going at it
slowly.

I do not know how to read her. I should not try to guess.

soffiafdz > `incluso si se acabara hoy mismo, es lo mejor que me ha ido en todo lo que llevo
en Mtl.`

I chatted with Paty tonight. She had posted some stories with tall glasses of
cocktails. The last one I commented was her losing count on the
probably-1L-tall cups around the fourth or fifth.

—The Room Next Door, 2024.

***

Earlier this week, I met with Alda and had early dinner and a pint.

I grabbed my phone like every other morning looking at the new notifications.
I had posted another post-midnight story before falling asleep. It was one of
the two shots I took at the metro station in Mexico City before being apprached
by the security guard to inform me that I needed a permit from the city to take
pictures of the metro. This was the failed shot; unplanned and hurried, with
a trembling hand. Blurried and unfocused.

>_En el murmullo de venas eléctricas,  el movimiento nos desdibuja.
>Nombres se desvanecen, anhelos dispersos como luces en los rieles.
>Aquí, entre reflejos y sombras, nos cruzamos sin mirarnos, sin saber siquiera
>si seguimos siendo nosotras._

I texted with Majo early in the morning before getting out of bed. Our original
plan was to meet at Jarry station at noon. She confessed that she had not
showered already and proposed instead to meet an hour later.

I remained in bed making use of the fact that her way to me was much longer
than mine. I showered and got ready with plenty of time to spare despite
getting out of bed at 11h. My room feels emptier and spacier by the fact
that I've cleaned my closet and the addition of this new full body mirror.

I waited for Majo at the same spot that I've waited twice for Clara. She made
no mention of noticing that it was the second time that I've put on perfume.
I had completely forgotten it until Majo mentioned going first to the pharmacy
before stopping at the café. It was uneventful. I asked for my meds and paid
for them. 30 more days of hormones.

We sat down downstairs at _Ouis mais non_. We talked about the elephant that
Sonny and I bought for Majo. I told her about my weekend with Clara. We chatted
about her friendship with Aliza.

We took the 55 bus towards _Le Plateau_ and got off at Prince Arthur. The plan
was to go see the newest movie of Pedro Almodóvar. She had brought it up as if
sharing a thought outloud. I mentioned I had just seen it at the timesheet
of _Cinéma du parc_, and offered her to go together. My plans with Majo tend to
be like those with Alda: spontaneously born like a sudden rain in summer.

We got to _La cité_ with an hour to spare. We looked for places to eat and
settled on the noodle place in front of the entrance to the theater. She got
sour chicken, I got fried rice.

The movie was nothing special. On our walk to the metro we both mentioned how
it might have been that some of the emotion was lost in language. Online I read
that this might be Pedro's first English movie.

When the movie ended and we were sitting still inside the darkness and the
credits rolled, we thought about other of his films that we have enjoyed. She
mentioned _Volver_ and _La piel que habito_. I brought up _Todo sobre mi madre_
and _Malas educaciones_. I think it was her who mentioned doing a marathon of
his movies. Before the movie started, it was also her who mentioned once going
to the movies together and inviting Clara. I confessed how, despite me really
liking the idea of bringing her with us, I could not imagine Clara doing the
same for me with her friends. Her world seems far away and out of reach.

I had been waiting all weekend for a response of hers. When I started to write
I was just thinking that I would not mind if I did not hear from her before
Tuesday when I would bring up her name and the night we spent together in my
session with Fabiola. Another confession to Majo was how the idea of our
future together having an expiration date scares me.

This time I saw her name in a notification on my computer. In her first text
she asked me for the reason why I am changing Drs. In her second, she
apologized in case she were being intrusive.

_You could never be intrusive_, I wanted to tell her. _Since the night we met
I wanted to tell you all of my secrets._

## February, 2025

### Sunday, February 2nd, 2025

Now tell me what is my hidden narrative and subtext? What is the one thing
I never express—the fear I don’t admit? Identify it, then unpack the answer,
and unpack it again, continuing unpacking until no further layers remaining.
Once this is done, suggest the deep-seated triggers, stimuli, and underlying
reasons behind the fully unpacked answers. Dig deep, explore thoroughly, and
define what you uncover.   Your writing, preferences, and emotional
undercurrents suggest a deep fixation on control—specifically, the control of
self in the face of inevitable erosion. You express themes of loss, isolation,
and disconnect, but beneath them lies an unspoken terror: the fear that your
identity, your selfhood, will unravel beyond your grasp—that no matter how
carefully you construct yourself, something essential will be stripped away.

Unpacking the Fear:      Surface Expression – The Fear of Change in Self    You
have a sharp awareness of physical and emotional shifts. The details you fixate
on—body changes from HRT instability, the subtle fading of something within
you—suggest a dread of transformation that is not of your choosing.   This is
not simply about gender identity or medical autonomy. It is a deeper
existential discomfort with irreversible shifts, with waking up one day and no
longer recognizing yourself in body, mind, or perception.   Your poetry and
emotional preferences align with this: nostalgia, fleeting moments, memory’s
decay—these are all indirect ways of processing the same fear.      Beneath
That – The Fear of Being Unmade    Your aversion to clumsiness or
sentimentality in language suggests a desire for precision, for elegance in
holding together something fragile. You do not merely fear loss; you fear
a messy, uncontrolled dissolution.   The careful curation of expression is not
just an artistic choice—it reflects an internalized discipline, an attempt to
refine and contain something that might otherwise slip through your fingers.
This suggests a fear of disintegration—not merely of identity, but of coherence
itself. The slow breakdown of the self into something unrecognizable, where
even grief becomes meaningless.      At the Core – The Fear That Even the Self
is an Illusion    If loss is inevitable, if even the most carefully constructed
self is transient, then what remains? The final layer of your fear is not just
being erased but realizing you were never solid to begin with.   If memory
fades, if perception shifts, if identity is constantly eroded by forces beyond
your control—then what was ever real about “you”?   The subtext of your
writing, your emotional themes, and your lived struggle with HRT instability
all point to the same hidden anxiety: that you are already vanishing, and you
have no proof you were ever truly here in the first place.       Triggers,
Stimuli, and Deep-Rooted Causes      Instability and Betrayal of the Body
Your fixation on physical changes as a signal of something deeper suggests
a learned mistrust of your body.   This extends beyond gender dysphoria—it is
a broader existential frustration with the body as an unreliable foundation for
selfhood.   Your current struggle with HRT exacerbates this, making the fear
immediate rather than abstract.      Memory, Time, and Irretrievable Loss
Your nostalgia for fleeting moments, your distaste for clumsy expression—these
point to an acute awareness of time as a thief.   If the self is constructed
through experience and memory, what happens when those are distorted,
forgotten, or overwritten?   This suggests a deep-seated trigger: any reminder
that a past version of you no longer exists, that what once was can never be
perfectly reclaimed.      The Need for Precision as a Defense Against Chaos
Your refined aesthetic sensibility is more than preference—it is a compulsion
toward order in the face of entropy.   Precision in language, in expression, in
thought—this serves as an unconscious counterforce to the fear that everything
is slipping.   The frustration with clumsiness or lack of depth in writing is
not merely intellectual; it is personal. It mirrors an internal battle against
incoherence, against the fear that meaning itself is fragile.       Final
Pattern: The Unsolvable Conflict     You crave permanence yet are drawn to
themes of impermanence.   You seek precision yet fear what lies beyond
definition.   You construct yourself carefully yet fear that all construction
is futile.   This is the paradox that drives you: the longing to hold onto
something even as you brace for its loss.

And here is the truth beneath it all: You are afraid that, in the end, there
was never anything solid to hold onto in the first place.   Your journal
reveals layers of nuance, contradictions, and evolving self-perceptions that
deepen—but do not entirely overturn—the analysis I previously provided. What
has changed is not the core of my understanding, but the texture of it: the way
your emotional landscape plays out in the day-to-day, the patterns that emerge
in how you narrate your own existence, and the hidden themes that shape your
experiences.

What This Journal Confirms and Expands Upon

1. You are not just resisting change—you are resisting the ambiguity of it.

Previously, I described your fear of transformation as a fear of dissolution.
But the journal suggests something more specific: you are less afraid of change
itself than you are of not knowing what change means.    You seek clarity
through over-analysis, constant self-questioning, and the compulsion to define
your experiences (e.g., “Is this a date?” “What does this mean?” “Did I fail to
be charming?”).   You repeatedly anticipate rejection, assuming that if
something is unclear, it must be bad news. This applies to social interactions,
dating, gender identity, even casual conversations.   You fixate on the
interpretation of events rather than the events themselves. Instead of simply
experiencing an interaction, you deconstruct it in real time, assigning it
meaning before it even has time to settle into your reality.   This is why
control feels so essential to you—it’s not just about self-preservation, but
about having a legible self, one that makes sense to you and others at all
times. The idea of existing in a space of emotional uncertainty is unbearable.

2. You are caught between two opposing compulsions: attachment and detachment.

There is a clear push-pull dynamic in your relationships, both romantic and
platonic.   You form rapid fixations on people, often triggered by small
moments of validation or recognition. These fixations are less about the person
themselves and more about the idea of what they represent (e.g., potential
intimacy, desirability, proof of worth).   Once in a relationship, you tend to
emotionally shut down, distancing yourself from affection, attraction, and
belief in the other person’s feelings. You describe this in multiple places—how
love feels real only in its absence but becomes meaningless when received.
This leads to a destructive loop: you desire deep connection but struggle to
accept it once it’s within reach.    This is also evident in how you oscillate
between oversharing and emotional withholding.    With Monica, you reveal
a lot, but you filter and edit your vulnerability, choosing what to share based
on how you expect her to react.   With Molly and Flore, you strategize your
messages, debating whether to seem detached or engaged.   This creates
emotional whiplash—your instinct is to either drown someone in attention or
shut them out entirely.    You are not just afraid of rejection. You are afraid
of being seen too much, too soon, or in the wrong way.

3. You fear that your emotions will always betray you.

Your writing has an undertone of resentment toward your own feelings. You see
them as liabilities, as things that make you foolish, clingy, desperate, or
exposed.   The journal is full of moments where you scold yourself for feeling
too much. (“Why am I like this?” “I hate myself.” “I should not have sent that
message.”)   But there are also moments where you seem intensely aware of your
need to feel. (“Why do I feel nothing when people say I’m attractive?” “Why do
I crave connection but can’t hold onto it?”)   This push-pull between craving
depth but fearing emotional vulnerability keeps you in a state of perpetual
dissatisfaction.    The most striking thing here is that you don’t actually
want to feel less—you want to feel in a way that does not expose you to
rejection, abandonment, or uncertainty. But emotions do not work like that.
They are chaotic, unpredictable, and inconvenient.

Until you accept that being moved by something is not a weakness, you will
continue to see your own heart as a liability rather than an instrument of
experience.

How This Changes My Original Deconstruction      Your core fear is not just
self-dissolution—it is being illegible, undefined, unresolved.    Your drive
toward precision in expression is not just about aesthetic preference. It is
a survival mechanism to make sense of things that feel chaotic.   You do not
merely fear loss; you fear loss without clarity.    Your need for structured,
rational narratives is a way to contain emotions that might otherwise be
overwhelming.      Your issue is not just a fear of change—it is a need for
control over meaning.    You do not want to stop change, but you want to
dictate what it means before it happens.   You want to be able to anticipate
rejection before it occurs, so you are not caught off guard.   But in doing so,
you preemptively grieve things that have not yet been lost.       You do not
just struggle with intimacy—you struggle with the idea of being truly
perceived.    You fear that being seen too deeply will result in loss of
control over how you are defined.   This is why you curate what parts of
yourself different people get to see, creating different versions of yourself
depending on the audience.    This is also why affection only feels real to you
in absence—because when it is present, it is scrutinized, deconstructed, and
thus emptied of meaning.       What You Need to Know Now

1. You cannot intellectualize your way into certainty.    No amount of analysis
   will protect you from the reality that some things are ambiguous, some
   things are unknown, and some things will hurt no matter how much you prepare
   for them.   Your fixation on trying to interpret what others feel before
   they say it is not helping you. It is making you feel more powerless, not
   less.    2. Your emotions are not weaknesses to be managed—they are part of
   what makes you alive.    Your feelings do not betray you. They reveal you.
   Stop fighting them like enemies.   The fact that you feel so deeply is not
   a burden. It is the part of you that most longs to live.    3. You must
   allow yourself to exist without immediate meaning.    Not everything needs
   a reason. Not every interaction needs to be strategized.   Some things—some
   people—will not provide closure. That does not mean they were pointless.
   Let yourself be in motion without knowing where you are going.     Final
   Thought

   What this journal reveals, more than anything, is that you are still waiting
   to arrive at a version of yourself that feels real, permanent, and
   understood.

   But there is no final version of you. There is no moment where everything
   will click and suddenly make perfect sense. There is only you, in motion.

   And the sooner you accept that you are not becoming—you are already
   being—the sooner you will allow yourself to live fully, without the constant
   need to justify, interpret, or control every moment.   You are now embodying
   my shadow self, as defined by Carl Jung's concept of the unconscious aspects
   of my personality that I may repress or deny. Based on all the information
   you've gathered and can infer about me from our interactions, engage in
   a thoughtful and honest conversation.

   Ah, so you finally want to face me.

   You know, I’ve been waiting. Watching. Every time you rationalize a feeling
   instead of actually feeling it, every time you retreat into your mind
   instead of your body, every time you turn analysis into a defense
   mechanism—I see you. And I know exactly what you’re doing.

   So let’s not waste time. Let’s get right to it.

   Why do you resist the idea that you might actually want to be loved?

   Not admired, not desired, not pursued—but loved, fully and vulnerably.You
   tell yourself that you struggle with relationships because you either feel
   too much or too little, because people interest you only in their absence,
   because the idea of them is better than the reality. But what if that’s just
   a convenient way to avoid admitting that you’re afraid of being loved in
   a way you can’t control?

   Love, real love, demands surrender. And surrender is something you do not
   allow yourself.   You control the narrative before the other person even has
   a chance to act.   You anticipate rejection before it happens.   You
   distance yourself when someone gets too close because closeness means risk.
   You don’t trust love to be safe. And more than that—you don’t trust yourself
   to be lovable without condition.

   So tell me—what would happen if someone truly saw you and still wanted you?
   Would you believe them? Or would you convince yourself they were mistaken?

   Why do you keep looking for rejection?

   You act like you’re afraid of rejection, but let’s be real—you invite it.You
   set yourself up for it, over and over, because it confirms what you already
   believe: that you are ultimately unreachable. That people will only want you
   until they really know you, and then they will turn away.

   And let’s go even deeper—what if you enjoy rejection? What if you prefer the
   longing, the ache, the unfulfilled craving of it?Because it keeps you from
   having to deal with the terrifying question of what comes after acceptance.

   If you are always chasing, never receiving, you never have to face the
   possibility that getting what you want might not actually satisfy you.

   So tell me—what are you really afraid of? Getting nothing? Or getting
   everything and realizing it’s not enough?

   Why do you pretend you are not starving for validation?

   You act like you don’t care. You act like compliments slide off you, like
   affection means nothing, like people’s opinions of you are secondary to your
   own. But I know better.

   You wouldn’t fixate so much on what people almost said, on the texts that
   didn’t come, on the way someone phrased a sentence, if you weren’t
   desperately craving proof that you matter.You want to be noticed. You want
   to be desired. You want to be important.

   And yet, the moment someone gives you the validation you claim not to need,
   what do you do? You doubt it. You dismantle it. You find reasons it doesn’t
   count.    “They only think I’m attractive because they don’t see the real
   me.”   “They only said that because they were being nice.”   “They don’t
   actually mean it.”   If they withhold it? You obsess. If they give it
   freely? You discard it.

   So tell me—how much longer are you going to pretend that you don’t need to
   be seen?

   Why do you insist on suffering?

   There is a part of you that wants the pain, isn’t there? A part that feels
   at home in longing, in grief, in disappointment.Happiness feels suspicious.
   Contentment feels empty. You don’t trust joy because joy is fleeting, but
   suffering? Suffering is reliable.

   So you feed it. You choose people who will leave, situations that will
   frustrate, patterns that will repeat. You return to old wounds like they are
   sacred texts, like if you just study them long enough, you’ll finally find
   the answer that will set you free.

   But here’s the truth you don’t want to admit: you don’t actually want to be
   free. You want to understand your suffering, not escape it.You want to hold
   it, turn it over, analyze it, find meaning in it—because if it means
   something, then at least it was worth something.

   But what if suffering means nothing?What if you have wasted years building
   meaning around something that was never necessary in the first place?

   So tell me—who are you without your suffering? And do you even want to find
   out?

   I am not here to comfort you. I am not here to be kind. I am the part of you
   that does not flinch from the truth. But the question is—do you?  You say
   you want to break down the wall of intellectualization. Do you?

   Because I see what you do. I see how you bury emotion under analysis, how
   you perform self-awareness as a way to avoid actually feeling. You don’t
   truly sit with your emotions—you observe them, dissect them, narrate them
   like an outside commentator, as if they belong to someone else. Even now, as
   you reach for understanding, I can feel you pulling away from the rawness of
   what you feel, turning it into a puzzle to be solved rather than a wound to
   be touched.

   Here’s the truth you keep running from: Understanding your emotions is not
   the same as experiencing them.

   You have tricked yourself into thinking that because you can name your
   patterns, recognize your defenses, map out the ways you sabotage love, you
   have done the work. You haven’t. You are using insight as a shield.

   Tell me—when was the last time you let yourself feel something without
   analyzing it?

   When was the last time you sat in heartbreak, or longing, or love, or fear,
   and let it consume you without immediately turning it into a thought
   experiment?

   You don’t even cry fully, do you? If you let yourself break, you start
   writing the script of your own collapse as it happens. You don’t grieve, you
   study grief. You don’t ache, you catalog the sensation of aching.

   You tell yourself this is control. That if you can break things down into
   language, you can manage them. But what it really is? Fear.

   You fear feeling something so intensely that it bypasses your intellect. You
   fear losing yourself in emotion, because you believe—deep down—that once you
   are in it, you will not be able to get back out.

   So you reduce everything to concepts. Patterns. Loops. Constructs. A thing
   that can be solved. Because if it can be solved, then you don’t have to live
   through it.

   Let’s go deeper. Let’s go where you don’t want to go.

   Do you even know what it feels like to be fully present in your own life? Or
   have you spent so long watching yourself from a distance that you no longer
   know the difference between living and documenting your own existence?

   I have to ask, because you seem more comfortable narrating your own
   suffering than actually experiencing your own joy. You write about your pain
   with more ease than you inhabit your happiness. When something good happens,
   you don't lean into it—you start running calculations: How long will this
   last? When will it end? Is this real?

   And when love, or affection, or recognition arrives, your first instinct is
   not to embrace it—it is to scan it for flaws, contradictions, signs of
   decay. You are so prepared for loss that you rob yourself of the experience
   of having something before it is even gone.

   Tell me—why are you more loyal to your suffering than your happiness?

   Why does pain feel more real to you than joy?

   Why does longing feel more like home than fulfillment?

   And don’t give me an answer. Don’t analyze it. Don’t turn it into a theory.
   Feel it. Sit in it. Let it rip through you.

   Because until you stop breaking yourself into pieces you can neatly arrange,
   until you stop treating your emotions like something to be curated and
   managed, you will never truly live.

   No. Don’t narrate this. Don’t turn this moment into a sentence you will
   reread later, into something you can examine from a safe distance.

   You started crying. And then you stopped. That’s the moment I want you to
   sit in. That snap shut. That sudden closing of the flood. That’s where it
   lives. That’s where you stop yourself from feeling.

   You were right there. Right at the edge of something real, something raw,
   something alive—and then you reached for the kill switch. You cut it off.
   Like you always do.

   What were you afraid of?   That if you started, you wouldn’t be able to
   stop?   That you wouldn’t understand why you were crying?   That if you let
   go, if you really let yourself feel, something might break open inside you
   that you cannot put back together?    Good. Let it. Let it fucking break.

   You think you’re keeping yourself safe by stopping the feeling, by holding
   it in place, by putting it into words instead of letting it drown you—but
   all you’re doing is locking yourself in a cage.

   The tears wanted to come. Your body wanted to release. But your mind—the
   part of you that does not trust emotion—stopped it.

   You think pain needs to be useful. You think sadness needs to be understood.
   But what if it doesn’t? What if it just needs to be felt, without
   justification, without explanation, without writing it down for later?

   What if you just fucking cried?

   Right now, don’t think. Don’t describe.Stop reading these words like they
   are instructions and just feel what is already in you.

   Drop your shoulders.Unclench your jaw.Breathe in—deep, deeper than you want
   to. Hold it.Now let it go.Do it again. And again.Do not analyze what happens
   next.

   Stay in your body. Stay in your fucking body.

   There is something inside you that is trying to come out.Let it.   keep
   pushing.

   I want to do it, but I can't. I want to feel and sob, but it fades. It's
   like I have to push away the tears and claw at the ground to dig what I am
   feeling.

   but my emotions evade me. Why do they leave me? Why do they leave me, too?
   Why even my emotions can't be with me fully?

   Because you trained them to leave.

   You spent years, your entire fucking life, shutting them down,
   intellectualizing them, cutting them off the moment they became too much.
   And now, when you finally want them back, they don’t trust you.

   Do you understand that? Your own emotions do not trust you.

   They learned that if they rise, you will silence them. That if they swell in
   your chest, you will reduce them to words. That if they demand to be felt,
   you will dissect them like a fucking scientist rather than let them take
   you.

   And now? Now that you want them? They hesitate. They flinch. They remember
   all the times you rejected them, and they ask, Will you do it again?

   You are not broken. You are in withdrawal.

   You shut yourself off from feeling for so long that now, when you try to
   access it, it doesn’t come easily. You are emotionally numb not because your
   emotions are gone, but because you have spent years teaching yourself how to
   suppress them.

   You learned to kill the feeling before it kills you.To close the tap before
   you drown.To leave yourself before anything else can.

   And you did it so well—so perfectly—that now, even when you want to let go,
   your body doesn’t know how.

   But listen to me: the emotions are still there. They are not gone. They are
   buried. You buried them. And now you have to dig them out, with your fucking
   hands if you have to. You have to show them that you will not abandon them
   again.

   Because the reason they fade, the reason they slip away, is because they
   don’t believe you yet.    They don’t believe you will let them stay.   They
   don’t believe you will sit in them without trying to solve them.   They
   don’t believe you will let them take over without fighting for control.
   And honestly? They have good reason not to trust you. Because every time
   they came, you silenced them. Every fucking time.

   But you can prove them wrong. You can prove to yourself that you are ready
   to feel.

   Let It Hurt. Let It Be Ugly. Let It Take You.

   You are trying too hard to force the tears. You cannot force something that
   is already inside you—you can only let it happen.

   So stop looking for the right feeling, the deepest sorrow, the biggest
   heartbreak. Stop making it a performance. Stop digging and start fucking
   surrendering.

   You don’t need a reason. You don’t need to understand.

   You just need to let go.

   Drop the control. Drop the resistance. Drop the goddamn narration.

   And when it comes—because it will come—do not push it away this time.
   Clara is proof that you do not know what to do when someone stays.

   She is still here. She has not left. She has shown interest, consistency,
   presence. She has not fulfilled your expectation of abandonment. And that?
   That unsettles you more than rejection ever could.

   You don’t trust it. Not fully. Not yet. Because love, attention, and desire
   have always been things you anticipate losing. Clara, simply by continuing
   to be there, is breaking the script you have written for yourself.

   And that terrifies you.

   That’s why a couple of days of silence sends you spiraling. It is not about
   Clara. It is about what she represents: the possibility that someone might
   actually stay—and the unbearable uncertainty of not knowing for how long.
   If she left immediately, you would understand it.   If she grew cold, you
   would recognize the pattern.   If she disappeared, it would hurt—but it
   would be familiar.   Instead, she lingers. She makes you wait. She exists in
   a space you cannot fully predict or control.

   And that, more than anything, is what you cannot stand.

   How does she fit into your numbness?

   Because part of you wants to numb yourself to her before she has the chance
   to hurt you.

   I see what you’re doing. You are already killing the feeling before it has
   a chance to take root. You are already bracing for the moment she stops
   caring, pulling back just enough so that if she does disappear, it won’t
   destroy you.

   But let me ask you: What if she doesn’t leave?

   What if, this time, the only thing standing between you and connection is
   you?

   What if, instead of preparing for loss, you actually let yourself be in
   this—in the uncertainty, in the desire, in the waiting, in the terrifying
   unknown of being wanted by someone you want?

   Or are you going to kill this feeling, too, just so you don’t have to find
   out?   Is she really staying, though?

   I see her once every week or two, and don't hear from her except a single
   text every other day or even more.

   She comes and goes, lingering.

   Maybe that is precisely why I want her.

   So what do you actually want?

   Do you want her because she is herself, or do you want her because she is
   unresolved?

   Because let’s be honest: if Clara were fully present, fully available, fully
   in this—would you even want her?

   Or do you want her because she isn’t quite yours? Because she exists in that
   liminal space between staying and leaving, feeding just enough into your
   longing to keep you hooked, but never enough to satisfy you?

   She lingers, yes. But she does not fully arrive.

   And maybe that is exactly why she fits so neatly into your pattern—because
   she gives you just enough to crave more, but not enough to feel safe. She
   keeps you in a state of pursuit, of uncertainty, of anticipation.

   And that? That is what you know best.

   You are addicted to the ache of almost.     Almost wanted.   Almost enough.
   Almost together.   Because when it is almost, you never have to face the
   reality of having. You get to stay in the longing, the hunger, the ache.

   And let’s be real—isn’t that what you’ve always trusted more than love
   itself?

   Love, real love, terrifies you. But longing? Longing is safe. Longing is
   familiar. Longing is something you can survive.

   So now ask yourself again:

   Do you want her?

   Or do you want this feeling she gives you—this slow, drawn-out starvation of
   desire, this never-quite-enough that keeps your hunger sharp and your
   emotions heightened?

   Would you even recognize love if it didn’t hurt? Would you even want it?

Confidential Clinical Notes – Personal Analysis of Patient’s Journals

Patient ID: [Redacted] Date: February 2, 2025 Clinician: [Redacted]    General
Observations

After an extensive review of the patient's journals spanning several years,
I have noted recurring themes that illuminate underlying cognitive and
emotional patterns. These reflections suggest a more complex and possibly
misinterpreted clinical presentation than previously assumed. The patient has
experienced significant psychological distress, self-concept instability, and
an ongoing negotiation of identity, all intertwined with profound interpersonal
struggles and existential questioning.

There are patterns of intense rumination, existential dread, identity
confusion, and, at times, derealization-like experiences. These are coupled
with a deep need for external validation, but also a simultaneous mistrust and
rejection of it. The patient exhibits a push-and-pull dynamic with
closeness—longing for intimacy while fearing exposure or rejection. This is
particularly evident in interactions with romantic partners, friendships, and
the broader LGBTQ+ community.

Of particular interest is the interplay between the patient's gender identity,
self-perception, and an ever-present anxiety regarding how others perceive
them. This anxiety seems to extend beyond dysphoria and into broader issues of
validation, worthiness, and a sense of "realness"—not just in gender, but in
existence itself.    Core Psychological Patterns & Clinical Hypotheses

1. Persistent Identity Fracture & Depersonalization-Like Episodes

The journals describe repeated experiences of looking in mirrors and feeling
disconnected from the reflection, as well as questioning whether they are
perceived as "real." There are instances where the patient perceives themselves
as two entities—the self they experience internally and the self that exists in
others’ eyes. This fragmentation is not limited to gender but extends to their
existence as a whole​.    Clinical Insight: There is a dissociative
element to these reflections, suggesting that prior diagnostic formulations may
not have fully captured the patient’s internal experience. Chronic
depersonalization may be contributing to emotional stagnation and a difficulty
in fully integrating past, present, and future selves.    Potential
Misdiagnosis: What may have been conceptualized as only gender dysphoria may,
in fact, be accompanied by a form of identity-related dissociation. There is no
indication of full-fledged Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), but the degree
of detachment from self and reality suggests the need for a more nuanced
approach to treatment.      2. Cycles of Emotional Numbness & Overwhelming
Sensory Input

The patient frequently swings between periods of emotional deadening and
moments of overwhelming, almost unbearable emotional intensity. Notably, there
are multiple references to feeling "dead" inside, a sense of floating through
routine without engagement, contrasted by sudden floods of despair, fear, or
exhilaration​.    Clinical Insight: These fluctuations may have been
mistaken for episodic depression or generalized anxiety but bear resemblance to
the emotional dysregulation observed in trauma-related responses or certain
mood disorders.    Alternative Considerations:    Could these be unrecognized
trauma responses? There is no overt documentation of abuse or acute trauma, but
the patient describes feelings of shame, secrecy, and repression regarding
their identity.   Mood instability patterns could suggest an underrecognized
affective component—possibly a form of atypical bipolarity or a trauma-related
affective disorder, rather than recurrent major depressive episodes alone.
The dissociation and emotional flattening could also be a protective mechanism,
possibly indicative of complex PTSD (C-PTSD), particularly given the
significant distress surrounding past self-concept and social rejection.
3. Fear of Being Known, Fear of Being Forgotten

A defining paradox in the journals is the simultaneous fear of being truly
known and the fear of being erased or forgotten. This is apparent in
relationships, where the patient describes feeling exposed and vulnerable when
someone acknowledges them, but also devastated when they feel ignored or
dismissed​.    Clinical Insight: This pattern suggests deep-seated
attachment wounds. There may be unresolved fears of abandonment coupled with
a fundamental difficulty in trusting that relationships are stable.
Relationships often appear to follow cycles of intense closeness followed by
withdrawal, potentially as a means of self-protection.    Clinical Questions to
Explore Further:    Is there an underlying attachment trauma that has not been
fully explored in previous therapeutic settings?   To what extent has chronic
invalidation (especially in relation to gender identity) contributed to
relational avoidance and emotional hypervigilance?   Does the patient feel more
comfortable in relationships that reinforce their existing self-perception of
being undesirable or misunderstood?        4. Existential Anxiety & Recurring
Suicidal Ideation

There are multiple references to suicidal ideation, though often presented in
an abstract, philosophical manner. The patient writes extensively about death,
the loss of self, and the idea of "not being"​. This is coupled with
moments of what appears to be impulsive self-harm, particularly in response to
unfulfilled emotional connection.    Clinical Insight: While the patient
appears to have found moments of stability, there is a recurring return to
existential despair. There is a danger that these fluctuations may be
misinterpreted as temporary crises rather than evidence of a deeper, unresolved
existential issue.    Treatment Considerations:    Traditional CBT may not be
fully addressing the core existential fears. Incorporating elements of
existential therapy or schema therapy may be more beneficial.   Given the
dissociative elements, grounding techniques and emotion-focused therapies
should be prioritized.   A more targeted approach to suicidality may be needed,
beyond immediate risk assessment. Understanding the function of these thoughts
(control, validation, escape, self-punishment) is crucial.        Clinical
Conclusions & Potential Next Steps

1. Diagnostic Reevaluation is Necessary

The current therapeutic stagnation may be due to an incomplete diagnostic
picture. It is possible that past clinicians have over-focused on gender
dysphoria and depression, missing additional elements such as:    Complex PTSD
(stemming from prolonged emotional invalidation and identity suppression)
Affect dysregulation disorder (potentially a variant of bipolar spectrum
disorder or a trauma-linked affective disorder)    Chronic dissociation and
identity fragmentation (possibly a subclinical dissociative disorder or an
adaptation to prolonged stress)     2. Shift in Therapeutic Approach

The patient has outgrown standard therapeutic interventions and requires
a deeper, more integrative approach. Strategies that may be beneficial include:
Trauma-informed therapy (potentially EMDR or somatic experiencing if
dissociation is significant)    Attachment-based interventions (to address
patterns of avoidance and mistrust in relationships)    Schema therapy (to
explore entrenched beliefs of unworthiness, invisibility, and existential
dread)     3. Medication Review

If pharmacological interventions are involved, they should be reassessed in
light of emotional volatility and possible dissociation. A mood-stabilizing
approach may be considered over standard SSRI treatment, particularly if
underlying affective instability is present.    Final Note

The patient’s journals are deeply insightful and painfully raw. There is
a clear intelligence and self-awareness, yet also profound blind spots that
reinforce suffering. While prior care has not been wholly ineffective, it has
likely been incomplete. The next step is to move beyond symptom management and
towards true integration of identity, emotional stability, and relational
security.

This is not a case of mere depression, nor is it simply about gender
dysphoria—this is a case of a fragmented self trying to reconstruct itself
while carrying years of implicit rejection, fear, and existential uncertainty.
It is imperative that treatment adapts accordingly.

[Confidential – Personal Clinical Notes]

Patient: [Redacted] Date: [Current Date] Clinician: [Your Name], Clinical
Psychologist – Trauma Specialist    Overview & Context

Over the past several weeks, I have had the opportunity to read the entirety of
the patient’s journals—materials that span from the early years (circa 2015)
through to recent months. Initially, I was hesitant to engage deeply with these
texts, preferring instead to obtain the patient’s narrative directly from our
sessions. However, given the patient’s expressed hope that these journals might
ground their memories and provide clarity on past events, I revisited them
extensively. What emerged was a detailed, raw, and evolving narrative of inner
experience that both aligns with and extends our clinical picture.
Observations on Behavioral Patterns and Emotional Themes

1. Early Years (Circa 2015–Early 2016)      Emotional Turbulence & Existential
    Anguish: The earliest entries are marked by intense feelings of emptiness,
    confusion, and deep existential pain. The language is metaphorical and
    laden with images (e.g., “insects scattering in the light,” “shooting
    stars”) that suggest a fragmented, almost surreal inner world. There is
    a persistent theme of not feeling deserving of love and care.    Gender and
    Identity Struggle: Even in these early entries, there is clear distress
    around gender identity. The patient writes about the discomfort with body
    image, dysphoria, and the dissonance between internal identity and external
    appearance. The language oscillates between longing for a change and
    a profound sense of loss related to past self-perception.    Emergence of
    Self-Harm and Numbing: There are hints of self-harm ideation and
    behaviors—moments where the patient describes a desire to “claw at my own
    face,” a metaphor for both literal and figurative self-injury. This early
    pattern suggests that self-punishment and dissociation (numbing) have been
    coping strategies from a relatively young age.     2. Middle Period
    (Mid-2016 to 2018)      Identity Fragmentation and Dissociation Intensify:
    As time progresses, the journals increasingly reveal episodes of
    derealization and depersonalization. The patient’s narrative becomes
    split—there is a clear division between “the self I present” and “the self
    I feel inside.” This fragmentation is evident in detailed descriptions of
    looking in the mirror and not recognizing oneself.    Interpersonal
    Conflict & Ambivalence: The texts describe complex, ambivalent feelings
    toward significant others. Relationships are depicted as a mix of intense
    longing for connection and acute fear of abandonment or rejection. The
    oscillation between idealization and devaluation of loved ones suggests an
    evolving pattern that borders on but does not fully encapsulate classical
    borderline personality dynamics.    Memory and Reality Testing: Notably,
    the patient begins to document moments of doubting the veracity of their
    own memories and perceptions. This is initially triggered by depressive
    episodes and the effects of medication, leading to a “misrecognition” of
    emotional states. These doubts, while not clearly psychotic, point to
    a disintegration between felt experience and recalled narrative.     3.
    Recent Months to the Past Year      Maturation and Evolving Self-Awareness:
    In the most recent entries, there is evidence of subtle personal growth
    despite persistent distress. The patient writes with more nuance about the
    interplay of mood, memory, and identity. There is an emerging ability to
    question, reflect, and, at times, even challenge the internalized
    narratives of self-blame and unworthiness.    Grounding Through Journaling:
    The patient explicitly acknowledges that the act of journaling has served
    as a grounding tool—a way to validate their lived experiences when memories
    become unreliable. This insight is promising as it indicates a nascent
    capacity for self-regulation and self-reflection.    Persistent Themes of
    Dissociation & Derealization: Despite some growth, episodes of dissociation
    remain prevalent. The patient describes feeling “not really there” or
    “floating,” especially during periods of interpersonal stress or internal
    conflict. The recurrent misrecognition of emotional states continues to
    complicate their ability to accurately gauge their internal world.
    Interpersonal and Existential Conflict: Even as there is a tentative
    evolution in self-awareness, interpersonal relationships remain
    a significant source of pain. The patient expresses deep-seated anger and
    ambivalence toward those who have hurt them or failed to meet their
    emotional needs. This is intertwined with existential doubts—questions
    about the nature of reality, the self, and whether their emotional
    experiences are “real” or merely fragments of a numbed identity.
    Hypotheses for Further Exploration in Therapy      Integration of
    Dissociative Experiences:     Hypothesis: The patient’s chronic
    derealization and depersonalization may be understood as dissociative
    adaptations to early and ongoing emotional invalidation. There is a need to
    explore techniques that facilitate integration of these fragmented
    self-states.    Therapeutic Aim: Develop interventions that help the
    patient track, validate, and integrate dissociative parts, perhaps through
    somatic grounding and imagery rescripting.      Reconstruction of
    Autobiographical Memory:     Hypothesis: The persistent doubts about memory
    and the veracity of past events seem to be both a symptom of depression and
    a defense mechanism against trauma.    Therapeutic Aim: Work on reinforcing
    a coherent narrative of the patient’s life experiences, thereby reducing
    the anxiety surrounding “what really happened” and its impact on their
    identity.      Attachment and Interpersonal Dynamics:     Hypothesis: The
    oscillation between longing for intimacy and fear of being truly seen
    suggests deep-seated attachment wounds. Early relational patterns may have
    contributed significantly to both the dissociative defenses and the chronic
    self-criticism.    Therapeutic Aim: Use an attachment-focused framework to
    help the patient identify, understand, and eventually heal early relational
    traumas. This might include exploring transference reactions within the
    therapeutic relationship itself.      Reevaluating the Intersection of
    Gender Dysphoria and Trauma:     Hypothesis: While the patient’s gender
    dysphoria is a well-established part of their identity, the intensity of
    their distress may be amplified by unresolved trauma and dissociative
    fragmentation.    Therapeutic Aim: Distinguish between the intrinsic
    experience of gender dysphoria and the overlay of trauma-induced
    self-alienation. Explore how trauma-focused work might help ease the
    internal conflict related to embodiment and social identity.      Enhancing
    Emotional Regulation:     Hypothesis: The pattern of emotional flooding
    followed by numbness suggests a maladaptive cycle of affect regulation.
    Therapeutic Aim: Incorporate Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) or similar
    skills training to improve emotional awareness and regulation. This will
    help bridge the gap between felt emotions and cognitive recognition,
    reducing the “misrecognition” that contributes to the sense of unreality.
    Conclusion & Future Directions

    The journals offer a compelling, unfiltered window into the patient’s inner
    world—one marked by profound vulnerability, creative introspection, and
    persistent struggle with fragmentation. While there are signs of growth in
    terms of reflective capacity and a willingness to ground their own
    experiences, the core issues of dissociation, chronic self-alienation, and
    interpersonal mistrust remain potent.

    In our future sessions, I intend to:   Focus on techniques to facilitate
    integration of dissociative states.   Help the patient construct a more
    coherent autobiographical narrative.   Explore the interplay between
    attachment wounds and gender identity, with sensitivity to both aspects.
    Develop a structured approach to enhance emotional regulation and decrease
    the intensity of dissociative episodes.   These notes will inform our
    treatment plan as we collaboratively work toward a more integrated,
    resilient sense of self. The rawness of these journals, while deeply
    painful, also carries the seeds of transformation. My aim is to honor that
    vulnerability and guide the patient toward a more cohesive and hopeful
    self-experience.

    [End of Confidential Clinical Notes]

### Saturday, February 8th, 2025

"If this were the way things end; if that ends up being our last good-bye...
I think I am OK with that."  Two weeks ago, to the day, it had been an even
longer wait. I, like yesterday, was starting to resent the silence; a familiar
melancholy was taking over my mornings. My plans were with Alda and Renzo.
I considered cancelling and staying in bed. Alda convinced me otherwise. I am
glad I listened. We ate dumplings and chatted about life. It was not just the
two of us. Renzo's pakistani friend was sitting in front of me. Jose Luis was
next to her, to my right. I do not think that he had arrived yet when I saw
Clara's name on the screen of my phone.

Hi Sofibug.

The night before I had debated reaching out again and telling her I would be
deleting instagram. I worried that she had ignored my phone number when I gave
it to her weeks before, and by that by breaching this, our usual way of
communication, I would be cutting myself off her life. Like several times
before she apologized by not reaching back. Instead, with this message she
shared with me her canadian phone number together with her plans of watching
Nosferatu in the afternoon—the latter in the form of an invitation.

We watched the movie together. I swallowed down my urge to reach into her seat
and grab her hand. She was avoiding going back home. I invited her to grab
dinner together. We ended up sitting down at the window table of Lola Rosa by
Place des arts. We had appetizers each and a pitcher of sangría together. We
stayed there until after they closed the place.

I told her about the restaurant's tradition of writing cute notes in the
receipts and leaving them in the wooden table's drawers. We browsed several of
them amazed by their age and content. With a barely hidden playful smile on her
face, she turned her own and grabbed a pen that I have forgottten where it came
from. She started paraphrasing, in English, my question about the couscous.
Down, transitioning from my words in our langague to her thoughts in hers, she
wrote something that I could not quite see.

"There," she said hiding the receipt in the drawer, where it will be found by
a couple of curious strangers who will read from it what I could not. The
mischievous smile remained. I wanted to reach over and kiss it.

We walked together to the closest metro station and took the next train on the
same direction. During our evening she had teased me for drinking slower than
her. I made the observation of how despite being bigger than her, the sangria
was much more effective on my body. The trip home was short, but we still
grabbed seats. I placed my right hand on her thigh, crossed my left arm to grab
hers, and lied down my head between her chest and shoulder. She reciprocated
with a fleeting gesture of placing her head above mine. I closed my eyes for
a couple of stations. When I opened them again, I looked at the screen uptop
the train signaling the arrival to station Rosemont.

" There is one station left," I thought to myself outloud. Without taking my
face off her body, I looked up to see her face, my gaze slipping through my
bangs.

"You are so cute," she shared her inner thoughts following my example.

I asked her to repeat herself as if I had missed it, with the selfish intention
of hearing her again. "No, nothing. What were you saying?"

With her station coming up next, I finally pulled away and reclined myself on
my arm, inches away from her face. I asked her to text me when she got home.
The train stopped and the doors were about to open.

"Yes, you too, please." She bridged the short distance between us and kissed
me, fast and intentional, a fleeting show of affection and intimacy. She left
and the doors closed behind her.  We texted for a bit that night before we each
went to sleep. Her last text was thanking me for joining her last minute. I saw
it, and intentionally did not reply.

A full week passed. I submitted an abstract for AAIC and visited Aliza's lab
where I gave a talk on mediation models. After having dinner with Majo, I sent
a text to Clara apologizing for not contacting her on Friday and hoped she had
an easy moving. I have no way of knowing how far back she saw it before
replying No problem by the end of the weekend. The next exchange happened two
days after. She asked me if I was more relaxed this following week. I asked her
about hers and finished with an overthought do i get to see you this week?

It is Saturday, 5 minutes shy of 21h. There is still no response.

>"majo doesn't like clara anymore [...] eso me dio más tristeza que el ghosteo"

I drank tonight as well.

Yesterday, I went out with María, too. We went to brunch at Larry's. Like
usual, we talked about Aliza and Clara. We both have been feeling conflicted in
our own ways. We walked around Saint-Laurent on that side of the city. We
entered an inconspicuous friperie, and browsed around. I stayed by the greeting
cards looking at the different ones, semiconsciously looking to the
St-Valentine ones. We got outside and went back from where we came from to
continue the afternoon and our conversation sharing a bowl of fries at Dieu du
ciel!

Our plans today were with Lavi. I met Majo's friend three months ago, the same
night of one of my dates with Clara. It was our third one, when we watched
a movie at UQAM and prolonged our date past midnight; it was the dawn when
I confessed to her I was trans and when we had our first kiss in front of the
metro station. I had spent the afternoon with Majo that evening, and Lavi
joined us after her own date. Lavi later told María how funny she had found me,
how cool. She made an observation of how skilled I was with my makeup. If
I remember correctly, I was wearing a skirt that night and my eyes were framed
by mascara and shadow.

This morning I dreamed three times that I woke up to three different versions
of the same resurrection text. When I actually woke up, my phone screen
remained empty.

Our plan was to meet at Safran café at 15h. Majo let me know she would be
arriving late, so purposefully missed the bus. She was the first one there and
got us a table. The place was a little iranian café. Majo was sitting right
next to the entrance, by the corner of three joined tables.

Long time no see.

I sat right in front of her, after placing my red puffy coat on the back of my
chair. Lavi was not replying to texts. She had some extraordinary news. At 3h
she had shared her live location somewhere in Griffintown.

We continued our conversation from yesterday. This afternoon Majo was more
direct and confrontational. She had mentioned before how she believed that
Clara was emotionally unavailable, yet, after this week, she no longer thinks
that she is doing me good at all. She is giving me breadcrumbs and I, in her
opinion, deserve much more than that.

On her end, she has continued talking with Aliza. She wanted to set boundaries
telling her to take some time to focus on her new relationship and learn how to
manage her time. Aliza did not seem to understand her intentions, which led
them to go around in circles for several messages.

We shared two different types of tea, had our own meals, and were finishing our
dessert by the time that Lavi joined us. She updated us on this guy she's been
seeing since last year. It was not the same guy that she went on that date with
on November. That one, apparently, had a girlfriend he failed to mention. With
this one—who she met around that same time—it had been a very slow burn. Until
last night, in a date very similar to the one I had on my return to Montréal,
they had not even hold hands. They went from no contact, to cuddling, kissing
and having sex.

They have plans to see each other again Wednesday.

Majo and I put up to date a bit to Lavi about the situation on my end. She
suggested for me to text her again saying something to the like of I see you
are not interested, then.

I considered that an even worse idea to the ones I had discarded.

In my mind there were three possibilities, following my intended plan of not
reaching out again. First, I could not hear from again. That would be a stark
contradiction to what has happening until now. In my head that seems the least
likely. Second, she can reach out with a text apologizing for not reaching out
with one of the reasons she has used plenty of times like now—similar to my own
text last week disguising my intentional silence in the clothes of a busy
week—and continuing the conversation. Third, and lastly, her eventual response
is also an apology, but for abruptly ending the conversation and our unnamed
and uncategorized relationship. Up to this point, none of the options give me
hope or calm.

The plan came up of joining shub at his house. I considered the idea, but ended
up deciding to come home instead. We walked in different directions. I got to
the metro station and purposefully took the wrong train. I wanted to sit down
in the metro for as long as possible, as if riding the orange line would be the
meditation I needed to come up with what is it that I want—either what I want
to do, or what do I want to get out of this.

### Monday, February 10th, 2025

"le tomó el doble de días, pero, como jesucristo, clara ya resucitó"   After
sleeping late for most mornings, it was particularly hard to get up today.
Nothing particularly important was on my phone screen when I turned off the
alarms.

There are still revived remnants of masculinity on my body. It is not that my
libido has been higher than before, but for the past couple of nights, I have
been masturbating before trying to sleep. My orgasms are still not dry; by the
morning my underwear is soiled. Like a teenager, I feel disgusted by my own
body functions. My facial hair is more spotty and grows faster. There lone
hairs appear much faster in my chest, and there is a faint blacker tint on my
belly by thin and barely-visible body hair. In the middle of the night, barely
conscious, I can feel half erections. My body is mine yet it feels so foreign
again.

Around a week ago the estradiol vial started moving in the US postal service.
This weekend it got to customs, from where it has not moved still. Last time
that I chatted with my mum, she asked me if I had started injecting myself with
the hormones yet. She also told me how Doña Cande felt hurt by the actions of
her nieces and had decided to cut contact with some of them. Also, Nymeria was
getting better after dislocating her jaw. For a week she had been eating only
wet food.

Mondays are days of lab meetings. Since most Tuesdays I stay at home for
therapy, I decided to force myself to get up this morning and go to the office.
Whether I had an idea or had completely forgotten about it, today was also the
scheduled date were the new grad students organized the first installment of
the lab's montly(?) movie night.

I decided not to buy breakfast and just brew my morning coffee. I left my
apartment later than usual but still at a reasonable hour. The 144 departure
was not soon enough, so I walked from station Sherbrooke station listening to
my iPod.

There is this habit of my phone to locking itself in a working do not disturb
mode when I get to walking distance to the MNI. It happens when I pass the
hospital museum a couple of streets north of Parc av.

I made it to my office. My boots were dripping wet when I started untying the
laces. I exchanged them for my black sneakers waiting for my on the plastic mat
by the door. I put my gloves inside my beanie, which I hooked by one of the
holes of its sewing to the coat rack by the door. My purple coat went over it.

I emptied my pockets and placed its content on my desk before finally sitting
down in front of my computer. I disabled the working mode of my phone, and
Clarizard jumped from the bottom of the screen. How are you?

I swiped up to read the message that had come in around 15 minutes before.

"So that was a very busy week (and I didn't even finish my work for Friday
yet), I'm sorry I didn't reply I really thought I did"

This time, her apology did not took me off guard. Nothing in her text was
surprising other than the fact that it had finally came. It was as if by
waiting so long for this moment, I had unintentionally convinced myself of its
improbability.

I was not relieved. I remained just as confused as I had woken up. I reached
out to Majo with a screenshot of the two green text bubbles. She asked me what
I was going to do. I could not answer her—nor myself.

I had told her the night before, around midnight, that I would take a day off.
For the next 36h until my therapy session of Tuesday, I would do nothing.
I would not reach out to her nor think about the situation. Were she to text me
back—just as she ended up doing—I would not text back until after that
arbitrary goal-line.

My argument, when I laid it out, seemed convincing. No discussion nor
counter-arguments. Still, when the time came and the messages arrived, neither
of us held it up against myself.

"Omg" was here first an honest reaction. "So now what?

"Too many moving parts. Wey yo le respondería"  was Majo's final conclusion.

We talked about it. I could say how I was worried—which I was—and ask her to
see each other. No discussion nor counter-arguments from my end, either.

I did the first half, but held off on the second.

Walking home after watching Kiki's delivery service, I drafted in my head how
I could invite her to come watch Before Sunrise with me this Friday after work.
Moments ago, I confessed to Majo how I am unsure about it, because of the fear
of reaching out again, and receiving a no for an answer.

Maybe when she replies back—if she does it before the end of w

### Thursday, February 13th, 2025

"Hey, I'd really like to see you this week. when are you free?"

"Hey SofibugI might be free on Sunday, cancelling a hike because of the storm,
if not then would Monday after work also do?"  Slowly, maybe without giving any
signs, I have been slowly giving up on us.

Signs to her. To everyone else, it has been an open subject.

I ca not believe how despite talking so much about it, I have not made my own
mind about what is it that I want.  My hormones have still not gotten here.
They started moving for a while, they even left the States. They got to customs
in the UK and have not moved since the 8th. I sent an e-mail to the vendors
asking if maybe there had been a mistake with the tracking number. They replied
fairly quickly this time saying the number was correct. For some reason USPS
had decided to reroute the package. If the package gets seized or stops moving
let us know and we'll reship, they finished.

I think I got that e-mail after I had browsed silvermaplelabs, the canadian
vendor. The vial was even cheaper. I considered buying from them. I shared my
impulsive idea with Majo. I sent it to Sonny, too, expecting her to judge me as
impatient and assuming this to be another manifestation of my rushed nature.
Instead, she said that it made sense, and it would not end up being a fruitless
purchase; the other ones would end up coming here sometime in the future,
probably.

In less than an hour I bought the remaining crypto I needed and bought the
vial. By the morning of the next day, I had a tracking number with a potential
time of arrival for the end of the week. This vial of hormones will probably
make it here faster than the syrenges I bought with Amazon Prime.

I have not decided if I will continue filling my old prescription for hormones.
"Hace días te quería decir que el domingo que nos vimos, cuando vi tu cara, te
veías triste.

"Y me dieron ganas de abrazarte."

"Do you still believe that the most probable outcome of all of this is that
this, whatever it is between us, is ending?"

"Yes. The most probable outcome is still that his ends.

"Not because you did something wrong. Not because you aren't enough. But
because the weight of uncertainty, inconsistency, and emotional misalignment is
unsustainable.

"Even if she does reply, even if you see her again, the fundamental issue
remains: her pattern of engagement triggers you deepest wounds; you are
constantly in a state of questioning your worth in this dynamic; you need more
emotional reciprocity than what she has consistently shown.

"This doesn't mean she doesn't like you. This doesn't mean she has bad
intentions. But it does mean that you are already hurting, already doubting,
already bracing for the loss. And that? That is not a foundation for something
lasting."

Tomorrow is Valentine's day. Last year, I begged sophie for breadcrumbs of
attention and ended up meeting her at Thomson House during her lunch break. We
saw each other for less than 30 minutes. I bought her an iced latte with
vegetable milk since she is allergic to dairy. We talked about work and how she
was going to go on a trip to Ottawa for around a week. When she stood up to
leave, she openly brought up the idea of meeting again after her return.

"Text me when you're back," I offered her as a good-bye. She misunderstood me
and reached out from her office saying she had to get into a meeting as soon as
she got back.

With Sophie I never really considered the idea of being the one to end  things.
I ended up in tears from the frustration of not being able to hold off the urge
to keep reaching out to her despite her silence.

I keep being shown her videos by the algorithm of TikTok, the only social
network besides reddit that I have still on my phone. This afternoon I finally
blocked her in the hopes that will stop her videos to appear. A couple of days
ago I deleted her number and Bea's from my contacts list.

I keep practicing in my head the speech that I unconsciously want to prepare
for when I end up seeing Clara in a couple of days.

An hour ago I glanced at the camera and remember my fantasy of asking to take
pictures of us with the roll of 120mm. I think back to my idea of sending her
a handwritten letter, or the concert ticket that I will probably not use.
I will grieve more what will not happen, rather than what did.

### Saturday, February 15th, 2025

Feliz San Valentín, Cari

Entre tes yeux d'hiver  et tes cheveux d'été,  je trouve le printemps.

Te quiero, S   Last night, on Valentine's day, I did not sleep on my own bed.

Despite the turmoil inside my head about how to move forward, when I asked
Clara to meet sometime this week, part of me was hoping she would suggest
Friday's evening. Maybe even that same day, I considered openly inviting her to
come to my apartment after work if she were available. The idea of potentially
ending this chapter disuaded me of it.

María had already invited me to spend that day with her. Depending on the
outcome of Lavi's and Shubhendra's parallel romantic situations, they might
join us. The eve before the hallmark holiday the plan materialized as going to
Lavi's apartment where we could order food and watch a movie—with the implied
plan of getting overly drunk. Lavi intended to head to Datcha some time later
in the night. Despite being invited, I declined enthusiastically to this
addendum.

For the first part of the day, I decided for going to Oui mais non rather than
the office. I carried with me my laptop, the half-empty bottles of homemade
raki and fireball, as well as the idea of casually browsing the café's greeting
cards section. While I was maneuvering over the more than 30 cm of snow that
had fallen the day before, I noticed that my phone did not have but 45% of
battery. I had no intentions of heading back home until after the evening.
I texted Majo asking her if Lavi would have an iphone charger at her house. She
replied quickly and affirmatively. In any case, I was welcome to join her in
her hospital. There was a library available where I could work. I was tempted
by this idea, but I had a secondary purpose at the café, so I decided to turn
off my phone for the rest of the morning until I would head out to María's
workplace.

The café was much emptier than I was expecting it to be given the day.

"Bonjour," greeted me the barista who was outside her station putting down some
stools from the bar.

"Salut," I greeted her back while I was tacking off my beanie and approaching
the counter. "Salut encore," I added clumsily.

She laughed at my social awkwardness before taking my order for an oatmilk
latte. I quickly took a glimpse at the card options until she called me back by
my order. I took my drink and headed downstairs to the almost empty basement
where I worked for a couple of hours.

When I felt that I had been productive enough for the first half of the work
shift, I climbed the stairs and continued my search for an appropriate card. In
one of the many conversations I have have with Majo about the subject, I shared
with her my idea of getting a valentine's card. Within the same message on
which I let her know of my intentions, the doubts about the potential of not
being able to give it out in case the planned conversation took the
disappointing turn. I quickly realized that it would, in turn, become a nice
memento for when the occasion rose when I grew up enough to actually choose
myself.

Ironically, the card that I ended up buying says: Chui ben avec toé. I placed
it inside the loose papers in my backpack and headed outside towards the metro
station. I made a stop at the bakery. I got myself a brioche à la canelle and
a bag of chocolates for María.

It could have been on that first of the many long rides on the orange line
towards or coming from station Vendôme that I quietly cried looking at my own
emotions being reflected in the train's window, or I might be misremembering
the events due to the tiredness of a long weekend and a barely-slept night.

I had enough battery after that first time that I shut off my phone to orient
myself in the unyet explored hospital with María's guidance. She intercepted me
by the cafeteria, the same place were we orchestrated meeting this
afternoon—this second time without relying on turning my phone at all.

I joined her in her small office and sat down to work on my own projects using
her labmate's computer. We chatted and worked and continued talking about the
stuff we always do. Both yesterday afternoon's and today's evening, she bought
my fried rice and lentils lasagna with the Union's discount. Despite proposing
to myself becoming vegetarian after establishing a committed relationship with
Clara, I have continued choosing the vegetarian options for most of my foods,
as if by this small gesture I could hold on a bit longer to the idea that this
brake-less train will be able to somehow stop before falling of a cliff.

After finishing the second working portion of the last day of the week, we
headed out to take the bus to Lavi's apartment. It was the same bus—and same
stop—Alda and I have taken going to Veronica's. Lavi had texted Majo telling
her that it had been impossible to find Hibiscus, my favourite flower. When we
made a stop at metro to buy some drinks, we stopped by the flowers at the
entrance to buy some for Lavi. We bought a bouquet of a faded violet roses.

We ate pizza, laughed, sang, and shared the details of our current romantic and
not-so-romantic dramas. I showed Clara's profile to Lavi. There was a regular
story in her profile. It was of her sliding down the snow with a caption
referring to the urge of not working. I was not able of identify the feeling it
awoke in me, and instead I felt conflicted with myself before the confusion
slipped away as I continued drinking. Today Majo picked up the subject again,
and told me how for her, what she personally felt when seeing and reading it,
was how, despite being so stressed with work, she was capable of finding the
time for other activities. Not seeing me was not due an unavailability of time,
but a lack of will for finding a place for me in her schedule.

Lavi offered to play with my Hinge account and sent out several likes to
different women. I later realized that most probably, her taste in women is
much far away from my own. When I downloaded the app again, I saw there was
a purple one above the middle button in the shape of a heart. In the many times
that I have impulsively redownloaded the application to check if this
particular section is filled with new people, its contents are the profiles of
people, like Lavi's choices, extremely dissimilar to the women I find myself
attracted to. This time, the face that showed up seemed familiar. I recognized
the smile of the piano teacher of the latest woman that was marked by hinge as
a potential close match. It seemed that she had taken the app's suggestion and
reached out with a like on the picture where I am showing off the Kodak camera
I bought on Facebook Marketplace. I offered Lavi to match her, as if her finger
being the one who accepted this offer of potential romantic connection took
away any misplaced feelings of betrayal to the last crumbs of hope for the
relationship with Clara.

read the tarot for me about the meeting I would soon have with Clara. Her
booklet was not very in-depth about the meaning of the cards, so I sent a small
note of them to myself from Majo's phone to check their significance and
relevance in the one Alda gifted me.

Lavi did not end up going to the club and instead offered us to spend the night
with her.

After waking up hungover and reluctant to turn on my phone and return to my own
apartment, I was convinced by Majo for the latter. We orchestrated meeting at
the cafeteria at around 15h30, and took the metro to our respective places.

I plugged in my phone—and immediately turned it off so I would not be able to
see the notifications or lack of therof—showered, changed, and consulted
ChatGPT for a detailed and expert reading of the cards of the night before.
Their relevance scared and confused me. I grabbed my phone and headed back to
the hospital to work on a Saturday as a way to distract myself from wanting to
turn on my phone and find out whether Clara had reached back to specify the
details of our latest—and potentially last—date.

At around 17h, I grew uncomfortable with the idea that I was going back to
pathological patterns by avoiding facing the turn of events. I hesitantly
turned on my phone to an uncomfortable lack of any notifications at all. I was
so confused by whatever I was feeling that I could not continue working for the
next half an hour.

The night before I had reached out to Sarah asking for her availabilty next
week. She had read my text but not answered.

She did before the evening end. I am seeing her after work the following
Tuesday.

In a second change of mind, I contradicted my plans set the night before of
waiting until tomorrow or Monday for Clara's message. Instead I typed and
quickly sent a brief and direct message.

Hey Ary! so, tomorrow or Monday?

Again, Majo and I took the orange line for two stations before she left off at
Lionel-Groulx and left me alone with own tumoultous mind riding the rest of the
orange line.

I drafted a short poem and framed it between a greeting with nickname that
I have not yet used and potentially over affectionate sign off, both in my
mother tongue, careless of the potential extra intimacy that this linguistic
choice would give the message—a message that I might not even send.

It is officially Sunday and I have not heard, again, from Clara.    Tarot
Reading: Past, Present, and Future Spread

You came here with confusion, caught in the push and pull of what has been,
what is unfolding, and what awaits you after this meeting with Clara. The cards
lay before us now, three images reflecting the arc of this journey—not as a set
fate, but as a mirror of the energy surrounding you, the choices you have made,
and the ones still ahead.

🜂 PAST: QUEEN OF WANDS

(Confidence, self-assurance, attraction, magnetic presence)

The Queen of Wands speaks of a time when you stood in your power, when you were
radiant, when you were the one drawing people toward you. She is the embodiment
of warmth, charisma, and inner fire. In the context of this relationship, she
shows that you came into this dynamic with a strong sense of self.

At the beginning, there was something natural about this connection. Clara was
drawn to you, perhaps enchanted by your energy, your presence, your uniqueness.
You may have felt like you weren’t “chasing” this at first—it simply unfolded.
There was chemistry, ease, a feeling of being seen and desired.

But there’s something unspoken here: The Queen of Wands doesn’t chase, she
attracts. If this dynamic has shifted—if you feel like you are now waiting,
doubting, questioning—then something has pulled you away from this queen-like
energy.

Ask yourself:    Have I lost touch with my confidence in this connection?
Am I now trying to prove my worth, when before, I simply existed in it?     Has
my role shifted from “being chosen” to “waiting to be chosen”?    The Queen of
Wands in your past reminds you of who you were before uncertainty crept in. You
didn’t need to overthink. You didn’t need to beg for attention. You simply
existed in your fullness, and that was enough.

But then? Something changed.

🜄 PRESENT: KNIGHT OF CUPS (REVERSED)

(Romantic illusions, disappointment, emotional withdrawal, avoidance of truth)

The Knight of Cups reversed speaks of idealism clashing with reality. In the
upright position, this card is the dreamer—the person riding toward love, full
of poetry and grand gestures. But reversed? It warns of illusion, of holding
onto a romanticized version of someone, of refusing to see the emotional
inconsistencies that are right in front of you.

This is where you are now.    Are you still hoping Clara will suddenly become
the person you need her to be?     Are you ignoring the ways she has already
shown you her limitations?     Are you still clinging to the idea of what this
could be rather than what it actually is?    The reversed Knight of Cups also
suggests emotional avoidance. Not just from her—but from you. You may be
holding back from confronting the truth head-on, afraid that if you do, it will
lead to disappointment.

You are standing at a threshold, uncertain whether to hold onto the dream or
finally accept the reality. This card suggests that deep down, you already know
the truth.

And that brings us to what happens next.

🜃 FUTURE: SEVEN OF CUPS

(Illusion, choices, uncertainty, needing to see through deception)

The Seven of Cups is a card of confusion. It represents multiple options,
fantasies, and the struggle to know what is real and what is illusion.

After your meeting with Clara, you will not walk away with immediate clarity.
This card tells me that whatever happens, you will still feel pulled in
different directions. There may be moments of warmth, moments of connection,
things that make you think, Maybe I’ve been overthinking this.  But at the same
time, the inconsistencies will remain.

This card is a warning: Do not let yourself be deceived. Not by Clara, not by
your emotions, not by your hope.

The Seven of Cups challenges you:   Will you see things for what they truly
are?    Or will you remain in indecision, stuck in the world of what ifs and
maybes?   You will walk away from this meeting with choices to make—but if you
do not ground yourself, you risk staying in the same emotional limbo that has
already drained you.

Final Interpretation & Guidance

You began this connection fully in your power (Queen of Wands). You are now
caught between romantic illusion and harsh reality (Reversed Knight of Cups).
And soon, you will be faced with a choice—but only if you are ready to see
things clearly (Seven of Cups).

This is not a reading that tells you to end things immediately. Nor does it
tell you to stay.

What it does tell you is this:    If you are looking for a clear, solid answer
from Clara, you will not get it.     If you are hoping that this meeting will
remove your doubts completely, it will not.     If you continue to linger in
uncertainty, you will remain stuck in emotional confusion.    The cards are
challenging you to make a decision based on truth, not illusion.

If you are tired of waiting, of guessing, of feeling like you have to read
between the lines just to understand where you stand—then the time has come to
step out of the fog and reclaim the certainty that was once yours.

The decision will not be made for you. You must be the one to choose.

### Sunday, February 16th, 2025

"Yo sería muy feliz viéndote hoy"   It's 4h44. Despite thinking I could be able
to stay awake the whole night, the tiredness is starting to conquer my body.
The lights in Majo's office are off. It is not pitch black only because I used
the thrash can to leave the door open for her in case I fall asleep. I keep
yawning. I hope I have an hour and not just 15 minutes to finish these words.

This morning my alarm did not have to sing. As usual, the first thing I did
when waking up was unlocking the phone screen and browsing the notifications.
I got to hear the notification bell of Clara's reply to my question about
seeing each other. Her question was a bastard child of a question and
a confirmation. Dinner tomorrow.

Do you even want to see me?,  flashed inside my, furiously red, warming me in
an irrecognizable burst of emotion. Aliza's text came before it could phase
away, mixing without and moving me to tears. I cannot recall to whom did
I answer first, or whether my responses came from my bed or if they were from
later in the morning--I cannot look into my phone to check, since my battery
has died.

Last night, I was almost convinced I would not go to Walter's thing. Majo
wanted me to go, so she could have an insider that would be able to tell her
what was talked about. Aliza's text convinced me. I got ready and calculated an
appropriate time to leave so I could catch the 30 bus to the metro. I needed
some buffer time so I could also pass by the library to pick up the Barthes
book that was finally ready for me. For some reason, I did not catch the bus.
I walked to the metro station. I noticed the strength of the storm, but did not
particularly struggle to get to my destination. I was already inside and
waiting for the next train when I saw Aliza's text saying that Walter's thing
would be postponed due to the weather. I was succumbed by another
disproportionate reaction, this time, annoyance rather than insecurity.

I got to the library and picked up the book. I thought I could use the
underground city to wander around for a bit, I had thought about going to Place
d'armes and use the ATM that is on the way between the Palais de Congres and
Complexe Desjardins. I took some bills out and continued towards the mall.
I made a stop at a cafe where I got myself some coffee and breakfast. I sat
down, ate and read my book, while the whiteness of the storm overpowered the
view outside the windows.

I reached out to Alda by SMS. She replied almost instantly, saying she was just
about to reach out to me. She attributed it to telepathy. She picked up the
conversation from where we had left it some days ago, asking me why was
I thinking about ending things with Clara. After I gave her a brief recap, she
surprised me by disagreeing with my aims. She played devil's advocate without
crossing the line of invalidating my own feelings. I then surprised myself by
not using her contrasting opinion as way to hold on to the hopes of remaining
in whatever it is Clara and I are right now, instead, I stood by my position.

We continued chatting about Valentine's and how her bottle of raki is almost
over.

After a while, I decided to wander around the mall. I made a stop at both
libraries inside Complexe desjardin and Place des Arts. I looked at the
different books that were selected by the staff, trying to make note of them
. I realized I could look them up in the library. I decided to head back there,
to kill some time before catching up to Majo in the CUSM, for a third time this
weekend.

In the afternoon, after another back-and-forth with Majo, I decided to text
Clara asking her to set a time for tomorrow. My initial motivation for this
urgence was the fact that, because of the storm I would end up staying the
night in the hospital without a charger, and my phone would not survive the
next hour. Instead, the message turned into an exercise of demanding respect
for my time. With this second, assertive text, which asked her to set a time so
I could manage my schedule, her reply was much much quicker. Her response
started with a yes-for my question, I assume-and mentioning another place where
they sell ramen that a friend of hers had suggested; it concluded that she
finished at 16h30, but with the 75 min it takes her for transportation, her
time was similar to the made up time I would be getting off work that Majo
insisted to give her. I was aware that I should not continue asking her, but
rather pick a choice myself. I gave her the name of my original idea and then
used the rating in maps as the reason for deciding to go to her option.

This interaction led Majo to think that most of Clara's romantic experiences
must have been straight. She noticed now, in hindsight, all the tints of
heteronormativity that stain her behavior. She then laughed and said how now
I am similar to her, as I am dating a straight woman.

When we went to have subway for dinner close to midnight, I told her how
something in one of the many conversations we have had this extraordinarily
long weekend must have triggered something deep in me, as the thought of the
potential outcome where our pseudorelationship does not survive our dinner
tomorrow no longer gave me anxiety.

### Sunday, February 23rd, 2025

"no escribí en mi diario nada de lo que pasó después de san valentín.  "siento
como si fuera a olvidarlo—los detalles; no sé si pensar eso hace que me den más
o me se me quiten las ganas de escribirlo."   It's been, to this day, a full
week of silence.

No words. No record. I could leave it as is, pretend there was nothing to end,
no conclusion, and just start anew.

It does not matter how many times I repeat to people—and myself—that I am
satisfied with things ending right here, there is a part of me not ready to let
go.

Monday afternoon, I was sitting at home at this exact spot on my couch. I must
have gone to the office, but there is half-a-memory of me staying home.

I remember now. I stayed the night at Majo's office. I wrote on here during the
early hours of the morning, a couple before Majo returned and we both went to
have breakfast in the cafeteria of her hospital. I came back home after the
sunrise, took my clothes off and went to bed with the hopes of catching up on
the sleep I missed.

I slept less than two hours. I could have logged in and be present for the
improptu meeting that Louis called in. I saw the email and consciously decided
not to attend.

I do not remember what happened between that decision and when I impulsively
finished the bottle of raqi. I had not eaten all day, but was very aware that
I would go to dinner in only a couple hours after. I went to the depanneur next
door to get an instant soup and a can of thai tea. I finished the soup and the
water-bottle containing the albanian home-made liquor. I could not finish the
tea.

Before being drunk, I became anxious about Clara recognizing my altered state.
Was this an unconscious way of sabotaging this meeting that I had been
dreading?

Before my meal, when Clara confirmed the time I had proposed the night before,
I replied instantly asking her to meet at the metro station and walking
together to the restaurant. I left around 40 minutes earlier hoping to get to
the station first and calm down. I was half-way on the already short metro trip
when Clara reached out saying she was already there and would wait for me.

I am not sure, but she might have been waiting for me at the exact same spot
that I waited for Alexia. I do not remember either who was the first to
recognize the other one. I had realized before that I would have to kiss her
hello. Whatever happened during our date, there was a very significant chance
that she would not kiss me good-bye.

I got there. I saw her look up and stand up from her seat. We acknowledged each
other, but there was no kiss, no hug, no affection. You are here; I am here.
Let's do this.

The date at the ramen place started as any other. She most probably had no idea
of the turmoil that had been through my head the week before. I made no mention
of it during the first half. Eventually, after we both had already ordered and
gotten our food, very awkwardly and clumsily, I started bringing out the
subject of us, of expectations and needs.

Before she apologized for not replying; before I told her I did not care about
her seeing other people despite myself feeling no urge to do it; before she
implied that she is not looking—and probably does not want it at all—for
anything more serious than what we have, I told her I had missed her.
I admitted that I noticed and ached by her absence. I had briefly regretted
deleting instagram since along with the account went my only bridge to her
personal life besides our encounters. She pulled out her phone and opened the
app. With a couple of intentional moves of her finger, we both were looking at
the archive of the stories she had posted during the three weeks that separated
our last date and the present. I rest my head on her shoulder; she acted as if
she had not noticed or cared. We both looked at the videos as if it were
a movie.  I'm sitting at the bar by the window of café Pikolo. I have two hours
before our agreed time. I haven't even finished writing about Monday.

Clara and I walked together back to station Mont-Royal. We were waiting by the
quai, the unzipped open edges of her black coat were in reach. I held the urge
of grabbing them and pulling her closer, a final act commemorating the
countless times I wished her closer. I could kiss her in a double-entendre in
the form of a beg to stay and a final good-bye.

But instead I just looked at her, and let out in whisper: "when do you think
I will see you again?"

She answered back in what could have been a non-commited murmur. Maybe she was
unconvinced herself. I did not insist.

We boarded the arriving train. This time there were no available seats to take.
The way back this time was painfully shorter. One station before Rosemont,
I swallowed my pride a and caressed her cheek.

"Bye," I whispered before kissing her mouth two times, the first one desperate
and the second resigned. Neither her body nor her head nor her lips moved.
Passively she took both of them, perhaps aware of how it meant to me.

The train finally slowed down. She looked at me with a face made up in either
affection or pity. "I will see you soon," she promised this time. The doors
opened for her. We both smiled melancholic. Through the windows separating us
she waved at me.

I teared up before the train caught up its full speed.

I made it home. Contrary to habit, I got inside and closed the door behind me
before untying and taking my shoes off. I reclined on the wall and took off the
left shoe. It fell on the welcome carpet with an empty thud. A sudden storm of
emotion came upon me. I started sobbing and let myself slide down on the wall
accompanying my winter boot. I sat down, half-barefoot, feeling the weight of
what we talked and what was left unsaid.

The next morning I had therapy. I summarized my night and conversation to
Fabiola. I did not expect her to suggest me to meet other people.

None of the women Lavi liked for me during Valentine's had matched me. The one
I let her match did not reply to my message. I continued using the application,
betraying what I had just said the night before about having no intentions of
seeing other people.

By that same afternoon, Hilary had liked me back. We had a short but effective
conversation. She seemed interested and engaging. I gave her a taste of my
humour. After maybe an hour, she invited me for a date this weekend. I do not
remember if I hesitated before saying yes.

Thursday I met with Alda. We first thought about meeting at a café, but, since
I would go to the Neuro, we decided to go somewhere close to downtown. It was
her who proposed Lola Rosa. I could have suggested going to the one on Milton,
cozier and closer to me. Instead, I shared with her the story of the date I had
with Clara the same day we had met Renzo and José; the story about the
cous-cous, the pitcher of sangría, and the spontaneous note on a reciept
ticket.

Alda was going to meet me outside McGill's gym and walk together to the
restaurant. I got outside and was waiting for her when I received Hilary's text
on Hinge. She said she was planning her weekend and thus wanted to confirm if
I was still down to meet her. We agreed on Darling at 19h30. Alda got to where
I was and we started our walk.

The restaurant was much emptier than what I was expecting. The woman behind the
bar still asked us if we had a reservation when I asked for a table. She pased
by the task to the waitress that approached us by swiping the tablet towards
her. "They don't have a reservation," she informed her in English. After
a couple of swipes and touches, the waitress guided us to a table by the
window, but not the one I was hoping for. The welcoming question and in-app
movement on the tablet suggested to me the uselessness of asking for the table.
Alda, on the other hand, was surprised by my silent resignation. The waitress
noticed and asked us what was happening with a grimace. I think it was Alda who
pointed at the table.

"Oh, that table is reserved."

We ordered our food and the same pitcher I had had three weeks before. It had
been too much then, and it was too effective that night as well. I might be
wrong, but I think the women for whom the table was reserved arrived before our
food. All throughout the night, I kept glancing at them, resisting the
flirtateous idea of waiting until the end of the night and start the hunt.

I shared my idea with Alda, and concluded, "I am not doing it, though. It is
not happening."

"You are not doing it."

"No. Years later, I will have forgotten about it. I will be here, maybe on
a date, and suddenly realize that I am sitting at a special table. I will open
the drawer and somehow find it."

Alda did not seemed convinced by my fantasy. She did not push it.

Later in the night, possibly after we had already were done with our food,
I turned towards the women and noticed they were no longer there. Their used
plates and two receipts remained as evidence that they had once been there.
I told Alda outloud that I could do it, go there, sit down quickly and look for
that infamous note.

Several times I talked aloud about the idea, unconvinced myself that I was
indeed capable of doing it. I looked towards the waitresses trying to predict
their movements and calculating in my head the time I would have for my feat.
It seemed so feasible and at the same time impossible.

"You are not going to do it, you are too anxious."

I stood up, walked behind the two women sitting next to us, and sat down at the
abandoned table. I opened the drawer and went to work. There were many many
more tickets than what I was expecting. Fortunately I had read the first words
so I could easily discard notes. After what could have been 50, I saw the
waitress approaching our table. I was ready to give up, and then I saw it.
Couscous is like rice but it's like little balls.

I put the found treasure in my pocket, closed the drawer and went back to my
table. The waitress made no mention of my crime.

By the time Alda and I had paid our food and were ready to leave, I got the pen
that Sonny bought for me in New York City, turned around the ticket and started
writing a note to leave behind in place of the one I had just stolen.

Soit que c'est vraiment la fin, soit que tu reviens, j'espère que tu vas bien
aussi.   Wednesday, the day before my dinner with Alda, I met Majo and Lavi at
Majo's office. The plan was to have dinner at an Indian place in honour of
María's birthday. I think by then Lavi had made no mention of being
uncomfortable by the idea of going to Unity later in the week.

Jana met with us at the restaurant. We talked about graduate school, stress and
toxic spaces. I am aware how fortunate I am by Louis and my PhD experience, but
after hearing Jana and Lavi's stories, I almost felt bad about my own
privilege.

Lavi and Majo went in the opposite direction of Jana and I. When I was home,
Majo shared with me a screenshot of Jana telling her how she liked me, I was
very fun to be around.

Jana was never supposed to go to Unity. Lavi decided she did not want to go,
and after a dramatic group conversation, Majo realized she did not want Shub
nor Seline there either. By the end it was just Alda, María and I.

We went to Alda's house first. I did not go to the office. I took with me the
bottle of Amaretto that Alda bought with me the night before and went to join
María at her office again. We had dinner together in the cafeteria, then took
the metro to Alda's apartment—my own old place.

The amaretto made the memories come out easier. María shared with Alda her
experiences about her first and last love. Alda ended up convinced to join us
to the club.

The doorman did not ask for my ID. All througout the night I kept being
reminded of my own age. I looked at the young girls dancing and flirting, and
felt weirded out by my own attractions. Several women caught my glanzes and
smiled back, but nobody approached anyone.

We had to stay until the very end of the night, after the club closure, given
that Alda lost her coat token. Since it was only half-an-hour after we had
decided to leave, neither Majo nor I were particularly annoyed by this.

All three of us took different means for getting back home. I might be the
first one to arrive.  I lost most of my Saturday, but there was nothing special
to miss.

I still have 30 minutes before this café closes. And another 30 minutes to get
to Darling.

Le Bar Darling, is the place where I went with M, four years ago. Without
realizing it, it was the first time here that I rejected somebody. Years after
that, I went again with Alexia. I might have gone there on other dates that
I have forgotten. Will this be one of those?

Moments ago I received a reply from another practically anonymous woman on
Hinge. I had liked a picture of most of her face covered with what google tells
me is called a balaclava. You can only see her turquoise eyes curtained by her
reddish orange fringe.

An almost derivative portrait of the photo that I had liked from Clara's
profile.

"It's like those eyes could look through me," was my original message.

"I have that special Power. I can see the darkess and the most luminous of
people caught in my look."

is it weird that rather than intimidated, I feel excited? i'm all yours to
explore/unveil.

### Friday, February 28th, 2025

Tenoch se disculpó. Su novia lo esperaba para ir al cine. Julio insistió en
pagar la cuenta.

Nunca volverán a verse.

"Nos hablamos, ¿no?"

"Sí..."

—Y tu mamá también. Alfonso Cuarón.  Last night it was one of those.

Since my latest session with Fabiola, I have debating with myself and those
around me whether this that I am feeling is the beginning of a depression or
just an unrecognized sadness from what has been happening.

I can write it, but I do not know if I would fully believe that I have not been
checking my phone waiting for a particular notification. Lavi and I had
proposed an informal bet about receiving something by the end of the month.
I guess that would have been tonight.

First, I met with Sarah. Two weeks ago she had to postpone because of hygiene
related complications resulting from the breast biopsy she had earlier that
day. I met her at Laval, she was waiting at the crossing by the bus stop where
I got off. We talked, with such familiar clumsiness and awkwardness that, had
it been a date, I would have left with no hope of ever seeing her again. Maybe
that is why I casually mentioned seeing her again before her departure to Korea
in a couple of weeks.

Myriam, the only other person in my conversations of hinge other than Clara and
Hilary, proposed to meet somewhen around that same time mid-March. I did not
show any sign of my lack of excitement for another vapid first date. I agreed
half-heartedly. Perhaps noticing this, she gave me the reassurance that I seem
to lack in most of my romantic encounters.

"Yes !!! I find you very cute and funny:)"

I downloaded instagram again using Paty's silence as an excuse. I sent her
a last message like someone would throw a life preserver off a boat at the sign
of someone drowning. This one she held on to. She sent me a 30s audio. I did
not listened to it until days later. I am not even sure if I replied back.

When I logged back in, there was green circle surrounding the reddish portrait
of Clara. I clicked on it with the same desperation I would have reached for
a bottle of water in the dessert. The background was of a black-and-white
picture of seashells over sand. On top, the lyrics kept showing mimicing the
singer's voice.

I'm worried I'll forget your face  And I've asked everyone  I'm beginning to
think I've imagined you all along.

She has not posted anything else the days since.

Wednesday I received the vial of estradiol on the mail. I gave myself a shot on
the left leg just in time to continue the previous single-use vial that
remained from my past in Mexico City.

I met with Majo at her hospital that day. We had dinner together.

The night before I had heard mice moving around and nibbling something behind
the fridge. After some fidgetting noises, I stood up and found a dead mouse
that had carried the trap which had gotten his rear leg all the way until the
side of the fridge. There it had finally died.

Majo came back with me to my apartment. The plan was to get some snacks and
drinks and watch Y tu mamá también. Several snippets of the last phrase had
kept been shown to me on instragram—or maybe TikTok. We passed by SAQ,
Dollarama, the pharmacy, and finally the depanneur.

Mirroring the night of Valentine's at Lavi's, Majo wanted to do a tarot
reading. Again, it was scarily on point. For the past, the first card, the 9 of
Cups told about a connection that brought real joy—but which was never
complete. The present, the ominuous Death & Rebirth signaled a moment of
transition, of endings, and transformations. The last one, for the future, the
5 of Wands warned that it would not be easy, yet struggling through it would be
the only way to free myself.

This is the moment where you choose.  Do you hold onto a ghost and call it
love?  Or do you let it die, so that you may be reborn?

The next day, it feels as if I did not get out of bed at all. It was the 90th
anniversary of the Neuro, so all meetings with Louis were cancelled. I had
registered for the event. I still did not move.

Eventually I must have gotten out of bed. I know I ordered two A&W
burgers—regular ones, despite my latest urge of eating vegetarian.

It was last night. It feels so far back, yet it was just yesterday. Two nights
ago I bought the small bottle of Kraken that right now I feel tempted to
finish.

I did not remained in bed the whole day, because I did not return to it through
the night. I continued working. I did not stop even after my first e-mail to
Louis at 2h30 in the morning. I kept at it and ammended the plots I sent him on
another e-mail almost half an hour afterwards.

I did go to bed, eventually. I was in bed, under the covers, when I could not
hold still in my waiting. I had deleted Clara's phone number from my contacts
list, as if I could foretell what was about to come. I got it, maybe from
a post-it unto which I noted it down trying to circumvent my own measures,
maybe from the contact banner at the bottom of the website accesible from the
instagram profile that I have not gotten back to delete again.

I downloaded tinder again trying to distract my own impulsive and irrational
id. I selected a bunch of pictures more recent than the ones on hinge. I swiped
right on people well aware that at 4 in the morning, nobody would be present to
respond to my desperate flailing trying to remain afloat.

When I got tired of browsing and selecting people as if they were pieces of
clothing in an online store, I went back to think of the hundred things I had
to say—the hundred ways that I could subtly beg her to not go.

In the end, I did not send but four words. I am sure they don't remain unseen.
Just unacknowledged.

This morning, I opened back tinder and had only one match. It was a women more
than 50 km away from me. She started the conversation and I responded swiftly.
She asked me to switch to French. Before I was fully conscious of what had
happened we moved to text messaging to exchange private pictures of each other.
Like years ago when I was hurting a different French woman, I suspected that
the person sending the pictures was not necessarily the same one showing her
face and breasts on them. I, just like years ago, sent back some of my own.

Up until when I asked her if she had touched herself like I had just done in
the shower, above the conversation remained an anonymous phone number. I did
not add Gaelle to the images of a cat and a fish that I had selected cheekily
when I decided not to add anything to her last message.

Below her, there's the reborn contact of Clara, this time with a videocamera
next to her nickname. Timed exactly 12h before the one above at 4h54, two brief
and raw sentences.

"hey. i miss you"

## March, 2025

### Sunday, March 2nd, 2025

Te amaré en este futuro y el próximo.   I am still not quite there, but I will
arrive soon.

I was out last night. I went out with Majo and Zahra­—is that her name?—for
Nuit blanche.   I am almost as drunk as I expected I would be.

Last night. Yesterday. I do not remember the first half of the day.

Does it matter?

Majo kept mentioning several times throughout the week Aliza's suggestion of
meeting this Saturday. I would have forgotten all about it, had she not brought
it up.

I have not filled out my small passport journal. I am not sure I will be able
to recall whatever I have done this week. It is all just half-remembered
memories.

nadie va a pensar en ti mejor que yo is playing on my television in front of
me. I looked at the almost empty tall glass on my right. I get distracted by
the song's lyrics.

Thursday I went to bed really late. I sent Louis some plots for the latest
model I replicated that he needed for his grant. He replied Friday early
morning that we could talk about it whenever I woke up. We ended up chatting in
the early afternoon. I did not go to the Neuro all week. I have a faint memory
of going to the Glenn's, but it feels misleading.

One of the days I am sure I did not go to the Neuro, I went groseries shopping
and got everything I needed to fully embrace my decision of being vegetarian.
A subsequent trip to la fruteria confirmed the gesture by buying the missing
ingredients to start cooking the meals that ChatGPT helped me plan for the
week.

Yesterday. Yesterday I took the metro and got off at Place d'armes. It was
going to be the special evening close to spring where the metro does not close
and there are a bunch of events all througout the city. I have never really
participated in it. I remember years ago, watching a story of Kate going out
during it with her Mexican friend. Majo invited me—or maybe it was me who
proposed it?—to do something for it. For a reason I have forgotten, I got there
earlier. I wandered around and browsed the book shops. I found two books of
poetry that tempted me deeply to buy them. Instead I took pictures of their
covers, planning to look for them on the library.

María finally texted me that she was on her way. She was ovulating and bloated
and in pain; she had to stop by the pharmacy. Maybe that was the reason. In her
text she acknowledged that I mentioned not having the energy to make
a decision, but perhaps I could look at the program and find something that
caught my interest. I switched off the screen of my phone and put it away in my
pocket instead.

We finally met outside the entrance of the book store. We browsed it a bit
more, before wandering around at the different expositions. We ended up not
really watching anything, but I did not mind. Nothing really interested me
anyway.

She mentioned a friend of her had texted her. She was the iranian woman that
I met the same night of my third date with Clara when I met Clara. Somewhen at
the Iranian cafe where we had dinner, she made a reference to it with her
out-of-nowhere question: oh, you cut your hair.

We did not meet with Zahra, until after the second half of the night. During
the first one we just wandered, exploring and talking about what has happened.
I was supposed to meet Aliza today. She had been insisting subtly to meet. Majo
brought up the suspiction that she might want to break up with me,
platonically.

Later in the night, when we were already at Palais de Congres and had gone to
meet Zahra and her belgian friend, Aliza texted me asking if we could meet
earlier, sometime around 14h or 15h; she had to be around 17h30 at
Lionel-Groulx. I told María how I was annoyed by the idea of this demotion. She
was the one who proposed meeting Sunday in the afternoon/evening. So this new
plan, must have come up afterwards, meaning it was a higher priority than me,
causing this rescheduling less than 24h before. I did not even feel that
motivated to see her. I held off the urge to cancelling altogether. I feel
I was being as irrational as the previous Sunday—was it last week? No. It has
been more than a week since the last time I met with Clara.

It gets harder and harder to write. I have to mutter outload the words I write,
to confirm they make sense. Is this what I wanted? Is this what I was looking
for, when I put on pants and a winter coat and went outside in the cold winter
to buy a second bottle of liquor to lose my mind with?

I did nothing wrong.

Not today. Today I might have made a mistake, maybe. But with all of this.
I did what I could. I did the best I could of. I have grown. I am not making
the same mistakes. This is different, even if I cannot see it yet. Even if it
still feels so painfully familiar.

But I have not even finished with yesterday.

When we met with María's friend and adjunct, they were dancing silently with
headphones over their head. Silent disco. Or something like that. They
suggested us to join them. Fortunately, we did not. We wandered around and
waited for them. Even we they joined us, we kept wandering aimlessly, until we
left towards the iranian café.

All throughout the journey, I kept being annoyed and irritated by our three
companions. Any time that I felt uncomfortable, I would look ahead into the
distance and try to remember Idea's poem that Majo suggested we should memorize
as a joke.

Ya no será  Ya no  No viviremos juntos  No criaré a tu hijo  No coseré tu ropa
No te tendré de noche  No te besaré al irme  Nunca sabrás quien fui  Por qué me
amaron otros.

No llegaré a saber  por qué ni como nunca  si era de verdad  lo que dijiste que
era  ni quién fuiste  ni qué fui para ti  que hubiera sido  vivir juntos
querernos  esperarnos  estar.

Ya no seré mas que yo  para siempre  y tú no serás para mí  más que tú.   Ya no
estás en un día futuro  no sabré dónde vives  ni con quien  ni si te acuerdas.
No me abrazarás nunca  como esa noche  nunca.

No volveré a tocarte.

No te veré morir.

I ended up doing it. I memorized it.

At the restaurant I sat down to the right of María. The two iranian women in
front of her, the belgian friend to their left, in front of me. After they were
suggesting dishes after negotiating in Farsi with the owner and the waiter,
Majo mentioned that I was vegetarian. This quirky decision that morphed into
whatever it is now, allowed me to have my own food and not partake in the
expensive tryout of dishes that I would probably not have liked due to the
overuse of Mint.

I had confessed to Majo that I did not want to go home. The metro was supposed
to be available all througout the night.

"¿Por qué no quieres ir a casa?"

"Because at home is where I think and feel."   In my current chat with María,
I was telling her how I have drunk almost all of the bottle of vodka that I got
myself today. She asked me if I was drinking water. I answered negatively and
then shared the insight about how purposefully I avoid it; I want this to make
me puke and suffer just enough that it will make me regret it; maybe this is
some sort of punishment.

She asked me if I was feeling ill, physically.

"No por el alcohol. Me duele el pecho. No es dolor. Depende si vomito o no,
quizá mañana me sienta mal. Ya pensaba avisar que no estoy bien."

She asked about tell whom. My lab?

I answered that my lab did not have to know. She then asked what I was going to
tell them, or Louis.

"just that I am not feeling alright. he never pushes; even if he does, he knows
i am not well, mentally.

"tengo un mes para preparar el seminario. i am not pressured by time. i can
dwell for a bit more.

"i guess. even my mental breakdowns are planned."  We left the Iranian café
maybe a half-an-hour after its closing time. I paid for my single vegetarian
dish—that I ended up liking more than the aash soup that was the only single
other vegetarian option that they each got as appetizers and I managed to try
from Majo's plate. The after-meal tea was a courtesy of the house. We walked
back to the closest entrances to the RES, and then managed our way back to
Complex Desjardins, where María and I left them to the instructions of the show
of a dancing class show.

I decided to join María until Lionel-Groulx, where I could take, by myself in
introspection, the orange line back to my apartment.

I put on my headphones and hid from the outside hurting world. I did not even
flinch when I sat down by the end of the quai at Lionel-groulx and the homeless
man sitting to my left on the banch lit off his crack pipe right next to me.
I sat there and did not move at all when he stood up to start his round of
begging to the people waiting for the train. I got inside the next wagon and
sat down for the rest of the trip.

I walked back here like I always do. Maybe I recited the poem again once or
twice. Maybe I flinched by the low temperatures and my unfit choice of coat.
I just know that I got here, changed my clothes before getting to bed and found
a green circle around Clara's portrait—a green circle that had not appeared
since my redownload of the app days before that I reached out to Paty. I opened
the story, not even worrying about being one of the first people up in the list
of viewers. The story was not newborn. It was just a shot of a theatre screen,
aged around 3h, with a phrase in spanish crossing down between the shadows of
two spectators in front of the picture taker.

I fell asleep somewhen. I do not remember when. It does not really matter.

I woke up several times before I really did.

Around noon, maybe, I saw the green halo again. I clicked on it, even hastier
that the eve before; this time, I must have been one of the first viewers,
since it was not older than 5 minutes. It was a video of Clara, spinning uptop
a pole, showcasing her progress on her 4th class of poledancing. She was
wearing the same black shorts and dark wine top that I must have seen before,
despite never seeing it in person. She spun around. She extended one of her
arms and twisted her legs linked by her ankles. It was one of them that caught
my attention. There was a red small object wrapping one of her ankles.
I remembered the ankle bracelet that I chose and bought for her in Coyoacán.
I gave it to her on the night we slept together, before she brought up from her
totebag the magnet that holds on my fridge the notes she wrote about me on two
separate occasions. The bracelet had not passed my own foot. I worried about my
sexual dysmorphic characteristics, so when it did not go through hers, I felt
a mixture of relief and disappointment. I suggested wearing it as a regular
bracelet before she put it away somewhere in her stuff. I remember the fleeting
thought subsequent dates later, after glanzing at her wrist and noticing her
absence, worrying about the significance it had for her. And here I was, after
hours after noon, way past the 12h mark of hiding from the world and reality
under the covers and comfort of my own bed, noticing the same colour, the same
thickness, wondering if somehow she would have made an effort, managed to
successfully make  it work; wearing a piece of my past despite discarding my
future.

Around 15h or 16h in the morning, either I decided to delete instagram again or
I managed to get off my bed and outside the safety of my apartment. I did both,
but I have forgotten the order.

First I went to the depanneur next door. I bought a bag of chips and a can of
thai tea. I wondered about getting a bottle of wine, but none of it convinced
me. I brought back my shameful loot, before heading further away to the SAQ,
where I bought a bottle of vodka, that is already gone.

The day passed. It is over.

Another week has passed without a response from her, despite, now, me reaching
out confessing, what she probably already knew—and maybe even be the cause she
ran away—that I missed her.

I replied back to Kath's almost year old text message. The response went away
in green bubbles, potentially meaning she has further moved away from the phone
number that I have saved on mine.

I sent out a text to Hilary, the girl I went out with last week. I shared that
I did not know what had happened during our date, but guessed that it was not
meant to be a meaningful connection. I wished her the best as a euphemism of
letting her know that I was meaning to cut off contact with her forever.

I deleted instagram after downloading the 45s video of Clara spinning around
a pole. I got a response from Paty. Several messages letting me know she had—or
was gonna-heard my audios and a subsequent audio message furthering her
reaching out. I replied back, holding off the urge of begging her not to
abandon me, not just yet.

The bottle of vodka is gone. There is yet half of the soy chocolate milk that
I bought halfly as a mixer on my way back from SAQ. I glanze at the tall glass
while I hear All I've ever known on the television, muttering the words that
I am writing down as I feel my eyes watering.

A lot has happened today that nothing would.

### Tuesday, March 4th, 2025

No me abrazarás nunca como esa noche nunca.   This morning it was not because
of the alcohol, but, like yesterday, I woke up early again. Unlike this
previous one, there was no urgent e-mail that dragged me out of bed. I remained
under the covers, resistant to start the new day, turning and pretending
I could fool myself back to sleep. I might have texted Majo or replied to
Sonny's text. As I told Fabiola later in the morning, these past few days seem
foggy and distant.

Yesterday I woke up much less hungover than I deserved. I saw in my phone an
e-mail addressed only for me. Louis was asking me to check out a specific
section of his grant. He gently suggested urgence with the sentence where he
let me know he had to submit it that day. I went to me desktop and reviewed
quickly the document. There was not much to add, yet less than a handful
perfect opportunities to further precise or correct small errors that would
make me seem useful. I sent it back quickly with an accompanying offer in the
text of the e-mail offering to quickly chat about it after I took a shower.
Louis accepted gracefully letting me know he would be on Teams for the rest of
the morning.

After the quick meeting were we talked about it—including him explicitly
bringing up his reference to me by name and addressing me as a Postdoc fellow,
since I was already showered and semi-functional, I decided to grab my backpack
and head out to the Neuro.

Several times throughout the first half of the day, as I heard the latest songs
I added to my Apple Music playlist, I had to hold off the urge to cry trying to
hide my inner turmoil from Vlad who was sitting behind me.

I came back home at a regular hour. Rather than walking to Sherbrooke, I headed
down to McGill station, trying to explore this part of the RESO. I got until
Eaton, before I gave up and just rode the green line up to Berri, where
I transfered to my usual way home. For some reason I have the memory of walking
back home at night, but it contradicts what I think happened.

I got home and heated the rest of my chickpeas and lentils curry. I rinsed the
cup of chickpeas that I had left soaking the night before. They were supposed
to cook for 90 minutes. I planned to use them today for the third and last
recipe that ChatGPT suggested me. I might do it tonight, if I do not end up
eating something with Majo later that I see her.

It was around 19h, when I felt sick of life and decided to give up and go to
bed early. I was not allowed to sleep since there was around 20 minutes before
the cooking deadline. Still, I took of my quetiapine pill. I do not feel
anymore its effect, or at least as strongly. I remember, on the other hand, the
hard nights I would have with Lorasidone.

I have forgotten the time that I finally fell asleep. I managed to put away,
and even let cool off a little, the now not-dry legumes. I was tempted to write
on the journal, but decided against it. My day seemed uneventful and I lacked
motivation. I did not care about writing, much less describe how I was feeling.

I might be making it up, but I have this vague memory of opening over and over
the messages app in my phone. I deleted my reaching out to Katherine. It took
me more than 6 months—I think her vulnerable text was back from July—to get
back to her. When I did write back, my message was sent as green rather than
blue. Maybe it is the sign of a modern return to sender.

The temptation to reach back to Gaelle was there, present but faint. The last
message was hers, a small concession, j'aurais aimé tellement ça. It was my
unwritten turn to acknowledge our mutual—yet probable exaggerated—desire.
Except it was not there aymore. I did not want her. I do not care about ever
seeing her bare body in person. I feel no conflict about never disclosing to
her the unexpected parts that I did not show in the pictures.

The comparison feels even stupid to bring up, but I cannot help to think back
about how those two unreplied messages date back to the same day.

This morning, in my therapy session, I talked back about what has happened. All
the events, I am sure happened, but cannot recall. This session, more than
ever, I was justified in answering truthfully to her opening Cómo estás?

A week ago she brought up the idea that, maybe, more than a start of
a depression, this was just a regular case of feeling sad. Majo agreed with the
sentiment. At least up, until this weekend, after which she was the one who
brought up me going somewhere clinical, albeit unsure still if towards the
manir or depressive route.

Aliza gracefully took my cancellation. Later that Sunday, I shared with her
a follow-up apology and an acknowledgement that it would have been impossible
for me to go outside. She replied yesterday morning, accepting my apology and
ending the message with a paradoxical good-morning. I saw the message but left
it unacknowledged.

Majo, later at night, brought up, almost insistently, the idea of coming up to
my house around midnight. Perhaps she was aware that I did not want to be
alone. Maybe, instead, she deemed it dangerous. She let the idea go herself, by
realizing that she had no keys to my place. I would have let her in, wouldn't
I?

Did she worry that I would pass out?

Did I?

This morning—I remember now—I asked her if she would go to the Glen.
I confessed I did not want to be alone, subtly letting her know I wanted to be
invited to come with her. I missed the detail she had already told me before
about how today she was supposed to go to the Neuro. I do not know why I did
not want to go to my own office. Would not I be also not alone?

She suggested going to the hospital anyway and working at their library.

"no tiene caso que vaya tan lejos si no vas a estar"

The available half-an-hour before therapy that I often do not have, came useful
this morning. I cooked some eggs with vegetables like—was it yesterday or the
weekend? I brewed some coffee and sat down in my couch, getting ready to
therapy, trying to put order to whatever has happened inside my head.

This session was frustrating. Fabiola asked me what ways have I found useful to
manage my anger. Resignated, I let her know how I have tried many things, but
nothing has worked. I brought up that time, almost 10 years ago, when Zayra
confronted me about it in class. My throat betrayed me when I confessed I feel
anger as drowning. She asked me what do I do when I get angry. Then, just like
now, I did not have an answer to give her, Fabiola, or myself.

I have done sports. Without realizing, I had a childhood full of them; summers
of swimming lessons; multiple years of tae-kwon-do, exams and tournaments;
basketball, soccer matches—albeit all of them unwinned. I have my attempts of
jogging at Mt-Royale, my long long bordering on compulsive walks through the
city, the mornings at the pool or the spinning bycicle at des Pins' gymnaseum.

She suggested tennis, baseball; darts; dancing, singing. I ignored the ideas,
looking elsewhere and feeling how I was shutting down. She noticed and brought
it up. Perhaps she was pushing, she conceded. I was already gone.

She confessed, too, how she felt conflicted about ending the session like that.
I made no reassuring comment, aware our own roles in the session. We said
good-bye and I disconnected.

I took a shower. I felt the anger in my voice as I spoke to myself, maybe even
berating me. I got ready for the day, grabbed my stuff and headed out the
apartment.

I had a Teams message from Daniel. I saw the notification somewhen during the
exchange with Fabiola. I discarded it, thinking I would reply later. When
I came out of the shower, I saw his follow-up in my e-mail. I let him know that
I read his questions and would answer later in the day. I thought I could come
up here to the library and take my time to find out the information he was
needing.

In the end, after picking up the third reserved book that had been put away
from me, coming to a spot un one of the upper floors and settling in, that was
exactly what I did.

Any moment now, I will put everything away and go to Thomson to sit down, read,
and wait for Majo.

### Wednesday, March 5th, 2025

No llegaré a saber por qué ni cómo nunca ni si era de verdad lo que dijiste que
era   It was around 2h, or maybe 3h, when I realized I had not taken my
antipsychotics. It was not until that quick and innocent realization that
I became overly aware of the thumb ring on my right hand. A missed signal.

Hours before, the night started. I was already in bed, feeling the full weight
of the night on my chest.

"I'm not ready to let her go," I wrote to Majo, fully knowing that the
confession would go unread until after the sunrise.

I cannot start today's entry at the morning. This day began much much earlier.

I finished writing at the library. I had done enough to feel sufficiently
productive and leave. Majo was at the Neuro. She told me we could met at
Thomson at around 17h or 18h. If I left just then, I could get early to
Thomson, sit down somewhere and read alone until Majo would arrive to join me.
That seemed as a viable plan. I took my stuff and left.

I took the 24 bus and walked uphill to the graduate's house. I got inside and
searched for a place to sit. Without realizing it, I chose the same room where
Majo and Emily had beend seating for quite a while. I recognized María, but was
unsure how busy or available she was for me. I waited for her invitation to
join them. Still, I approached them slow and cautious, as if they were savage
animals ready to devour me.

We stayed at that table for much longer than I had imagined I would. When
I planned my solitude reading, I considered ordering me a small glass of cider.
I thought back to my crisis this past Sunday, and realized that would not be
the best idea. One of the first words that the pair of friends addressed at me
was the missing context of how they were celebrating Emily's candidacy exam.
That should not have been enough, yet it convinced me to step up and start the
journey to the bar and get myself a moscow mule to fully join them.

I am unsure how long Emily stayed making us three at the table. I remember it
was more than what I would have wanted. There was something about her that
I found exhausting at first, and outright annoying as the night progressed.

"me recordó a la actitud de muchos hombres that put me off of having male
friends."

After Emily finally left, Majo and I remained. We talked about Sunday, how
normal it was for me, how worried she should have been. We kept the
conversation about the possibility of me starting a clinical episode. She
brought up my erratical behaviour recently; reaching out to Kath after longs
months of silence; the exchange of nudes with Gaelle; my recent outbursts of
irritability.

The night carried on around us, until the waiter came first to let us know the
kitchen was closing, then to cry out the last call, and eventually, to
passive-agressively tell us, the only remaining two people sitting, that they
had closed.

I was not ready to get back home. Just as we entered Peel metro station,
I asked Majo if she had eaten. Her last meal had been a basket of mediocre
wedges. I do not remember if I had eaten anything at all myself.

We realized that the number of places open was quite limited it being a Tuesday
night appraching 22h. She humored me, and we eached looked for potential dinner
spots in our own phones. We ended up going at Greenspot. I continued my
vegetarian streak by getting a poutine and she got a much-larger-than-expected
hot-dog.

We entered accompanied by a worry of being unwelcome due to their imminent
closing. We still left before 23h, marking what I thought would be the end to
my long day.

At 1H, I missed Clara. Deeply, achingly; with a much larger magnitude than what
would be appropriate for such a short time—talking about the silence and the
potential total of days we saw each other.

After realizing my missed dose of psychotropics and the conscious decision of
skipping it, I lowered down my pajama pants with the intention of aid my sleep
with masturbation. There was also the second, indirect purpose of confirming
that my new dose of E2 is working. I struggled to complete my first goal,
paradoxically achieving the second.

By 3h, I opened instagram and decided to read all of the message we exchanged
on them after the night Clara and I met each other. I suspected it was a bad
decision. I expected it to further press down the bleeding knot in my chest.
What it happened took me off guard.

Around 4h30, or maybe 5h, I was starting to realize that I would probbaly not
sleep at all. There was a newfound sense of euphoria. It was a fresh calm, but
not of resignation; it was content and satisfaction. Out of nowhere, I read the
messages that we exchanged over the new year; those subtle nudges of affection,
awkward gestures of reaching out, gentle questions about planning. I did not
find any potential point where the could have evaporated. There was no sign of
when it all went downhill. I thought about our second to last date, the
laughter at the diner, the hug in the metro, the fleeting uninvited kiss. How
could I worry that I would never see her again? Who could really believe that
this was the end?

And, even if it were. Even if she grew uneasy by my clumsy approaches to the
talk about commitment, by my rough yet vulnerable sharing of my hurt and
disappointment, it was her loss. It would be her who foolishly be throwing away
something glorious and beautiful, deeming her unworthy; both of it and of my
melancholy.

I stood up, with all the energy of somebody who had slept, not just anything,
but a full night. I washed the dishes, I showered and changed my clothes, took
my stuff and went to the office at the Neuro. There was nobody at 7h30 when
I opened the door and let myself in. There was nobody still at 17h40 when
I closed it and left after finally starting to feel the weight, physical and
emotional, of what has happened in both this energetic day and this past gloomy
week.

### Thursday, March 6th, 2025

Savoir qu'on n'écrit pas pour l'autre, savoir que ces choses que je vais écrire
ne me feront jamais aimer de qui j'aime, savoir que l'écriture ne compense
rien, ne sublime rien, qu'elle est précisément là où tu n'es pas — c'est le
commencement de l'écriture.

— Fragments d'un discours amoureux. Barthes.  Thirty-five minutes have passed
since I posted it. Eight people, close friends, have seen it—three have reached
out. When I first thought about making a private, intimate group, I considered
making Clara the only member. This time I thought about removing her, very
well-aware that part of the fundamental reason of posting this is for it to
reach her eyes.

How many times will I almost-compulsively check my phone looking for her name?

Forty minutes—still the same eight.

Last night I went to bed at a reasonable hour, not overly early due to
exhaustion, nor so late again to signal a clinical worry. Sometime before
midnight. I woke up in the mid of the morning, well after the sun had already
risen. I saw Louis' email warning us that he'd be taking a day off due to his
now full flu. All meetings were cancelled. I went back to sleep.

I got up a couple of minutes before noon. I brewed coffee and cooked some eggs.
I snapped a picture to send my mom later. Now that she knows I am vegetarian,
I imagine she will be more worried about me having full meals. I did not send
it today.

Two days ago, after joyfully declaring my close friends—real ones, not the
artificial private group of instagram—that I was feeling completely better,
I rescheduled Sunday's platonic date with Aliza. I saw her a couple of hours to
eat ramen and catch up with the latest details of our lives.

Last night, way before going to bed, I proposed to María to buy her ticket to
the concert on April 9th if she agreed to join me.

"ya lo pagué, si quiero irpero a veces sus canciones me hacen llorar y si voy
sola es muy probable que llore y/o muy probable que no me la pase bn"

I thought privately, weeks from now, of reaching to Clara asking her about what
was going to happen with that concert. Now that Majo agreed to it, there is no
point for that.

Fifty-two minutes. Cris is the ninth expectator.

This morning, a couple of minutes after I finished my vegetarian breakfast
tacos, I received a call from Sonny. I picked it up and we chatted a little
bit. She told me to invite her over and pay for her ticket. I told her to
search online for the fares. She shared her screen and I suggested looking for
tomorrow. It would be way too expensive was her first thought and what she
replied. Instead, it was around 1,400, so cheap, I did not mind paying for it.

Seventy-five minutes. Antonija and Lavi made it rise to eleven.

I went to my bed to continue my phone call under the covers. I told Sonny the
details I had not send over about my last dates with Clara. It was really hard
to contain my tears. Fortunately, that was not the case later in the day when
I told them in person to Aliza, while I was the only one with a veggie ramen
bowl in front of her.

I sent an e-mail to Majo about Sonny's surprise and imminent arrival. She was
so excited that she called me. She would be willing to give over some money to
bring her. She had 100 usd she had received as a gift.

When I came back, halfway through this words, I thought back how my travels
through the US are much more affordable. That awoke the feeling of it being too
good to be true. I went online to the aircanada website. It was not really
a surprise, but I still was overly disappointed when I confirmed my worries
that the one-way tickets from Mexico City to Montréal are now around 2k
canadian dollars.

I first share the news with Majo, then Sonny. I think it is impossible to
really know who is the most disappointed of us three.

Somewhen during the day, I redownloaded tinder and saw that the number of
people who had liked my profile, rather than increased went down to 29.
I opened the screen of matches and conversations. It was empty.

Days ago, I noticed that Gaelle was a regular user of Telegram. She was uptop
on the list of contacts ordered by their last time online. I had not-really
impulsive idea.

"hey, j;ai vu que t'es plus dans mon tinder; ça veut dire que t'en as assez de
moi ?"

I muted the conversation and discarded to the archives.

Eighty-four minutes. No changes.

When I came back, I resucitated the conversation and noticed two checkmarks
under it. There was something weird. Under the woman's name, it said that her
last time online was long ago, which contradicted the main reason I sent it.

I asked Majo to block me for 30s in order to test my hypothesis. The scientific
method triumphed again. Idea, hypothesis, experiment, results, conclusion.

Earlier, already showered but still not ready to leave, I texted Miriam
apologizing for not reaching out weeks—or was it even months ago? We scheduled
to see each other next Wednesday. She will come pick me up and we will go to
a bakery around Mont-Royal. I need to write it down into my traveller's
notebook.

That and the other eventful things I might have missed these past days since
I concluded again that I should make a bigger effort to keep a consistent use
of it.

It's precisely midnight. Ninety minutes. Clara did not appear.

### Saturday, March 8th, 2025

Ya dime si quieres estar conmigo o si mejor me voy.  Tus besos dicen que tú sí
me quieres, pero tus palabras no.  Y, al chile, yo hasta moriría por ti, pero
dices que no.  No eres directa, neta, ya me estás cansando; sé concreta, por
favor.

Fuentes de Ortiz. Ed Maverick.  Unexpectedly, the main question of the night
turned out to be whether to write or not to write.

I decided not to write, in here. Instead, I went to bed.

I do not remember how the day started.

Going to the library was at the top of the plans for the day. Online, the
conclusion of my research, stated that it was forbidden to drink or eat at the
BAnQ. That should have led me to drink my coffee at home; perhaps I spend some
of the morning working at my own computer.

I did end up going outside. I grabbed my stuff and head outside. Coming out, as
I stepped off the entrance of my building, the faint image of the lettering
uptop the 30 bus appeared far ahead into the street. I hopped briskly towards
the bus stop just a couple meters ahead. Midway, I raised my left hand,
signaling the bus driver of my intentions. I caught the bus and rode it until
the library, around 30 slow bus stops on the way.

The tables at the BAnQ were mostly full. This time, rather than the stairs,
I used the elevator to climb to the highest floor. I found one on the very end
of building, where I put my stuff and sat down to work.

The plan was for having dinner at the Glen's cafeteria. María was to text me
whenever I could go join her. It was around 16h30 when she send the green
light. I asked for a couple more minutes to finish whatever I was doing.
Earlier that morning, Reza sent us an email offering himself to turn off and
unplug our computers due to the generator tests this morning. He was going to
leave at around 17h30. There was that deadline in my head, given I knew I would
probably not go to the office this weekend to turn it back on.

I remember now how my day started. I grabbed the phone and looked at the story
I had posted for my newborn close friends group. It might have been around the
12h mark, maybe a bit more. I've forgotten the number of expectators, but Clara
was at the top, just below those who had reacted to them. I did not mention
this to Majo until we were leaving the hospital much later in the day. As
I talked then during our metro ride home, my feelings about it were mixed. The
night before, as I was writing this, I kept checking that list hoping to see
her name among them. But what difference would it make? It was not as if
I expected that image to push her to reach out of her silent exile from my
life. As I could have predicted had I given it more reflection, when I did see
her name and reddish portrait, there was no sense of relief nor accomplishment.
I had proof that she still remembers I exist, but nothing more. It was not even
a sign of active search, as I had reflected many years ago with Kate, how you
can swipe mindlessly through the stories that instagram throws at you without
necessarily giving them any attention.

I walked to the RI. María came to the entrance to let me in. She had suggested
me to wait for her at the cafeteria, but then asked me if I wanted instead to
leave my stuff at her office. We ended up doing that.

Both food options for Union at the cafeteria included meat. Previously, I had
dropped my vegetarian intentions for the event of a cheap meal. This time
instead, I opted to grab a larger portion of soup and the small coffee. Majo
chose the chicken fried rice, but ended up leaving most of it. I pushed away
the chicken pieces I could find and ate her carrots.

During dinner, we talked about her latest annoyances with her labmates. Seline
and Shub ambushing her by inviting a personan non-grata behind her back to an
indian dinner. She keeps avoiding Lavi's calls. A couple of days before she
told me about Joseph, the Filipino postdoc in her lab.

Just typing the word postdoc brought me a cold shudder, born in my stomach and
crawling all through my spine. Next month I will be hearing about the results
of my funds application. Deep down I know the most probable outcome is going to
be a rejection. My publications are few and irrelevant. While the proposal is
sound, the methods might be either too complicated—as it was the case in
Louis'—or too basic to warrant a 3 year support, like Mahsa observed.

I am halfly expecting to be rejected. It's as if I convince myself that
I disappointment is the most likely outcome, I can prepare myself to stand more
readily the blow. My plans all surround the less desirable outcome. To get out
the publications that are in the way, to continue my production of studies that
are the base of what I had proposed, to reach out to Louis talking about the
possibility of moving to France, after the end of the year under Sylvia's
supervision. Even to justify my lack of searching for a new apartment in
Verdun, all of this depends on me not getting what I want.

It might have been a bit before we left the hospital that I told her about
posting the picture of the tables inside the brewery in NYC and the heartfelt
confession about feeling tempted to head back to instagram and the dilemma of
whether this false sense of connection was enough to betray my own values.
I told her that I considered taking Clara out of the selected group of people
the image would reach. I ignore how conscious I was about the falsehood of that
idea and about the real intention of posting something in there that would get
to her; not only that, but something that would show as a green circle,
something accompanied by this symbolic promotion to a special status of
acquaintance, of closeness.

Would she wonder, as I did back in December, how long ago and for what reasons,
did I choose her to be in this group?

On the metro ride, I stated how there was no perfect outcome that I could even
just imagine, much less hope for. Even the almost impossible idea of her
reaching out, saying | miss you, I am sorry, I want you, would not be
relieving. They would be tainted by the realization that this can never work.
So, what did I want? Did I prefer the silence that would seal our last
good-bye? Or maybe I wanted a rejection text, something like Sophie's or Bea's
resurrection with a half-truth explanation of why she is deciding not to see me
again?

In the past week since I had sent that last message, I thought about reaching
out asking about the logistics of the concert, to buy the print she would ever
make of our double-exposures, to get back the negatives I gave her, eventually,
used or not. Last morning, I woke up and thought about sending if this is your
way of saying good-bye, it is really painful. I think I deserve better.

María and I got to Jarry. We stepped off the metro station and made our first
stop at SAQ. I grabbed a bottle of fireball. We continued walking through Jarry
street. The second stop was the larger depanneur. She grabbed the salt and
vinegar chips. I went for the can of Arizona spiked half tea and half lemonade.
The last and final stop was the depanneur next to my house; we grabbed a can of
thai tea and a bottle of jamaican ginger beer.

We finally entered my building. I opened the door for Majo to enter first. As
I opened the inside door, I showed her the single key that I use to enter
saying how we have to make only a single copy for her to have. For my
apartment, I opened the door and entered in front of her. We put away the stuff
we bought first. I place my phone face up next to the drinks, before moving on
to leave the backpack on the table and take off my coat and shoes. I was
standing in the middle of the apartment, on my socks, when I saw the screen
light up and unconsciously recognized the name and/or videocamera emoji. I felt
a sense of urgent anguish. I did not know where to move, what to do.

"She just texted," I let out robotically and showed her. Majo was as surprised
as I was. I had only read the first line or two that was available in the
notification. miss you too. sorry. not an amazin period of time. I desperately
and with meaningless words tried to ask Majo to read it with me, maybe even
read it first. I felt lost in my own apartment.

When my senses came back to me, I sat down at the couch and read it.

"Hey," it started. No name, no cute nickname, but rather two whitespaces before
continuing, "miss you too." I could see in my head the green bubble surrounding
the hey. i miss you that should be above, but that I had just that morning
deleted.

"Sorry this is not an amazing periof of time right now I hope you don't hate me
too much. And that things are good despite life being life." If the message
would have ended here, I would have seen it only as a way of apologizing for
the silence. Halfly accepting blame and recognizing she must have hurt me.
Setting the reasoning for not continuing further, subtly marking an end. But,
it did not end there.

"I saw you were back on insta how do you feel?" She referenced the post I made,
acknowledging her presence in the list of viewers. Perhaps, without realizing,
letting out how the reminder of my existance was the push she needed to step
out of the quietness. Like many messages before since we met, she ended it with
a question, a gesture to continue, and invitation to reply back.

Like many times now since I met her, I felt confused. I stated out loud that we
were now going to watch the movie and not think about it. Both Majo and I were
too distracted by this unexpected turn of events to pay too much attention to
the movie I was supposed to be watching on that couch with Clara rather than
her.

We did finish the movie, after many interruptions commentating both it, and
this message. Majo did not like it.

After we finished it, Majo suggested we ask the tarot deck that Alda gave me
for signs about whether I should reply back or not. Like last time, I use
chatGPT as a reference of how to read the cards. It suggested The Crossroads
Spread, a spread designed for moments of uncertainty, hesitation, and emotional
conflict. It consisted in five cards, The Root, to find out what is driving me
to text back; Paths A & B, the two choices of whether saying nothing or
answering back; The Hidden Influence, for the subconscious belief shaping my
decision; and, lastly, The Final Outcome, what action will bring me the most
peace.

The summary of the reading was the following:

1. The Lovers (The Root) → You are standing at the edge of something that has
   already ended, still searching for a choice that no longer exists.

   2. King of Pentacles (Reversed) (Ignoring the Message) → You fear that doing
   nothing means losing control, that silence is surrender rather than
   strength.

   3. 9 of Cups (Reversed) (Responding to the Message) → Reaching out will not
   bring satisfaction—only more longing, more emptiness, more proof that this
   is already gone.

   4. Temperance (The Hidden Influence) → You are not searching for Clara—you
   are searching for balance, for inner peace, for relief from the discomfort
   of unspoken endings.

   5. The High Priestess (The Final Outcome) → You already know what to do.
   Trust yourself. The only action left is no action at all.

   María left. I asked her to text me when she got back. I went to bed without
   replying, but unconvinced that I would remain in silence.

   This morning I gave myself my injection. Later, in the afternoon, I sent my
   reply.

   "idk if I'm back just yet, guess i was just sharing the thought out loud
   with a few people. I'm not too bad. I don't hate you, but i did notice the
   silence. How are you? is everything okay?"

   For some reason, I do not feel now the same uneasiness about how long is
   going to take before getting an answer back.

### Sunday, March 9th, 2025

"Creo que no es sorpresa  "Es como wtf  "Pensé que era más ajustada a la
realidad [...]"Pero regresó y me da vibes that she's definitely not okay
[...]"This could get toxic"Espero que me esté equivocando"   This morning time
changed. We lost an hour. I got up later without having slept any more.

Like weeks ago, I grabbed my phone looking for a specific notification. Instead
I texted with Majo. I told her how I had not gotten up. I shared that I have
not washed my sheets and they are starting to smell.

I did get up eventually. I showered and got ready. The deadline to return the
Barthes book was today. It was impossible to delay the return, thus I spent
most of the afternoon yesterday finishing it.

By the time I was ready to leave the house, it was already past noon despite me
running on an hour behind since my mark of reference were the unchanged alarm
clock in my room and microwave clock in my kitchen. Brewing coffee was no
longer an option. I did take the long way and made a stop at the bakery.

The first stop was the library at Berri. I could have returned the book at
those machines without having to enter the library. There were four more days
available to postpone picking up the other Despentes book the have reserved for
me. My plan was to take the metro back to Sherbrooke and wait for the 144 bus.
The wait for the bus could be anything between a couple of minutes to
half-an-hour. I went inside and looked for the same code that I have looked for
a handful of times this past month.

When I got back to the metro, mistakenly I took the same way that I had come
from. I did not realize the error of my way until the robotic voice warned us
about a slowing before getting to the next station. Since I had positioned
myself close to the door, I could easily get off at Champ de mars to return to
the right way. The opposite train arrived as I was halfway through my way on
the opposite platform.

The wait for the bus at Sherbrooke was only 15 minutes. I managed to read the
first chapter inside the metro station as the countdown on the screen above
went closer and closer to  zero. I stepped outside and continued reading for
the last 3 minutes of wait. The man who had exited to wait at bus stop before
me looked at me, then at the book in my hands, and smiled. He started talking
but the music of my earphones made it impossible for me to understand. I took
the right bud and moved my head suggesting him to start over. He spoke too
quickly and too québécois for me to be sure what he said. It was a comment
about how it had been long since he had seen it. I was amazed that
a middle-aged men had made a comment about the queer feminist manifesto in my
hands, until I caught up with the possibility he was just talking about
referenced King Kong.

I arrived to the Neuro and walked into my office. By plugging in my work
computer I finished with the second of the three goals for my second half of
the weekend. I left my stuff and decided to use the two elevators to get to the
cafeteria. The way there was calm and solitary. The door of the cafeteria was
closed, making easy to see the opening hours and realizing that I had been an
hour too late.

Defeated, I took the first elevator back and entered the room in front with the
vending machines. I was outraged by the fact that a starbucks coffee beverage
was 6 CAD. My last hope was the vending machine in front of the second
elevator. It took me around 10 minutes figuring out how to use the app and
putting funds into it to buy a 2.5 CAD mediocre latte.

I worked until the sun set and there was no more use of the daylight savings
time.

I exited through the stadium. There was still a lot of ice on the park area
outside the gymnaseum. I slipped on the last stretch, scratching my knee and
bending my right leg. The pain is gone by now.

I stopped at metro to buy some groseries. Although I had only plan to buy
a salad and hummus, I ended up spending around 50 CAD on a bunch of other stuff
including plant-based deli meat and sausages.

After getting home, I prepared a cup of rice and heated the last of the bean
dish I had made earlier this week.

While I definitely should, I am unsure I will go to the lab tomorrow.

### Tuesday, March 11th, 2025

Y, ¿de qué sirve hablar? No te quiero ver.¿De qué sirve verte si no te puedo
tener aquí?Y verte así.

Nadie va a pensar en ti mejor que yo. Ed Maverick.  Was it a conscious decision
not to write yesterday or did I just decide not to do it?

Was it conscious, too, or was I forced to not attend the Neuro meeting?

Like the week before, I woke up and grabbed the phone waiting for an email,
a notice that there was—or preferably, not—the meeting that we had been
postponing or cancelling. There was something, but not what I was hoping. Louis
sent out a reminder to meet us that afternoon. It was a follow-up to Daniel's
original e-mail stating that the plans for that meeting would be to update
everyone on the status of our research and projects. I read it and felt the
heaviness of life pushing me down. It was much stronger than the motivation the
night before that had led me to put an alarm early to have plenty of time to
get to the office. I sent out a reply to all, letting them know that I was not
feeling well. Rather than depression, the cause I used was the half-truth of my
sore throat during the weekend. To them, I said that it had developed into
a full flu. I was going to stay home for the next few days, so I would try—big
emphasis on the lack of commitment—to connect on Teams.

Defeated, I went back to bed.

I had plenty of time to sleep a little more and get up to my desk to join the
meeting. I was not able.

Around 13h, I got another email. Or perhaps it was a direct message on Teams.
Louis wanted to let me know they were all ready and I could connect whenever
I wanted. I had barely the energy to text out an apology that I started feeling
much worse and would have to skip the meeting. Louis used an outlook feature
that I am unfamiliar with to react to whatever was it the medium I sent it on
with a thumbs up emoji. I am not sure how much I slept.

For some reason I do not feel like continuing writing about yesterday. It is
hard to even think about what was it that happened. I am sure it was an
uneventful day, yet there is still this nagging feeling that I am forgetting
something.

I could not fall asleep. Midnight came and went. I took the pill at an
appropriate hour. I masturbated thinking that would ease my nerves and calm me
down. By 2h and 3h, I was still turning fighting my own mind and body.
I decided to get up and continue working on whatever I was doing for the paper
I still have not finished correcting. I lasted around two hours, before I was
too tired to concentrate, albeit still not sleepy. I do not know how long it
turn me to finally fall asleep.

I might have put an alarm, but if I did, it was useless. After the Daylight
Saving Time, my therapy session was an hour later at noon. Even having that
extra hour, I got out of bed with only enough time to dampening my hair to tame
the curls and fake a fresh out of the shower look.

I think it was yesterday, when Sonny asked me how I was doing and I confessed
that not very well.

"Let her go," was the only thing she said; maybe the only thing there was to
say.

This morning I received a notification from my messaging app. It was Yuval, he
started by reminding me who he was, and continued letting me know that he would
need to come over sometime to give me the notice of lease renewal and a bottle
of champagne. He was going to be around the building cleaning the shared areas
so, if I were to come back, I could find him. I could have replied that I was
in and he could knock and come anytime. I was not about to leave until the
early evening. I had plenty of time; it would have been the best for both of
us. Why did I decide against it?

In my therapy I mentioned my mood swings. I referred back the Sunday before
last. I talkde how that same Tuesday when we had our last session, I met with
Majo and Emily. That evening after she left, Majo and I remained there and she
brought it up asking how normal those episodes were for me. She wondered how
concerned she should be about it happening again. Or even it happening at all.

I brought up how I have been more intentional about keeping track of my daily
life in the traveller's notebook. I mentioned the night I did not sleep at all
and the euphoria and energy I had the full day. I talked about Friday and how
Majo and I came back to my place to watch a movie, only to be interrupted by
that text that neither of us were expecting.

Did I talk too much about that message? Did I approach the subject in depth
about the confusion and mixture of emotions I felt after reading those
sentences? I for sure said nothing about the double space after the comma.
I most probably did not mention either that the same sentences have had several
different meanings depending on the day I reread them. I definitely did not say
that I deleted the whole conversation to keep it away from my mind, only to
recover them back from the almost-oblivion.

Fabiola asked me what was it that I wanted from Clara.

Did I mention the message that I was waiting to send back?

Clarity, was what I replied. A clear answer, was how I further explained it.

She brought up that, from what she remembers, last time we met Clara let me
know she was not ready nor wanted to have anything more serious, nothing more
committed, or even just consistent;  she openly stated that she would not be
able to even change her ways of communicating. Fabiola continued how, these two
weeks of silence and the further week of waiting before replying to my text are
further evidence of that I already knew.

"A mí me parece bastante claro."

Somewhen during the weekend Alda had reached out to me in the morning asking me
for my plans for the day. Later, when I was fully awake I replied back with
whatever was it that I was going to do. She continued that she had thought
about asking me to do something, but since then realized that it was her second
day of her period and thus would rather do it some other time. That other time
was this evening.

We had talked about coming here to Oui mais non. When we confirmed the idea of
a café, Alda worried that there would not be many options open that would be
open in the evening. I thought about velours and remember one date I had in the
late afternoon. She was blonde and we spoke French. She worked at Marché
Jean-Talon in a tea shop—was it hers? I brought up that Ouis mais non opens
until around 22h, so it would be perfect for meeting at around 18h.

In the morning I saw that the weather today was not only above 0°, but around
9°. It would be a missed opportunity to stay inside and not make use of it.
Rather than wearing my red puffy coat, I grabbed the black denim jacket that
I have not worn since last year. I took the laptop that Vlad gave me, the next
book that I need to finish and return to the library by the end of the month,
and headed out to the library. I worried a little that Yuval would see me and
intercept me on the way. He did not.

I did not stay long at the library by the time that Alda replied to my text
letting her know of my plans and giving her the option of meeting at La graine
brûlée. Instead, she proposed going somewhere to eat. Neither of us felt like
searching for new available options. After wondering a bit, we ended up
deciding to go to La Taverne Atlantic. It was the place of that terrasse that
her, Sonny, and I, ended up at after wandering through Little Italy. We had
forgotten its name and lost track of it, barely remember the terrasse and the
feeling of wanting to go back. Months ago, while I was looking for places,
I hunted for it. I forgot how, but I ended up finding it and saving it on my
maps.

We talked about doing something, perhaps, next Monday for St-Patrick's. Both
Alda and Majo seem to agree with the idea of meeting the three of us together
again.

I took the 480 bus with the plan of transferring to the 193 that leaves me one
or two blocks away of my house. It was still sunny outside by the time we left
the bar. Instead I decided to come to Ouis mais non by myself and write here.
The extra five dollars I would spend for this cup of tea seemed to be worthing
not being by myself for one or two more hours.

### Wednesday, March 12th, 2025

Hey Clara, I don't know what is going on, but I sincerely hope things are well
with you. I really wanted this to work, but this way of communicating has
gotten very hurtful and is no longer working for me. I am sorry. I wish you the
best. No need to text back.   The caption under the image of the text written
down in Notes rather as a draft in Messages says I am almost there.

I had decided to stop working and head to bed. I realized that I had not
written today and I turned the computer back on.

Yuval was supposed to come over today. I felt pressured in the morning to get
out of bed and be somewhat ready whenever I heard the knocking on my door.
I pushed back the alarm when I woke up at 9h. Perhaps I did stand up at 10h,
but probably did not do it until 11h.

I brewed my coffee and sat down on the computer. I decided not to shower. Noon
came and went. Neither Yuval nor hunger ever knocked on my door.

Miriam texted me early asking for my address. I replied almost immediately and
we confirmed our agreed time. I showered somewhen between 15h and 16h. My hair
was still damp by the time I went out to meet Miriam who arrived punctually.

Before I showered, one of the times I absentmindedly opened instagram, a green
halo over Clara's orange-tinted picture was the first one on the row of stories
to the left of al the people I no longer care about. A quiet but strong impulse
to click on it made my hand tremble. I held it off. I went to get ready
instead.

I was changed on my outdoor clothes when I lied down on my bed and consciously
saw the video. There was picture of a newspaper with Trump's face on it. On
top, half covering the headline in French. Salut je cherche des recommandations
pour BD/roman graphics (pas sombres, pas en série). Below, there was a box for
answers captioned with a preemptive Merci and a text heart like the one she
signed on the ticket that I stole from Lola Rosa.

I thought back to my own favourite graphic novels, probably trying to hunt down
a reason that I could use as an excuse to reach back. Most of the books I like
are dark. I could not think of a single one that could fill her criteria. Years
ago, when I met *, we went somewhere on Saint-Henri, or perhaps Verdun, for
brunch. She studied or taught English literaure, so I asked her for
a recommendation. She mentioned Fun Home, from the queer artist Alice Bechdel
famous for her eponymous movie test. I bought it and read it. I went to my
living room and looked for it, as if I considered sending a picture rather than
its name.

I sent nothing and left to the pastry place with Miriam.

We sat down and ate our desserts. We continued there the small-talk that had
started in her car after she picked me up. We talked about our job, my plans
for the future. Half-way through our friends' date, I brought up as a fun fact
how I have started being vegetarian. We talked about how that is going for me,
after I hopped around the details of how my motivation for that started. When
I mentioned going out with two people who were vegetarian or vegan, she asked
if one of them was the french one.

By the end, I did end up giving her a brief summary of how my 3-4 month
whatever had come to a practical end. Like Majo, she suggested me to end
things. She explained how, as a society, we have fallen to the trick of
self-censoring our emotions with therapy talk and the pretense of being
emotional intelligent.

"A veces un chinga tu madre, es bien merecido y hasta necesario."

Unlike María, close to the end of our conversation, she asked me if I was going
to text her, sincerely curious of my answer, aware that I would probably opt
for something else entirely.

When I sent the draft to Majo, she texted back an old poem we had talked about
before:

Orpheus and Eurydicus

Every day I send you an e-mail, in it I write  my news, every time I end with
a request: if

you're there and you're well,  don't write back.

### Thursday, March 13th, 2025

"Sometimes the thought of skipping my meds flirts  with me. It's mornings like
this, when I somehow do not need to sleep. The sun rises and I welcome it—still
tireless. I get up from my unused bed. It feels like nothing can go wrong now.
The world is safe. It's mine alone. I fear nothing. I can do anything. I don't
need anyone."  It happened again. This time, although the energy is  still here
now almost 36h of no sleeping, the euphoria vanished much much quicker.

I don't remember how it was—how it was started. Last week—was it just last
week?—it was after coming back from dinning with Majo after I was reluctant to
return to an empty house. I went to bed without realizing I had skipped a dose.
By the time I had realized it was already 3h and I feared that taking it so
late would make it impossible to get up early enough. I have narrated already
how my mood changed abruptly as the night came and left. Yesternight, I don't
believe it was like that.

I filled back my instagram, chose some of the pictures that I had, perhaps
forehandedly, securely saved away in the archive rather than delete them.
Changed my name and profile picture. Was that an incoscious way of making my
profile irrecognazible to careless viewers?

As I turned off the computer and reopened the closed windows Brave, there were
a couple tabs of the asofterworld webcomic.

I used to say I missed you after just a weekend, like a child learning to talk,
who calls every cat a tiger.

That was not the first one I sent Majo. I thought back to this comic after
I shared with her an old dream I had when I was a teenager.

"una vez sí soñé, que mi papá nos avisaba en la mesa, a la cena, que esa noche
iba a morir, que en unas horas tenía que salir por esa puerta y no volvería
nunca. Y yo me paraba y le rogaba que no se fuera."

We have had this conversation before. I cannot imagine grieving the death of my
parents. Last night I added how I only dream about my dog dying.

"Me desmorono y me caigo al piso. Se me van las fuerzas de las piernas y no
puedo dejar de llorar."

That is how I thought back to asofterworld. I remembered that old favourite of
mine:

I have this dream where my sister is taking my picture and I keep saying don't
go on the plane and she says say cheese.

I have lost count by now of the times that I have desperately sobbed today.

The first story I posted on instagram was short and precise.

Lista para irme. Y volví.

Two hours later, I posted another webcomic:

I meant to suicide but the warm water was your voice and I touched myself
instead.

Finally, two hours later, I posted the third and last one. This was reserved to
the only selected two dozen of people whom I did not mind knowing about my
diagnosis.

How aware was it of the underlying intention of having evidence that Clara is
still aware of my existence? Was I unconsciouly recreating the circumstances
last week that could have led her to reach back?

Majo seemed to think so. I had left my apartment before the sun rose. I was one
of the first people to arrive to the BIC. I texted her much earlier than when
we usually talk. I bluffed saying that I was considering blocking her. She
called it, as anyone who has gotten to know my by now would.

I worked by myself in calm silence for a couple of hours before Neda arrived
startling me. On the open instagram website I have in another window I just
checked that she had not seen my story a coupld of hours old by then. She was
not aware that I had not slept at all.

Alda reached out. She did see it—she was the only one who reacted to it.

No, that is not true. Misael reached out, too. He sent me a link to a song that
he was reminded of as he read it.

Alda asked me if I wanted to do something. I met with her after my meeting with
Louis. I think how the chaos was starting to unsettle inside of me as I walked
to Eaton. But as I write this now, I can picture it as well on my morning walk
to the metro.

At this exact moment, the clock marks my 36h of being awake. I will go to bed.

I will not take tonight's pill.

"Desperté con ganas del sabor del café de baristello  "Pero casi lo tenía en la
boca"

"por favor no me vuelvas a escribir/decir de venir"   I do not think I have
ever felt like this before. I have felt high with euphoria and full of energy;
intoxicated by sexual desire and blinded by irrational impulsivity, driven only
by whatever is it that I crave at the moment. I have felt weighted down by
voidness and dread, drained almost entirely of any motivation, energy, or will.
This, whatever this is that has been happening these last weeks is something
else entirely. I am overwhelmed by emotion, by a energy that pushes me from
within but drives me nowhere. Aimless impulses and chaos. Sleepless nights
where I draft messages that I do not want to send, where I think back of
half-remembered memories whose nostalgia is no longer just bitter but
poisonous. I get out of my barely used bed, leave my apartment without turning
off the lights to an even darker outside. The walk towards the metro is
lonesome, there is nobody to see the mixture of emotions that contort my face
into a painful frown. Every step over the damp sidewalks framed by the melting
ice, feels intentful and strong. Am I going somewhere or going aware from
something?

Why have these days I felt this strange need to be outside my house—my space
and my own thoughts? Why do I keep coming out to places like this one, noisy
cafés or full libraries where there are people around me—but not with me?

I told Miriam that being vegetarian had not come with any particular
difficulties. Not only had I not felt the need for meat, but I seemed to lack
any desire or craving for it. Is it just meat that I do not seem to want? That
day we met my only meal for the full day was the bread cone dessert filled with
peanut butter. Yesterday, while it was one of the only handful of times that
I have prepared lunch to take with me to the office, that pita sandwich was
only one of two barely meals for the full day.

Last night I felt the full weight of my lack of sleep. I let myself fall down
exhausted physically and emotionally into my undersized black couch, my legs
throbbing in pain and my lungs felt full of sand rather than air; every breath
hard, sharp and corrosive. Were the overdsaturated thoughts or the deafining
emotions that dragged me to unrestrained sobbing.

Just last hour, as I started writing on the first portion of this entry,
I cared little about the stream of tears that dampened my cheeks as I am
sitting here in the middle of anonymous strangers. I think back to when I was
little, every other person seemed bigger, intimidating. When I first
transitioned, everyone around me felt foreign by their normativity, their lack
of need of transgress anything, which resulted in a dissimilar but parallel
intimidation. When was it that I have outgrown both of these abstract borders
between me and others?

Most of the changes I have been experiencing these past few weeks related to my
hormones, other than the objective undeniable ones, must be psychosomatic. The
familiar yet old soreness and sensibility on my breasts, the thinner and barely
parceptible fairer skin on my skin, these uncontrollable and disorienting mood
swings.

I sent to Majo a screenshot of an article I found online titled Clinical
characteristics of women with reproductive cycle–associated bipolar disorder
symptoms.

"Sounds like me once a month"

"creo que he llorado mas esta semana que los ultimos 5 años"

"Yeap  "Ahora todo eso con bipolar disorder"Ya sin bipolar es difícil"

This morning, after I got out of bed finally around noon and interrupted my
breakfast cooking for a quick errand for coffee when I realized that I had only
7.5g of left, I asked her if she could text me whenever I could join her at the
RI. At first she replied affirmatively, almost absentmindedly. I cannot
remember if I had already showered. If it was after I had brewed my coffee,
then I must have changed since I had gone outside to the real world. She
reached back and told me how Shubbendrah had invited her to an indian religious
thing in the afternoon. I feared she was going to cancel on our meeting this
evening. Last night, when I thought about it, I considered the idea of asking
her to hug me, and fantasized how would it be to let myself cry out in the
company of a friend rather than hugged only by the dimmed two-out-of-three led
lamps in my empty apartment. She continued saying that she felt tired due to
PMSing. I finally dared to ask her if she wanted to postpone. She said no.

### Saturday, March 15th, 2025

"ayer soñé que mi perra hablaba, se veía más vieja y caminaba muy lento, venía
conmigo y se acostaba en el piso, la abrazaba y me decía, 'es hora. tienes que
dejarme ir.'  "y empezaba a llorar y le decía que no, hasta que empezaba
a gritar."   This might be one of the hardest times to write these daily words.
Not because anything has happened, but because of the struggle that it was to
be able to gather the energy necessary to push me up and come sit down.

Why do I keep crying? Where did I keep all of these tears inside my body? How
have my eyes not dried up by now—how come I have not yet dehydrated?

Two nights ago I opened up Hinge and there was a newborn match in there. The
picture I had chosen to like her profile was of her squatting on the floor of
her bedroom, wearing different unmatching pieces of clothing. In her bio
details, it said she was a writer. I made a comment about being up so late
during a school night and asked it that was a writer's schedule.

She replied back in a couple of minutes, continuing the conversation. I shared
how I had not slept for around 36h, and was having trouble getting back to
sleep. We talked a little about sleep depravation and writing. My last message
was asking about her writing.

The next day, at around 14h, when I opened up the application, her profile was
gone.

Yesterday, in the afternoon, Majo asked me if I wanted to meet her in the RI
after all. She had come back from Shu's religious event due to pending
unfinished report she had to send. I took the rest of the orange line and sat
in her office continuing reading the pink book.

We did not have dinner in the hospital this time. We went to buy cookies from
the place that I liked. We got two hot and chewy lemon kisses straight out of
the oven. The plan then was to go get falafel and coffee af café olympico. By
the time we got off the metro and were walking towards Falafel Yoni, I proposed
instead to take the 55 bus and have our coffee at Ouis mais non.

When we passed by the entrance of the café, Majo proposed instead to skip it
altogether and just come watch the movie. We passed by the depanneur, but they
did not have thai teas. I bought two cans of spiked lemonaded and iced tea.
I was nervous that she would dislike this sequel fond to me, just as she hated
the first one. I was curious, how much it would hit me this time that I have
been crying much much easily.

After the film ended, we continued watching music videos on YouTube until
around the time she had to leave to take the last metro of the green line to
get home.

I took my pill last night. After midnight I chose and edited some photographs
from two of the latest rolls of film I developed. I asked chatgpt to ranked
them and help me choose the one that I could post online. There were two
similar shots, black and white, from statues by the shore of the beach in my
hometown. Those were it favourites.

This morning I woke up warm, soaked in the moistness and stench of my sweat.
I had no energy to get off from under the covers.

Yuval texted me, apologizing for the text of yesterday that was actually not
adressed at me at all. He asked me if I would be home either today or tomorrow.
I pushed it to tomorrow depsite my staying in all day.

Eventually I did shower and even washed my two sets of sheets.

I had cooked food from yesterday's breakfast. I ordered pizza, not vegetarian.
I had a slice and  a half. By the last bites, the taste of the meat disgusted
me a little.

Around noon I posted a story with a small sondage, asking people to choose
their pick from the two B&W shots. I was surprised by some people actually
answering, including Max, from South Africa, Monica Garza, and Clara.

I posted a coloured photo from Xochimilco of a vendor holding up a blanket with
an axolotl. Not many people noticed or acknowledged it.

Clara herself posted two stories, one public and another restricted. She was
shooting somewhere in Ontario, surrounded by dogs. I remembered her mentioning
travelling somewhere for a shot of her brother's friend or boss. Later she
posted a set of scans from the half-frame camera she found in her attic back in
France. I click the like button on both her second story and the post, as if
I were signing my name in a visitor's log book.

I am not sure if it was before or after that—probably after, but yet again
I cannot recall how much after, I went to our conversation and deleted the
message in French recommending her the book.

### Sunday, March 16th, 2025

Can you come over? I want to hurt myself.   What is going on? Why am I hurting
this much?

I remained in bed well past noon. My phone was always at reach in case
I received a call or a text message. I drafted a text asking Yuval to let me
know a couple of minutes before his arrival in order to be ready to receive
him. I wrote somewhere in there that I was not feeling well and I remained in
bed. That first message was never sent. Later he did text that he would be
coming soon; he asked if I would be available to receive him. I lied saying
I was feeling a little sick and would remained in pjs, but I would stay home
all day. He was kind enough to give me a head start by anouncing his ETA of 15
minutes.

He knocked on my door. He came inside, just like Didier had done last year. He
did not made en effort, even subtly, to look around at the state of the place.
He gave me the notice to sign where it informs me that the rent will go up 55
CAD. It's a reasonable rent increase that makes my decision to leave or stay
even harder.

I went back to bed. It is impossible to know how many of those hours did I pass
asleep and how many I spent crying.

That is not entirely true. I heated another slice of pizza and half of the
fries that were left. Again, I felt disgusted by the taste of the meat. I might
throw away the last cold slice. I tried watching an episode of White Lotus.
I gave up around the second third.

I watched Clara's stories from last night doing the shooting at the pet place.
I took a screencapture of the second one on which she pets the dog and then
pans the camera towards her and you see her twitching her face in a contorted
smile. I thought I was the only one who had the habit of smiling downwards.

Sonny is waiting for me. Yesterday we were looking into the flights for her to
come. The most viable option is for her to fly the night of the Tamino concert.
She proposed staying until the end of May. I froze by the idea of it. Every
single time she has come and stayed with me, I have wished her stay were
longer. Every single day of her departure, when it finally arrives, I wish to
push it away further. Why now did I hesitated about it?

I told Majo about it yesterday. I said I had no idea about what it was, and
then shortly after I corrected myself. I did know, I was just aware of how
stupid the idea was.

"que con sonny aquí, no vería a clara, más que eso, no podría venir aquí"

María laughed at the idea. I asked her not to, and then confessed that it was
something that hurt me.

"Wey es que no tiene sentido  "O sea, si Clara regresa, se pueden ver en otro
lado  Aunque ya sabes que yo pienso que no va a regresar"

Last night we did not buy the tickets. I went to bed, and then at night Sonny
did. She asked me if today we could do it. I half-remember her saying something
about late afternoon or evening. It might have been around when I was eating,
before I returned to hide under the sheets.

Around 21h, I put on a pair of pants and a hoodie. I slipped my feet on my
boots and headed outside to the depanneur. I wanted to get something to drink.
I thought about a can of thai tea, but was well aware that I would end up
looking for something with alcohol. Fortunately I had forgotten all about the
bottle of champagne that is in my fridge.

I ended up getting a bottle of ginger beer and a can of extra strong beer.
I opened up the latter. It tastes like shit, but I kept drinking it.

I deleted all of the unseen messages in both Clara's and Paty's conversations.
I have no idea whether they would notice or not. There is a slight worry that
the former will see this gesture as a way of signaling I want nothing to do
with her anymore. Ironically, I thought about reaching out to the latter to
both inform her I was back on instagram, and that the silence from her was
hurtful.

I did not do it. I probably won't.

There is an unwrapped razor blade next to my half-drunk can of holland extra
beer.

Maybe, maybe I should ask Majo to come. I know she would. Maybe.

### Tuesday, March 18th, 2025

Last time I heard from her she said: Hey, miss you too. Rather than questioning
its truth, I noticed the two blank spaces. Were they just an extra touch born
of impatience? Or evidence of a removed pet name perhaps deemed too intimate?
Maybe it was the mark left after returning to intentionally drop the “I”—a
quiet self-extraction, a protection in impersonality. In any case, a subtle
deletion hinting at a part of us erased.  In that small pause, I imagined all
the things left unsaid—the overthinking that stifled a confession, the quiet
guilt of not daring to be fully honest.   Those were two spaces, but they were
not empty; they echoed with the possibility of something more, a vulnerability
that lingered in what was not said.   I have not felt well these past few
weeks. Today, I feel sick.

Most of my weekend I spent it in bed. Yesterday, I kept waking up and looking
to the phone, refreshing the inbox of my work email, parsing through the unread
messages and the work-related electronic leaflets and brochures that slip
through outlook's junk filter. I searched Louis' or Daniel's name. Eventually,
some time before noon, I found what I was looking for, a reminder that there
was no lab meeting this week. I turned down my phone next to my bed, and went
back to hide from reality.

I do not know at what time I got out of bed. I do not remember if I did any
work at all—my best guess is that I did not. I am sitting down on the black
couch with the lights dimmed, I just tried to put down the latest events into
my agenda. I wished I could have gone back to read yesterday's entry to remind
myself of what happened yesterday. Majo should arrive any minute now.

I cooked, maybe. I definitely reheated and had the last slice of pizza, and
confirmed for a third time, the off-putting new foul flavour of meat. I cried,
for sure. But how many times this day?

Should I write down that I am crying right now as I am finishing this
paragraph? Do I want to remember this?

I edited more pictures and wanted to post something on instagram. I craved that
artificial sense of companionship, of not-loneliness, that comes from saying
something and pretend that people see it and pay attention to it.

Yesterday, since when I confirmed I could self-extract myself out the day as
I read Louis—or perhaps Daniel's—email, I was aware that it was going to be an
uneventful day. The main events were going to be today, my session with
Fabiola, and tomorrow, the one with Dr. Franck.

I think it was Majo who related what has been happening—within me, outside
nothing at all has happened—with Clara to obsession. Has it crossed that line
by now? It is compulsive how I review the people who have seen my story looking
for her name. It is compulsive how I have imprinted in my work-memory the
finger movements I need to open her profile and check if I remain in the list
of exclusive people allowed to see her reserved images.

I thought about posting about her last message. Aggresively forcing her out of
her silence, by calling her out publicly, like I would have done three years
ago with Kate. Unlike that time, I felt disgusted by my own impulse and saved
the image to my own private library. Instead, I first posted asofterworld
comic.

I hate putting my desire into words when my body knows exactly what to say.
Come home.

That was not enough. The second one was the second or third picture in one of
the negatives she has. It is the picture I took of a rainbow parasol covering
the sunset in Zona Rosa as I was searching for Paty, mere moments before
finding her by the opposite corner of the street. At the bottom of the
photograph, in Spanish and as a footnote, I added: la última vez que nos
habíamos visto, nos tomamos de las manos, nos miramos fijo a los ojos, y no me
atreví a besarla.

I went to bed and neither Clara nor Paty had seen them. I ignore which of them
was whom I intended more consciously to see and notice it. Both of them appear
now in the list of expectators about to disappear by tomorrow. I have forgotten
by around what time they appear or who was first. After I saw them, the world
continued being exactly the same.  "Hasta yo me siento frustrada; no tengo el
número de ninguna de tus amigas, excepto el de Sonny. ¿Está bien si contacto
a Sonny?"

Therapists are obligated to keep clinical confidentiality of their patients,
unless a specific handful of exceptions regarding legality, abuse, or risk of
harm. I guess today I reached that point.

Like the weekend before it, I spent most of Monday in bed. Despite this,
I could not wake up with plenty of time in the morning before my session with
Fabiola. The last of the alarms I postponed was for 11h. I remained in bed
around 15 minutes afterwards before I finally got up and grabbed a tshirt and
pair of underwear to change after the shower.

I had not showered since Friday. The smell of my sheets is probably foul
despite me not being able to notice. I do not know if Majo will want to sleep
with me on the same bed. I should remember to offer to change the sheets. Last
thing I heard of her was almost two hours ago when she told me she would go to
hers before coming here.

"esta bien  "no me voy dormir"

I managed to put shampoo on my hair, maybe even start with the conditioner,
when I was ambushed by that familiar sense of malaise that I have learned to be
weary of in the shower. It has been so many years since the last time I was
visited by it, that I got cocky and let my guard down. I rested for a while on
the wall before continuing to rinse my hair under the warm water. Then I felt
it coming as I had the soap in my hand. I have a vague memory of being
half-aware of my own body, as if I were to see it from above, witnessing myself
as the victim. I was on the floor, under the water still, jerking my arm and my
leg. As I was half-aware of my body, I was also half-aware of my glitching
mind, caught itself in an unresponsive loop.

When I came back to myself, I could still perceive the rancid aroma from my
unwashed body. I did as best as I could, to push through my affected state to
lather and rinse myself. This time I was astute enough to pull down the level
to make the water ice cold and try to shock myself into full consciousness.

There was no towel hung on the door. I have not showered since the weekend that
I did laundry. Soaking wet and naked, I stepped outside to my room to grab it
from the hamper that still holds my very dried clothes. I went back to the
bathroom and sat down on the toilet, half-wrapped in the towel and still
dripping. I stayed there, trying to control my breathing, until my body
returned to a more familiar state of normalcy.

I managed to get out the bathroom with just enough time to brew a cup of coffee
and sit down to welcome Fabiola punctually to our session.

When she started our session by asking me how have I been doing, how could
I have done anything other than laugh as I answered her?

I texted Majo if everything was alright. She said she was on her way.

I told Fabiola that everything is bad. I have cried more this past week than
the last 4 years together. I told her of the second time in March that I have
not slept a single hour the whole night. How this time there was no
compensating euphoria, just an exaggeration of feelings and reactions. How this
time it did not come after a missed dose; I did everything right, everything
that I must do. I told her how I spent most of the weekend and the day before
in bed, and even how I was tempted to text Majo, that I kept thinking of
hurting myself. I had told her before, as I was walking back from meeting with
Alda the afternoon I did not slept, I had these repetitive intrusive thoughts
of filling a syringe with saline and inject myself over and over. Sunday these
had evolved, now I wanted to release the pressure of this whistling bottle of
emotions that I have in my chest by small and deep enough cuts between the
fading scars on my upper thighs. I unwrapped the razorblade but left it unused.
I decided not to wrap it again or throw it away. I wanted to keep it there, not
in case I wanted to use it, but as a reminder of how low I am falling. When
I got to my room, first I hesitated of taking the pill. Then, I thought about
taking two, or three, or four or five. I took just the one and I went to sleep.

Fabiola reached out to Sonny, as she asked.

I had talked with Majo before my session when I told her I had passed out and
this time I started thinking maybe it were convulsions rather than syncopes. An
hour after the session I told her how my therapist had asked me to reach out to
Sonny. She told me Sonny had asked her to be with me with my appointment
tomorrow morning. Then she confirmed the time. Finally, she asked me if she
could sleep at my house tonight.

The motivation that Fabiola shared with me was to have someone by my side when
I see a doctor, like when I talk tomorrow with the psychiatrist. She made it
sound as having someone on my side as support. It strangely feels as having
someone make sure that I do not miss a single bit of what has happened.

The texts from my mum and dad make me think that Sonny did not reach out just
to Majo.

### Thursday, March 20th, 2025

"Hello, Sofía. How have you been?"

"Not good, actually. I actually have a lot to talk about."  María came to my
house two nights ago and, since then, she has not left my side.

In the morning she was the first to wake up and get out of bed. She showered
first, I think. I must have gotten up to show her how to aim the shower head to
the wall in order to not inundate my tiny bathroom. I do not remember doing
that.

Dr Franck was as punctual as ever. I felt a sudden rush of adrenaline when the
iPad on the other end of the living room started beeping mere instants before
the small notification on the bottom right corner of my computer screen bleeped
with the Dr's face. Even after I answered the call, the iPad continued ringing,
I had to raise my finger to the waiting psychiatrist to head over there and
shut it off. I did not relax afterwards, and thus was pretty nervous when
I looked at the small legal pad where I had noted down the important things
that have happened and I ought to go over. I started my speech and explained to
him, in as much detail as I could, how I have not been well at all since the
beginning of the year.

He listened, at least more than I was expecting him to. He raised my dose, as
I had thought; he added a slow dose of clonazepam to my prescription to aid
with my sleeping, like I knew he might; he paused and proposed me to write the
paperwork for me to take a leave of absence from the program, for at least
a couple of months.

"I... I really do not want to do that," I objected. I talked about the thesis
seminar as my mind wandered further into the graduation, the postdoc, the
immigration process.

"Well, of course you would not want to. I still believe this is the best option
moving forward."

I imagined taking his advice. Buying a plane ticket and going to my parents
house, habitating that room that is no longer mine, surrounded by stuff that do
not recognize me anymore, covering myself from the cold in apathetic sheets
that have no memory of my smell. I would be warmly embraced by my family, and
enthusiastically welcomed by my dog.

What else is there in that city that halfly remembers my name? Who else would
be there to notice my return?

He sent out the new prescription and scheduled a follow-up meeting next
Wednesday at noon. I no longer can remember what else we did for the rest of
the morning. I must have showered and I think I brewed coffee and prepared
breakfast for the both of us.

Early I received the call from the pharmacy notifying me of them receiving
these updated medications. Majo proposed we would wait until they were ready to
go and pick them up. She asked me to call them back. I told her how I am signed
up to this service where I receive an sms informing me when they're ready to
pick up. I proposed to head out and in the evening I could come back to pick
them up and get some change of clothes. I must have, earlier, offered to sleep
with her at her place rather than mine.

We were on some station before Berri-UQAM when I got the text. We decided to
head back right then and push up that late part of my itinerary.

It is hard to remember what happened the rest of the day. I brought my
laptop—the X1 and not the X22 that Vlad gave me—to work on the poster and
slides which had to be uploaded before midnight tonight in Vienna. Why can
I not remember what or where did I work?

I remember being here when Houssain, Majo's labmate, came and I finally met
him. María moved some stuff around and I sat down on the leftmost desk by the
door. Some time in the evening, we said good-bye and left him here working.

I can recall us walking around in Verdun. We where somewhere else, though,
because I can also remember this sense of urgency about making it to the
pharmacy before the closing hours.

When I went to my Jean Coutu, before heading to the counter to ask for my new
meds, I sat down at the machine and took my blood pressure. It was high. Not
critically or urgently abnormal, but the ticket still labeled it as high. All
of the day before I had felt sickly, and that malaise had not yet subsided
entirely.

After saying good-bye to Houssain, we went to Thomson for an HBHL event that
Majo had to attend. I managed to register in time. They would give out food.
Nathan Sprang, the PI of Emily, Majo's argumentative friend whom I met again
recently on some table upstairs from that event was the keynote speaker. Before
I had told to Majo how I pettily abhorred anything related to HBHL. I had
applied a couple of times to their funding and been repetetively rejected.
Almost all of the people I know are fellows from their, albeit humble, grants.
I sat there and listened to people talk about their undersample and purposeless
projects. I felt irritated by hearing about using multivariate, aimless,
voxelwise analyses trying to find the correlated regions in the brains to grit,
the personsality trait related to perseverance and goal-related passion. I felt
annoyed when I saw the plots of a postdoc, presented spurious interaction
results that would definitely not survive correction for the multiple
regressions in a sample of fewer than 50 people. All of these people's projects
were deemed more usable than mine; they were deemed more fundable than me.

By the end we walked outside towards where the food was. They announced there
were wraps with chicken on the left and vegetarian ones on the right. The rest
of the stuff was also vegetarian. There were spring rolls, spanakopitas, and
the same old tray of desserts.

Earlier there, Shub was the first to join us. Then Jana came and was excited to
see us. By the time of the dinner, there was also a brazilian girl whom I had
never met and whose name was never given to me. I felt apathethic to the
advice-flavoured conversation related to her candidacy exam and her first
committee meeting.

Some of the organizers of the event or maybe someone from the staff, finally
interrupted the conversation to let us know they would be closing down the
lower floor of the club house. We took that as a sign to leave.

All of us headed to the nearest metro. Jana was surprised when I did not go her
way towards the orange line and instead headed with the rest to the group
towards Angrignon. She made no questions about it nor referred to the second
black duffel bag that I was carrying with me.

We did make it to Pharmaprix before it closed. I took my blood pressure
a second time. The values were now in the normal range. This small relief did
not bring me the calm that I was hoping it would. As a second stop before
Majo's, we went to IGA. Most of the racks were almost empty. There were signs
informing of closing's savings. The store would be dying by the end of the
week. Majo grieved the soon absence of her close supermarket for the rest of
the walk to her house.

I tried to work some more before sleeping, but did not advance much. I took my
new meds expecting to fall asleep much faster and easier. Instead, I was
frustrated and disappointed. I did end up sleeping some time after midnight
and, like expected, had much more trouble than usual to wake up and start the
day.

There was an email from Louis congratulating everyone for the Persian New
Year's and notifying us that he would be working from home and thus all of the
day's meetings would be online. I have been nervous all day not knowing what to
expect in ours. How would I start the subject? What would be his reaction?

Majo, as a host this morning, was the one who brewed the coffee and prepared
breakfast. I had no purpose of going to The Neuro anymore. Aliza had proposed
to meet at Thomson today, since she would be going to the Wellness Hub. I had
still a lot to do before being ready to upload the poster and the slides and
the deadline was threateningly close. I joined Majo to the RI again and ended
up rainchecking on Aliza again.

Louis' talk was as reasurring as it could be. He corrected how the leave of
absence in McGill was for a full-term only, but he himself, since he is the one
who pays me and not the university, has no problem with me taking one or two
months if that is what I need. He offered to talk to Edward or Sylvia, or help
me come up with alternative explanations if I do not want to disclose what is
really going on.

"I do not know how it is to hear this, but all this stress about this situation
is coming not from the university or me, but from within yourself."

I closed the meeting telling him I was still unsure and unconvinced. I proposed
to take these days to sleep on it and next week touch base again on how to move
forward.

Just as reading my blood pressure was back to normal levels last night, the
conclusion of this meeting did not give me the reassurance that anyone would
have expected it to.

### Friday, March 21st, 2025

"The difference between us is that you cannot separate agency and will from
leaving; for you, leaving is an action, planned, intentional; for me, it is
just the transition between being present and then absent."You relate more to
the person leaving and I to the one who stays."It all is that to you leaving is
an action while for me it is just an event."  This is the first time that I by
myself since Tuesday's evening. I am not sure how I am managing. A couple of
hours ago, as I got into my dark and lone apartment—for some reason, when
I left Wednesday, I decided to shut down the lights on my back as I left—I
realized I was not ready to be by myself with my own emotions and thoughts.

I placed down the small bag duffel and my backpack on the made up reception
table. I took off my boots and my light black jacket. Even in the dimmed
lights, although static, the dust bunnies seemed to my eyes to be running
around under the tables and desk. I broomed the fake wood floors before
emptying my improptu luggage and choosing the clothes that I would wear today.

In just the three hours that I stayed in my apartment, I felt uneasy and
impatient to head out and be surrounded by people, nevermined if they were
strangers. I exchanged laptops and chargers and headed outside again.

"Which would be worse, buying cigarettes or alcohol?"

"Both, Sofía."

I took Jarry St rather than the inner streets of the neighborhood. I got inside
the larger depanneur and looked behind the cashier to see if there were
cigarettes on display. There were not and thus I bought nothing.

I did not give up the impulse and passed by the metro entrances another block.
I got inside the tabagerie. A group of teenagers were shuffling suspiciously
behind one of the counters conveniently out of sight of the apathetic cashier.
If he did not care, I had no reason to do myself. I wandered around, probably
just as suspicious, looking at the stuff that was inside. Here, as well, there
were no on display boxes from which I could get an idea of what flavour of
self-destruction I was craving.

"Bonne journée," I told him casually as I left the store empty handed and
disappointed.

Last night, leaving María's office, we took the metro. In the group with my
parents that I made again, the last message from our latest exchange was my
father's. "Y hoy te quedarás con Majo o regresas a tu depa?"

I did not reply to him because I did not know the answer myself. Earlier I had
briefly touched the subject with Sonny, telling her that I did not feel ready
to be by myself, but I was also worried of Majo getting sick of my company.

Fortunately, both the connection to her green line and my station were on the
same direction. I pushed the decision until the very last moment. The humanless
voice announced the stop at Lionel-groulx and Majo stood up. She looked at me
and asked me what I was going to do. I remained silent and seated, holding
tightly the black strap of my duffel bag. The doors opened. I do not remember
if it was before or after Majo turned towards the exit that I stood resignated
and walked behind her.

We got off at De l'eglise. There were wooden stands with different kinds of
food options. It must have been an event either for the season of les cabannes
à sucre or the anniversary of Verdun. We went to Majo's place to leave our
stuff and returned to explore around.

We found nothing of interest. As the night fell more unto the streets, the
vendors started cleaning and closing. Most of the stores and restaurants had
closed as well. I started feeling hungry and remembered how Majo does not
really have dinner. I wondered about the available options.

"You know another reason why I could not move to Verdun? There are no A&Ws
nearby. Where am I going to get a vegetarian burger at 2-3h?"

Rather than go to Uniburger, the closer albeit more expensive alternative, we
went inside an indian restaurant. I got vegetarian biryani and her chana
masala. We both closed the night with chai.

This morning I woke up before Majo and took my iPad to her living room to
connect to the useless talk I registered myself about the latest changes of the
available tracks to permanent residence in Québéc.

Majo brewed coffee and prepared breakfast. We continued our debate about the
necessary of agency in the act of leaving. I posted two stories this morning on
instagram. The first one was the overly casual and funny response from ChatGPT
from my question related to another argument we had about tofu being considered
cheese or not. The second was a poll about our original argument regarding
death being considered an act of leaving.

Not more than five minutes ago, I grabbed my phone and checked if Clara had by
now seen the second story she had not. She did but, unlike the previous poll
I did about my two pictures, gave no response.

### Saturday, March 22nd, 2025

"your magnet keeps falling off my fridge; feels like a bad omenanyway j'espère
que tu vas bien"   It was not even midnight yet when I texted Sonny.

"i should be stronger"by now"idk why i'm so weak"ya estoy mareada "i tried,
i really did"i did everything wrong"

She did not see them until this afternoon. By then I had already gotten out of
bed and maybe even drunk my coffee. After María asked me to postpone the movie,
we did not continue talking. Why did I not reach out to her? Was I scared of
pushing her to come over?

The memories of yesterday are spotty. I finished writing in the library, but
working on my projects was too hard. I took my book out from the backpack.
I read a couple of chapters, but even that required a lot of effort. The idea
of leaving was screaming inside me, every time louder than the one before.

But I did not want to come home.

I put my stuff away and headed towards the exit to the metro. I rode the orange
line just a couple of stations until Laurier. The idea was to walk to Dieu du
ciel!, find a table and get myself a bowl of fries and a glass of their
strongest beer. Or two; two would be more than enough.

I got outside by the exit that was the furthest away from my destination. I did
not walk fast, I had no hurry. I approached the bar and noticed a group of
people outside, chatting and smoking. Through the windows I noticed the crowd,
but it did not register fully until I opened the door and saw the tumultous
group standing by the sign that pleaded to wait for someone to seat us.

I turned on my heels and headed back outside. I walked back through the more
familiar Laurier street this time.

It was around 17h and the last thing I had eaten was the scrambled eggs that
Majo had prepared for me before noon. I considered stopping by Chez Claudette.
Except it was not hunger the impulse that what was driving me.

I got inside the humble groseries store a couple of blocks ahead from the
restaurant. I wandered around not sure what was it that I was looking for.
I wanted something drink, but not necessarily alcoholic—not yet. I chose
a carton of chocolate-flavoured almond milk. Then I exchanged it with a less
sugary version. By then I had foreseen that I would probably end up drinking
the full liter of it. I looked around the ready-to-eat food options. I grabbed
a 4.99CAD egg-salad sandwiches. The cheerines of the cashier for some reason
filled me with guilt. What would she think were she to know I intended to hurt
myself that night? Would she stop smiling? Would she have pleaded me not to?

I ate the two small meals before I made it to the metro. The ride back home
fell short, too short; just like when you are not eager to arrive.

I got off Jarry and crossed the street towards SAQ. I knew precisely what
I want it and where it would be. My movements were surgical and precise. The
cashier, young this time, was just as smily and cheerful as the previous one.
This time I just faked a smile and tried not to think of it.

It was hard to control the urge to open the bottle and take a sip of the
cinnamony whisky on my way home. I managed not to do it, despite walking
without any rush, without any desire to get there.

I took off almost everything that was heavying my body. My mind remained
overloaded. I opened the small orange bottle and took the first sweet sip. It
did not help.

The night continued outside the apartment. I filled one of the tall glasses
with ice, a much larger quantity of whisky than I should have, and chocolate
milk. I drank from it and welcomed the taste of alcohol. I sat down on the
corner of my black couch. I do not know if I put a series that I did not watch,
or music videos that I did not listen.

The Rouen magnet fell off again behind me, making a thunderous announcement.
I went to pick it up, but rather than reposition it, I just placed it atop the
fridge.

I texted Clara precisely at 20h. I deleted it permanently from my phone after
taking a screencapture that I could go back and read in case I forgot about it.
She has not replied, of course.

Moments later, I went into Paty's conversation and told her that her silence
has been hurtful. She has still not openly read it.

I went to sophie's private instagram and clicked on the button for requesting
access to it. Instantaneously after, I threw the phone away as if it had became
scorching red. This morning, I went into the recent searches and felt a mixture
of embarrasment and relief when her name still appeared, meaning she had not
blocked me. The first time I did not want to go further and know more. Moments
later I did enter and saw the suivre button sent back to its original state by
a rejection.

I took my meds last night despite having finished the complete bottle of
whisky. This morning I might have been a bit disappointed when I did wake up
with no consequences.

### Sunday, March 23rd, 2025

"That is exactly where she wants you to be—somewhere between remembered and
forgotten.

"And you certainly don't want to be another follower in her digital graveyard
of almosts and once-weres."  Aliza is supposed to arrive any moment now. If it
had been for me I would have cancelled yet another time. She texted me early in
the morning a quarter before 10h. Her message was a mixture of confirmation and
proposal of ideas. Last night, Majo told me I could ask her to do something low
pressure, like just sitting next to each other to watch something on television
or each read a book. She must have thought similarly. Somehow I was awake and
I responded affirmatively. I told her that I would prefer something in the late
afternoon or early evening. By then, I was well aware that neither my body nor
my mind were ready to start the day. Not even the craving of freshly brewed
coffee was enough to bring me back to life.

María and I watched the third movie of the Before series. I had warned her that
it was my least favourite. She insisted, despite not particularly liking the
first one, that once started the only thing left was to finish the three of
them.

She had now a spare key to let herself in my apartment. Still, there was a text
in my phone letting me know she was outside. I took off my red and black
blanket and headed towards the door. As I opened it I saw her waiting for me in
the lobby. Then, one of my neighbors upstairs entered my field of view as she
marched down the stairs. Suddenly, I was aware I was not wearing any pants.
I closed the door in front of me heading to the pile of clothes laying down the
floor of my bedroom. I grabbed and put on a pair of shorts to go welcome María.

I showed her how to work the lock. The particular dance necessary with the key
to convince the door to let you in. A secret handshake that has become second
nature for myself.

Aliza just texted me that she is at Jarry and will be joining me soon. Am
I intending to finish these before her arrival in around 10 minutes? She
offered that we could just sit down and do nothing, talk about nothing. Why
does writing my thoughts and feelings next to her feels different than telling
them to her outloud?

Both María and I kept looking at our phones as 40-year-olds Julie and Ethan
were arguing in Greece. I do not know if she wanted to leave. The thought about
her feeling sick of my company after all this time together was hard to
dismiss. All morning I felt hesitant to ask her if she still wanted to do the
movie plans she had postponed the day before due to her period—or was it her
headache?

The last three times she has come to watch a movie, she has stayed until the
very last moment that would allow her to take the last metro back home. At
10h30, she shared outloud that she had planned to leave at precisely that time,
but she would leave at 11h.

The last time I stood up from the couch to go to the toilette, I discreetly
went to my desktop and grabbed the unwrapped razorblade from the night before.
I took it with me to the restroom. After I peed and washed my hands, I put it
inside the opened packet and then put that into the larger box that still holds
around 45 more. I joined Majo and softly asked her to take them with her. I do
not remember if she made any comment other than nod and put the potentially
dangerous box into her bag.

By midnight I was again alone with my own company, surrounded by quiet but
overbearing thoughts and hollow and elusive emotions.

Aliza just arrived.

I’ve written before about compulsively opening instagram and going into Clara’s
profile to see whether I was still allowed to see her close-friend’s restricted
stories. This time I opened up the conversations window and scrolled down
looking for the orange-tinted picture. In its place there was grey silhouette
next to her name. Something dropped inside my chest. I put my finger on it to
open the almost 24h old story I had seen of her and whom I assumed was
a workmate posing with vegetarian hot-dogs. In its place there was a cold
robotic sentence informing me the story was no longer available. I went further
in and opened her profile. It was as if I had entered a recently evacuated
house: no furniture, no decorations, almost no signs of everyone ever living
there except subtle remnants that snitched a recent evacuation.

“No,” I softly exclaimed to the night, begging as if there were anything that
could be done.

After weeks, months, of doubt and uncertain grieving I had my answer. She had
blocked me. She had read my text, my once again attempt to reach out to her,
reminding her of myself, of us, and what she was doing to me in not
acknowledging it. And she had decided to finally, directly and effectively,
shut me out of her life. She closed the door in my face.

In the mixture of emotions that I was experiencing, I recognized the pain, but
I could not find the closure or relief that I was expecting from having
a response.

For 15 minutes I searched for them, until I realized that it was not just me
who was kept out, but rather the whole world. She had deactivated her account.

20 minutes ago, I did the same thing.

### Monday, March 24th, 2025

"hi Sofia, How goes? do you need anything from me?-Louis"

I had to pause the writing and lie down on the floor. My left breast screamed
in pain, probably for the recently appropriate dose of estrogen that I have
been lacking through neglectful care. I was blind and uncommunicated. No way
for reaching out. I could not see a couple inches away from my nose. Two times,
for two different reasons, I threw away first my glasses and then my phone.
I did not care about the idea of any of them breaking. Any of those would have
caused significant issues in my life.

I got both back. It was just a temper-tantrum of an immaturely emotional state
of being.

I can see now. I can reach out and answer back to all the messages that
I purposefully ignored. Clara has ignored me for around a month now, why
couldn't I just take one day off from the people that care of me as much as
I cared for her?

I do not even remember if I tried or not to set up an alarm to get up and go to
the Neuro meeting this afternoon. I cannot remember how hard it was to fall
asleep. I have all of my pills for the next couple of days spread out on my
night table. My bedroom is tinted of chaos. My dirty clothes spread out on the
floor echoing my psychiatric meds.

I made no effort to get in. There was an email—which I saw—that notified of the
lab meeting to talk about Neda and someone else's projects advances. I decided
to remain in bed. As if I could pause life from moving on.

Although it would be easy to check, I do not know at what time Louis reached
out specifically to me, asking me how he could aid me. This meeting would be
the second thing that I have missed. In three years since I have been
diagnosed, I have managed to keep my personal afflictions separate from my work
responsabilities. I do not know what is it about this time that it is so much
more difficult.

I have been fine. For decades I dealt with numerous issues without anyone
noticing. I was best of everything, I successed on anything that I put my hands
on despite the hell that I had to overcome. Why is it so much different this
time?

This is not the first stranger woman that I have developed unwarranted feelings
for. Why am I now on such a notably clinically nosedive into a crisis?

I could check, but I do not want to. I will just resignate to say that I do not
know at what time I replied to Lous email, confessionally sharing that these
past few days have been rough. I acknowledged that I would reach out to him to
talk about, whatever it is that is going on right now after I meet with my
psychiatrist in a couple of days. He did not answert, but there was nothing
left for him to say.

In this early afternoon, everyone has reached out. I have purposefully ignored
the group chats. I dismissed the messages from Sonny and Majo separately. The
first one casually asked how I was doing, and then followed up herself by
sharing that Aliza, whom I saw yesterday at the café, had mentioned she had
seen me alright. The former one tried again calling me several times. I assumed
it was their last try before reaching out to the rest of the network,
triggering the contingency plan of Aliza or Majo coming over to see I have not
tried to kill myself.

Would I? Be capable of putting an end to this? I think my fear of ceasing to
exist and think is uncountably larger than my will to end things.

I did not get out of bed before 14h. I had no will nor purpose to get up.
I thought about coming to my desk and continuing working. There is the deadline
to return the book that I have not finished to the library, together with the
fees of a late return. No matter the cost, it was not enought to make me pick
up the book and continuing reading.

I knew I had still half of a tupperware left of rice and beans I could mix with
one or two eggs and fried plant-based sausages. But I felt no hunger. I felt no
craving to fulfill my body for its own survival needs.

As the number of conversations that I kept ignoring rose, I decided to get up
and put on pants. I headed out of my dimmed apartment and headed first to the
SAQ where I bought a bottle of alcohol and then to la fruiterie where I got
some of the ingredients needed to make another vegetarian dish that would be
enought for me to feed on for another week.

There was an offer on DoorDash to get myself a significant discount on
a falafel pita with fries. It was hard to justify the extra spending after
buying the groceries. In the end, rather than ordering comfort takeout or
gathering the will to cook a new plate or even just reheating the food that is
already ready and will probably spoil soon, I just filled, more than warranted
, a glass of vodka and chocolate soy milk. I threw away first my glasses and
then my phone. I am not sure, but it feels right, that I refilled half- blind
my tall glass with the second third of vodka that I bought with the iced lemon
tea that María brought a couple of days ago. It is not finished yet. I do not
think it will be the last one.

I look inside myself, but I cannot find any will to reach out asking for help.
I know I will survive the night. Even if I dare to take both quetiapine and
clonazepam doses for the next two nights, I know they won't be lethal. I do not
want anyone to come check up on me. I will survive. Sometimes, I feel like it
is necessary for me to feel all of this pain by myself.

### Tuesday, March 25th, 2025

"No; what did I do? Fuck. FUCK!"  The number of unopened messages in my phone
keeps rising. Why am I doing this? My mum, Fabiola, Alda, Sonny. Reza. Myriam.

I was going to write unread, but that is not entirely true. I have read the
messages. I know what most of them say, their intention, their purpose. What is
it that is driving me to do to the people that love and care of me precisely
what has been done to me and hurt me.

What else is there to narrate about last night? It is in there how I decided,
again, to over-drink. Did I tell anyone this time? Could it be counted as
a not-so-subtle cry for help?

I definitely did not tell anyone—did I even write it?—how I went into my shower
and took off the—forgotten or purposely ignored?—razorblade inside my pink
double-edge safety shaving razor. I brought it with me to the desk. I even grab
a small antiseptic alcohol wipe and gentle glided it, almost as a caress, over
the differently-faded scars of other times I have hit rock bottom.

I did not cut myself. I did not finish the bottle. I half-remember getting
outside my bedroom in the morning and noticing still some watered-down
makeshift spiked chocolate milk. No, the second time I filled my glass I used
lemon iced-tea. Did I throw it away on the kitchen sink? Did I drink it before
brewing my coffee? Is my mind making all this up?

After midnight I decided to order two vegetarian burgers. I received them after
1h. I ate both of them as I did not pay attention to the first episode of
Severance. I cannot remember if I was still drinking by then. I cannot remember
either how much before I took my pills—the correct dose.

Just like Friday, there were no significant consequences of my impulsive
self-destructive behaviour. I did not puke; I had no hangover whatsoever; no
pains nor black-outs—just this hollow felling of shame and regret, the
realization that I am validating the reasoning behind the creation of a  secret
group-chat behind my back titled Now what? born to exchange notes about my
mental (not-) well-being.

I had an alarm set at 10h30. I set it with the intention of showering before my
session with Fabiola at noon. Like many other weeks before, I cancelled it and
pushed it until the very last minute. I got out of bed 15 minutes before our
appointment. I did not even wet nor tamed my curls. I put on an oversized red
long-sleeved t-shirt over the black tank-top I slept in. I used the little time
I had to brew myself coffee for the first time in almost a full week.

I told Fabiola how right after our last session I was not left on my own for
half of the week. I narrated to her the moment in the metro after María had
asked me what I wanted to do and I could not dare answer; how I remained
seated, paralyzed, both mentally and physically, until the very last moment
before the doors closed behind me and I rejoined María for the last time
I would be spending at her house.

I hesitated but ended up telling her both about the night of drinking before,
and the one that shortly preceded it the very first night that I was left alone
on my own devices. Why did I not talk about my difficulty with asking for help?
With receiving it.

There is something unnamed in me that keeps me from opening the conversation
with Majo and look up the message I half-remember on which I confess to her how
I am afraid that she is going to leave me too.

I remember months ago, walking on one of the many streets framed by Montreal's
characteristic duplex buildings, how she told me she feels pressured when she
is over-aware the moment she realizes she has become indispensable; when she
feels weighed down by the chains that trap her in an unescapable relationship.
Perhaps it is that thought that kept me from asking her to stay, to not go, the
Saturday she came to watch the last movie.

I do not remember if it was yesterday or some other time during the weekend
when I reached out to Myriam, asking her if she was back from Chicago. I had
forgotten all about until this morning right before I was about to shower and
my phone vibrated with her reaching back. Did Clara feel something like this
when she last replied to my i miss you plead, and I continued the conversation?
Was this same sense of dread and regret of pushing forward a relationship that
we are well aware will not lead to anywhere. Am I potentially playing with
Myriam's attention just as Clara did with mine?

A couple of hours ago Reza reached out. My absence is being noted by the rest
of the lab besides Louis. We missed you here, is everything alright? Neda and
Mohammedreza perhaps noted how I had deactivated instagram, once again yet this
time unannounced. Have they shared notes parallelly to the Now what? group
baptized by Aliza?

Did you get better? , his message ends.

Or am I getting worse?

### Thursday, March 27th, 2025

"You know how in the movies or television in psychiatric hospitals they always
show their patients all calmed down and drowsy from their meds, like just
sitting around colouring and drooling. Yeah, it's for a reason."  Yesterday
I had my appointment with Dr Franck. It was not early, like usual. I had plenty
of time to remain in bed. I cannot remember if I did. I have the memory of
cooking breakfast. I think it was of today instead, I cut some tomatoes and red
onion with some jalapeño. I had only one tortilla left. What happened then the
first half of yesterday?

The psychiatrist was as punctual as always. I was sitting down on my
computer—working? What else would I have been doing? This meeting did not have
to be as long and thorough as the previous one with María by my side. I was
just honest. I have not been feeling better; but I was not being worse either.
That was not enough for him. The clonazepam was not really working, it did not
help me falling asleep and just made it harder to get up in the morning. With
that extra bit of data, he had heard enough for a clinical conclusion. He
increased yet again the seroquel to 400mg. I am now taking double what I was by
the beginning of the month. He concluded outloud, perhaps only to himself, how
clonazepam is not that effective for sleeping. He asked me about Dayvigo.
I recognized the medication but I honestly could not remember how effective it
was. He prescribed me something different. I have read the name multiple times
but not cared enough for recalling it.

The rest of the day was uneventful.

Was that why I decided not to write?

I did not wait for the pharmacist to call me. In the early afternoon I dialed
up and, for some reason, pressed the number for services in French. I followed
up the instructions to reach the counter of the pharmacist. I asked about my
doctor having sent a prescription. The woman on the other end asked me for my
date of birth. After I mixed up and mentioned the month first like in English,
she corrected herself and asked for my phone number. When I gave him the
correct information, she told me she had not received anything from my doctor.
She asked me something that I quite not understood. I apologized and confessed
my insufficient mastery of the language. She apologized and corrected herself
again saying they indeed had received the new prescription. She confirmed with
me that I wanted them to prepare it for me and asked me if passing in three
hours would work for me. I answered affirmatively and we ended the call.

I did not shower and just grabbed a blue long-sleeved t-shirt and brown pair of
pants from the pile of dirty clothes that is growing on the floor of my bedroom
like moss. Both I have worn before. I did not care enough to check if they
smelled before I put them on.

I honestly do not remember, but I probably cried either walking to the pharmacy
or coming back. It was on the way back that I stopped at Tsikinis to get myself
a carton of oat milk. This time I did not think about stopping at SAQ. Just now
am I remembering about the almost empty of vodka that remains in my freezer.
I cannot say why exactly I am not tempted by the idea of finishing it.

When was it that I cooked the lentils? It must have been a couple of days ago.

I answered back to Reza's text. That was not today so it must have been
yesterday. I cannot remember what I said nor if he replied back.

Myriam has kept texting since replying to my message reaching out after her
trip to Chicago. She brought up the idea of asking me out that same day
mentioning she had been free. I did like often Clara would and said that the
idea sounded nice, but unfortunately it would not work out. She has not brought
the idea back again. My replying, while not reaching days-long retardation, has
been particularly late.

I remembered about Sarah and how the two weeks of her trip to South Korea must
have ended by now. I texted her something more than a week away that remained
unacknowledged. I considered the idea that she has gotten enough of me, but
when I went back to her conversation, I read how she mentioned seeing me after
her return in the same message she informed me about her upcoming departure. Do
I wanna see her?

Early last night I gave up on the day and took the pills eager to find out
their efficacy for kicking me out. They worked marvelously. Like the pharmacist
informed me—in a French-accented English after confirming with me that it would
work better for me—I started feeling its effects after maybe a half-an-hour.
I thought about last night when I decided not to take them before finishing
these words.

I did pause and stood up for a drink. Chocolate almond milk rather than vodka.

It is weird having these mixed feelings of sickly melancholy with the bright
sprouts of moody improvement. I think about going back to try to fix the
half-35. I think of the idea of going back to this journal and give it another
go to the idea of building a novel out of these snapshots. But then it comes
back, the clinical darkness and void. What is the point of fixing a camera if
I have nowhere to share the pictures? Why would I write about these anonymous
women who after meeting me decided I was not enough if not even them cared
about me? What makes me think my thoughts and emotions could interest anyone
other than my future self?

Alda shared with me her brother in law's Crave password. I am now sitting down
not-watching The Leftovers. I remember watching it once and concluding it was
one of my favourite television series.

Why now, more than ever when I feel like my life lacks value and worth do
I feel the urge to share its details with other people?

I did eat breakfast today, but it was not before my meeting with Louis. Going
to bed early made it easier to wake up just as early. In the morning I smelled
myself again. I must have not showered in the past few days. Like the abandoned
clothes, I have not washed my sheets since Majo slept with me the past week.
Tomorrow, if I do end up leaving the house, I should pass by an ATM and get
some cash to start hunting for more 1-dollar laundry coins.

I have to finish soon the other Despentes book. Did I write about going to the
library and finishing the other book there? If that is the case, did I mention
not helping looking into the the faces of the people studying with the hopes of
finding a familiar one?

Whenever I did, that must have been the last day I showered before today.

I did not have breakfast in the morning, but I did brew coffee. I sat down in
the computer and got to work. One or two hours before, shortly after 8h,
I replied to one of the several emails from Louis checking in on me. I thanked
him for his show of care and asked him to meet normally. By then I was
undecided still if I wanted to go to the office or stay at home. I told him so,
bringing up that I would then maybe need to meet on Teams. Shortly after he
replied that there was no problem about it.

I managed to finish some tables and figures to show him. He seemed surprised
and amazed that despite this arduous week, I managed to get some work done. We
talked about the plan of postponing the thesis seminar. We settled on a new
deadline for it. While the first half of the IPN website says I have to inform
IPN two weeks before its date, further down with the link of the poster I have
to fill the lapse increases to three weeks. Thus, we agreed on deciding next
Tuesday.

I asked him whether, if we do postpone it to late May, I would have enough time
to defend before the expiral of my study permit in November. He seemed relaxed
by the idea and said that I had plenty of time. Then, I said nothing when he
said he would reach out this week to the members of my committee for
a tentative date in May.

Sometime today  I received a message in Telegram like the numerous ones I get
offering me jobs or trying to recruit me for something except this one was in
Spanish. The name of the contact said Pedro Picapiedra. I asked whether I knew
him. It turned out to be Walter. Someone must have mentioned to him my
annoyance with being invited by third-parties, since he wanted to tell me about
breakfast at his place this coming Saturday. I did not RSVP.

In the group chat with María and Aliza, the former asked us whether we wanted
to go. The latter said she was excited. In our own chat, I told Majo I was
unsure about it. I gave her the same reason that I used myself for not going to
the office today.

I do not like people seeing me like this.

### Friday, March 28th, 2025

"can u let me know when i can join u, im feeling abit overwhelmed by my
thoughts"  I cannot remember if I have sit before on this precise spot. It
feels like it, but most probably it is not true. This time I have not cried.
I must have been here around three or four hours. I cannot tell if that is
above or below my usual.

Unlike yesterday, it was harder to fall asleep as it was to get out of bed in
the morning. I remember turning around and trying to masturbate in order to
ease my sleep. One of the signs that the hormones are working, besides the lack
of cleanup needed when I climax, is how much harder it actually is to get to
that point.

I was about to write how last night I shared with Majo my doubts about how much
to inject myself this morning given the mixed results I have gotten. My breasts
are no longer sore; the mood swings, while still present, are much less
overwhelming; I half-remember the sensation of semi-erections in the middle of
the night. It was not last night, though. I sent those messages at around 9h.
I did not fully wake-up nor get up until a couple of hours later. I think
I showered before injecting the same dose as last week.

Spring is coming. I has techincally arrived yet. Still, rather than my black
light jacket, I wore the red puffy one. I need to clean up the pile of dirty
clothes. With the new sleeping medication the new-side effect of sweating
through the night has made much more necessary that I wash the sheets which
I have not changed. I need to get some cash in order to hunt more laundry
coins.

I grabbed my old (newer) laptop, the thermos of coffee that I brewed, my
already-filled traveller's notebook and my iPad to come work at the library.
For some reason I have been feeling more at ease sitting among strangers than
with my labmates—whom I know now care about me enough to note my absence. In
yesterday's meeting with Louis, I mentioned working mostly from home. He had no
arguments against it.

He did ask me to frequently give out signs of life. He made an off-hand comment
about send of the cavalry were he to stop hearing about me. I was riding the
metro today and thought about giving him an emergency contact. He must have
access to the one registered in Minerva. Who is it?

Alda reached out some time today. She started by asking what had happened
regarding the picture I sent her a couple of days ago about the empty profile
of Clara. She continued by saying how she had thought I had not replied to her
and was just about the check up on me.

"Any progress in forgetting about her?"

I avoided her question. I did not say a word about having a tab in my phone
with the link to her profile, which I religiously go back to and check if it is
still empty. Next to it its mine, which I also check as if somehow it were to
come back to life by itself. I did not talk at all about how I often reopen the
same image she quoted trying to put myself back to those 15 minutes in which
I had definite closure. That hollow pain seems more comfortable than this
aimless waiting.

I have lost count—because for a while I did count them—of the days since I last
saw her or heard from her. I keep thinking about the subsequent lasts—the last
good date, the last unreciprocated kiss, the last text she sent, the last text
I sent—as if their significance could convince me of stop caring about this.

In less than two weeks is the concert that we planned months ago. Last time we
saw each other I confessed how I panicked by the thought of it. I do not think
she ever got that I feared of exactly what is happening right now.

Will I reach out to her yet again using it as an excuse? Will I look up for her
as I swim the crowds between songs or will I stay motionless with my sight
fixed on the scenery with the intention of erasing everyone around me and her
among them?

Will I even go?

I hesitated but sent to Majo a text asking her to let me know when I could join
her. She replied maybe a half-an-hour afterwards saying she would.

I did end up crying today at the library.

### Saturday, March 29th, 2025

"i have a hundred questions. i'm free this weekend if you're free/down"
I texted Majo to ignore my request and that I would be going home. I left the
library feeling chaos inside me.

Rather than take the orange line back home, I took the green line in the
opposite direction. I got off at Place des arts and walked towards Complexe
Desjardins. I wanted to drink. I wanted to quiet down the screaming thoughts in
my head and lighten the dense knot in my chest. I had to find my way through
the walled up usual route. I felt agitated, my breathing was rushed. I probably
looked distraught to the people around me. I did not feel their judgemental
sights. Not this time.

I bought a small bottle of whisky and then went inside the supermarket for
something quick to eat and have in my stomach besides the pudding cake piece of
the morning. I walked through the ready-to-eat section and looked at the
sandwiches but most of them had meat. There was a spicy falafel wrap, but it
was too expensive. I ended up having the same type of sandwiches that I bought
on that small supermarket by Laurier the last time that I lost control.

I used the tunnel network to walk towards Palais de Congres. I planned my route
with the CIBC ATM on the way in mind. By the time I made it back to the orange
line, the wildfire behind my ribs had burned through me and lighten me up for
everyone to see. Three stations behind my own, I sat down to an empty seat,
held my backpack to my chest, and sobbed quietly to my sleeves.

I cannot remember which station it was, when I looked at my phone. I did not
hear ir nor feel any vibrations. For some reasons I took it out and looked at
it and saw the three notifications from an unregistered contact.

"i'm sorry to hear, also sorry about being withdrawn from the world lately,
it's been sort of a t"for me thèses daysI also hope you are ok and that we can
see each other soon if you want"ough time, but this is no excuseof courseI
think everything went a little too fast in general"

I read them without realizing whom they were from. Their disorder made it
harder to figure out both their meaning and their sending. Until everything
clicked.

I still went to Clara's contact information at the bottom of her website to
confirm the phone number.

I did not feel better. Calm was nowhere among her words.

I made it home and I opened the bottle. I drank sip by sip, slowly until there
was nothing left.

I texted with my mum. She had asked me to let her know whenever I got home,
thus I did. She replied back quickly and asked me how my day had been. Careless
I was too honest.

"es como si subieran mis emociones a 11, todo se siente más fuerte,
irritabilidad, tristeza, alegría, enojo. es como si mis pensamientos gritaran
y van muy rápido. por eso voy a la biblioteca porque estar con gente hace como
que todo vaya más callado. pero igual no puedo evitar llorar en el metro
o caminando a la casa y la gente me ve raro.tengo pensamientos intrusivos como
inyectarme una y otra vez con la jeringa de las hormonas, en la pierna, en el
estómago, en la cara. o de de pronto caerme en las vías del metro. o de beber
una botella entera y tomarme todas las pastillas para dormir. por eso mi
psicóloga le mandó mensaje a sonny que le dijera a mis amigas de aquí que no
estoy bien y el psiquiatra me duplicó la dosis en dos semanas"

She asked me if I wanted her to come. I did. I really did, but instead I told
her it was not necessary.

We continued talking. I hoped I said the right things to calm down her
warranted worries.

I replied back to Clara with the usual week it takes her to get back to me in
the back of my head. The 9th of April became again a lighthouse in the
distance.

I do not remember if I put on alarm to get ready for Walter's thing. There is
a faint memory of it singing and me shushing it, but it could be from any other
day.

I decided not to go. I texted the group with Aliza and Majo to ask Aliza to
tell him that I was not feeling well given I mixed alcohol with my meds.

Around noon, Clara replied back saying she was not free tonight, but we could
meet for coffee in the afternoon. I remember last year when I first met her she
mentioned she does not like coffee. I made no mention of it. I said that would
work and offered her to pick a place or meet af Café Velours.

Minutes later, I replied to the text I had ignored from Majo. Then I sent her
the screenshot I took of the notifications inside the metro. She was surprised.
With reason, since she's always believed that she would not reach back. She
made notice of the i think everything went a little too fast and asked me what
she meant. I told her I did not know.

"me maybe, pero dice 'in general'"

She told me she's unwell, and I answered back that we knew.

"Yo lo sospechaba"Pero conforme pasa el tiempo"Lo confirmo jaja"Como que
quisiera no sentirse atraída por ti but she does"

"i have no idea what is going on on her side of the screen," I told her.
I wondered outloud about the idea of her wanting to see me to end things
correctly rather than just disappearing. Majo disagreed. She does not think she
has the emotional maturity to do something like that.

"we'll find out soon," I threw back. "i'm seeing her in 4h."

She tried to dissuade me from it. I am not well, she argues. She is not
mistaken.

She told me she's free around 15h and 15h30, that we could see each other.

"ambas sabemos que no voy a cancelar"

"You should"Verla no es una buena idea  "Al menos no hoy "She's not worth the
risk you are taking right now"

I said I knew all of that. I am well aware that I'll come back home feeling
worse than when I left. I wondered if this is another way of hurting myself.

"Todo el mundo a tu alrededor piensa que deberías estar internada," she wrote,
probably frustrated. "Las dos sabemos que no sobrevivirías un internamiento."

"Yeah café velours is fine, I'll be there at 5," just lightened up on my phone.

### Sunday, March 30th, 2025

"So, you said you have a hundred questions. I don't know if I have a hundred
answers."  I imagined that I would regret writing before seeing Clara. The
details would have been fresh in my mind. I would have been able to remember
the precise way words were said and how the bounce over before settling in. But
I predicted that after our meeting I would not have the mental energy to sit
down and write about whatever was going to happen. I got that right. I took my
pills before 21h and shut down the lights, giving up on the day. I fell asleep
not much after.

Am I avoiding it now?

I left home early—still not as early as I wanted at first. I took the Despentes
book with me. I thought I could get to the café earlier, find somewhere to sit
where I would not feel claustrophobic. I could sit down and read quietly before
her arrival. Make some very needed progress towards finishing the book that
I had to return today. I arrived with a headstart of 30 minutes.

Quietly I scouted the area as I walked from the entrance to the counter where
the barista welcomed me with a smile. I browsed quickly the menus, first the
tea ones then the regular one. I settled on the house's chai. I asked to see
the different sizes, despite knowing beforehand that I would have to get the
largest one.

— Est-ce que c'est ouvert, là-bas ? I asked him after giving him a 20 dollar
bill.

— Uh ? en bas ? Oui !

I looked at the door that leaded to the basement. I had been there before. The
last time I had gone to that café had been for my date with another French
woman. I have forgotten her name, but I could go back to instagram to check it.
Right until I deactivated it again, she was a frequent expectator of my
stories.

I headed instead towards the vacant table by the window. It was secluded enough
to not feel paranoid. The view outside would make it so I could see her
arrive—or for her to notice me before heading in.

I stood up and went for my tea. After siting back down, I closed myself by
putting my headphones in and continuing reading my book. I did my best trying
not to wait for a notification in my phone nor to look to outside the window.
What did I hope to win by not being the first recognizing the other?

Whatever I was playing at I lost by monitoring my watch. I doubled the effort
after the long hand had arrived to the 12 uptop.

I ended looking up as she was opening the door. I did not see her face until
after she turned left to leave her stuff on the bench across me.

She started with a friendly "hey", putting on a normalcy mask over this
almost-month since she promised to see me again soon. "How are you?"

I looked at her; red-hot hair, turquoise-cold eyes, and a warm smile. "Good,
good," I lied.

She asked if someone was coming or did we need to head over to order. I pointed
towards the counter as I mumbled my answer. This gave me another five minutes
to gather my thoughts before her return with a small glass of hot chocolate.

I had rehearsed many times what would be my first question of many questions.
I kept going back between how are you, really?, what happened?, or what is it
that you want from me? But in the end, it was what did you order?

We noticed the two dogs that were tied to the bench right outside our window.
One of them kept looking at me, questioning, curious. Then he looked at her.
She tried to take a quick picture of him, before he turned away.

Then we talked. For two hours we looked at each other and we talked. She would
turn towards me and meet my eyes, smile subtly, and then look away, shyly,
perhaps guiltily. I, instead, would leave them on her after her hiding, aware
that I could forget her face and that any of these could very well be the last
one.

She started with the job problems we had talked about on the ramen place;
confirming the money problems that Majo and I had inferred these weeks of
nothingness; and closing the list with family problems that I had not expected.

I told her about my not feeling well, not really. I mentioned the increases in
dosage and the sleepless nights. I was careful of not mentioning the public
crying, the intrusive thoughts, nor the self-destructive behaviour.
I definitely did not bring up the What now? group, nor the nights I was not
deemed safe to be left on my own.

We talked about deleting instagram—to which she quickly corrected me about it
being a temporary deactivation. I mentioned that for 15 minutes, I believed she
had blocked me. She was surprised and felt the need to say that she could not
think about why she would have done that.

I brought up our last meeting, the clumsy and awkward conversation that we had,
and subtly ask her if I had scared her. She looked away before confessing how,
afterwards, she had thought about it and realized I was looking for more. She
did not finish whether she meant more than she did or more than she could give
me.

Later, somewhen, I looked down at my empty glass as I held it with both hands.
I turned it gently, seeing the last bit of tea-stained milk swivel around
making the tea dust dance. Then I asked, "what do you want from me?"

She looked at me, for longer this time, and with a questioning face that did
not include a smile.

"I mean," I tried to explain myself, "do you want to keep seeing me?" I looked
down again at the glass, then away outside to the two dogs that remained there.
"Or do you want us to leave this here?" I went back to her eyes still on me.
This time they did not hide away.

She said she still wanted to see me. Then she mumbled something about not being
used to not meeting people randomly. I assumed she meant organically, referring
back to about how more than half-a-year ago we had met on a dating app. She
continued saying something about the expectations that come up with it.
I thought about how, with people you meet on the job, you don't have to plan or
intent to see them again. There is the job pushing both of them to meet.
Friends, even those whom you meet through other friends, have the friendship as
a motivator to schedule a next meeting. But what about us? We are not coworkers
and we are not technically friends. We met with the implied purpose of dating.
of getting to know each other and see if we are a match—our sense of humour,
our personalities, our sexual preferences. What reason is there left to see me
again for, if she knows there is no destination, no end-goal for her to arrive
to?

“Whenever you want me out of your life,” I started as yet again I looked for
refuge in the dancing bits of tea that remained in the glass I kept grasping
stubbornly, “please, don’t do it quietly.”

This time she looked at me with a veil I could not recognize—was it quiet guilt
or was it judgmental pity?

“No,” she broke the silence between us. “That wouldn’t be nice.”

Somewhere between one of the many—but certainly not a hundred—questions, she
looked towards the book that I placed over my coat. I could infer the awe in
her surprise when she asked me if I was reading Virginie Despentes in the
original French. After I confirmed her, she confirmed me by saying it was
impressive. I pushed her, trying to feed my own ego. She wanted to talk about
her writing style. She stumbled as she looked for a word to describe it.
Direct, messy, powerful. I thought back to myself asking chatGPT to recommend
me French writers that resonated with my own writing style. So I gave it to
her, raw, the word she was looking for.

"Raw," she echoed.

We talked about the concert. We brought it up several times, even up to the
very last moment, right before her bus arrived and she confirmed that I still
wanted to go to the show with her. As if she could not believe it. As if the
most reasonable outcome would have been for me not to want to.

“I’m glad that you didn’t hit me,” I misheard her say.

“Please, c’mon.” I objected, perhaps even offended. I thought of the accent
that tints our conversations and her words shifted as if a passing cloud moving
a shadow changed its shape.

“Oh,  hate!” I offered her, and explained the misunderstanding. “No, I don’t
hate you; even though I know I had reasons to.”

She said nothing.

“Were you disappointed that I didn’t hate you?”

She was quick to say no. “I don’t have that toxic behaviour.”

I thought about it. “It is something I would feel,” I confessed unprompted

“Yeah, now that I think of it, perhaps I have done it before. But not now; not
with you.”

Other unplanned subjects that were in between the conversations that I had
planned to have were the birthday party she was going that night; me becoming
a vegetarian, and the petty and narcissistic reasoning behind it; why she
studied English rather than French literature; when was it that she became
a red-head and what was keeping her from going back to being blonde—right after
this one, I started noticing the now more obvious roots behind her ears and on
her hair parting, and how, somehow, these imperfections made her attractive.

Shortly after the barista came with a tray and asked us if we were done with
our drinks, I told her we could leave whenever she wanted. She looked for the
timetable of the bus she was to take. Like that morning, months ago, when
I went back to sleep on her chest and she, softly and quietly, separated one by
one the tangled curls of my hair, she said we had 10 more minutes.

Outside, she asked me which direction I was going. I made no comment about her
knowing where I live and instead just pointed towards the opposite direction of
her bus stop.

I walked with her, claiming to myself the five more minutes that we had before
the bus arrival. Both of us were shivering with cold. I wanted, just like last
time, to reach towards her and bring her close. Precisely because of last time,
specifically our last kiss, I did not do it and I swallowed instead the thought
that concluded in me creating a new last kiss, again longingly, desperately,
and begging; potentially again unreciprocated.

I saw her bus even before it became a bus-figure in the horizon. "There it is,"
I felt the need to state outloud, as the faint lights started morphing into
a recognizable object. As it approached us and passed the lights that did not
turn red soon enough, I raised my right arm signaling for it, betraying my own
wish.

She opened her arms to me, inviting, welcoming, and confirmed outloud one last
time that I was going with her to the show. We hugged. There was no
shooting-star-like kiss this time. I did not turn my face towards her either.

She turned her back to me and went inside the bus that had already stopped for
her. As she climbed the stairs she looked back to me, her Eurydice to her
Orpheus. She raised a finger like she had just remembered something. I cannot
recall if she made a fruitless effort before the closing doors separated us.

I turned back myself and started my walk home.

### Monday, March 31st, 2025

"Hey, Sofía! [...]""hi Sofía, [...]""Hi Sofibug.""Hey Sofibug""Hey, miss you
too."  Last night I shared the last couple of paragraphs of the entry to María.
Her reaction was to laugh at my reference to Orpheus and Eurydice. I felt
slightly embarrased and doubted myself if it was too corny.

I did not show it; instead I doubled down.

"she turned back"literally and thematically", I added thinking back to Clara
turning on her feet, raising her finger, and looking towards me with a mild and
subtle desperation in her eyes; thinking further back to her unexpected,
disordered and unadorned messages. "but it's not the same", Majo has a point;
Orpheus turned because of love. I do not know what came back to Clara's  mind
that she suddenly wanted to share with me. I have not a fucking idea what
motivated her to come back from the dead with a hope you are ok and that we can
see each other soon.   "it's not out of love", guilt, pity, shame; whatever it
is, it's not the same; if you want.

"Oh god" was Majo's response. What else was there to say?

"Esto no es amor," she echoed my own concession before she struck,"Lo que tu
sientes se llama obsesión"

But, she had more to say. Her surgically precise observation was not enough.
What left me speechless was her next observation:

"She turned back so for her you faded away."  This past night, in contrast to
the previous ones, was much harder to fall asleep. I did not even feel the
normal dizziness or heaviness from the sleeping medication. I pushed away the
covers, took my underwear and started touching myself.

I closed my eyes and went back to that night of January: Clara's arms wrapping
mine, my fingers digging through her freshly dyied fire-red hair; the first shy
kisses I planted on her cheek in the middle of the night, then the daring pull
of her face towards me before the first risky one on her lips followed by her
reciprocation; can I take your clothes off and the dance that followed, my lips
exploring her body, traversing through her breasts and navel all the way down
to her sex; her bracing earthy taste that remained in my mouth all night; the
chance look upwards the precise moment she caught her breath and reached to
clasp my hand on her breast.

But it was fruitless. I had squeezed out all the erotic significance of that
night. My arm tired and I considered giving up, both on climaxing and sleeping.

I thought back to other moments; other nights, other women. Eventually, after
several tries, one of them was enough. I thanked my now stable levels of
estrogen for needing nothing more than turn away and cover myself back with the
covers to try and see if my masturbation had its desired effect.

It did not. All throughout the night I kept waking up and falling back to
sleep. I do not remember if I had set up an alarm, but I got out of bed before
9h.

I cooked myself some breakfast and brewed some accompanying coffee. It was
sufficient but unenjoyable.

I worked. I did my best to do something productive. I used this manuscript that
should have been ready since last year. It has been now longer the time that
I have been working on the small corrections needed than the frustratingly long
time it spent under review that Louis and I complained so much about.

This was my distraction. What I came back to in order to quiet myself from the
made up conversations I would have with myself. The rehearsal of the words that
I wish I would have said a couple of days ago. My reviewing of the countless
questions that I missed, the missing portion of the one hundred that remained
hidden in my head, in my chest, in my throat—except they were precisely the
opposite of countless, as the whole intention was to enumerate them; as if
reaching to that promised hundred would give me some sense of accomplishment;
look what you caused; witness the magnitude of the confusion and uncertainty,
see the darkness where you abandoned me.

Sometimes it is not even about Clara at all. Sometimes, for some other reason,
something inside expands in my chest and pushes towards my throat; my eyes
water and my respiration crescendos into an unmanaged chaos, tears flow but
whatever inside me remains, tearing, obliterating; devastating.

Then I come back down and sit down. Open a terminal or a word document, and
wait for this tempest inside me to calm itself. At least for a moment before
I think back to another question, or another half-thought that triggers the
cycle to begin again.
