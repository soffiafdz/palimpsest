# 2016 â€” 23 years old

## January, 2016

### 2016-01-01

The little white boxes, the date up here, everything looks white and empty.

I feel a strange void inside. With what could I fill it? Why should it be filled?

What if that emptiness and sadness is a part of who I am? What if taking it out is breaking myself? I am the person who I've been building this 23 years. Be it a mask or a persona, I am who I am.

I feel loneliness. I am lonely. Yesterday I drank. I didn't this much last week. I planned to drink only two glasses of wine. I drank a glass of white, another of red and half of the sweet one we picked up in Tecate. I drank a little cup of Edgar's porter beer. I drank another two big glasses of the sweet wine and then a cup of chocolate with irish cream in it.

They were talking and laughing and I felt dead inside. I remember those kind of parties. Those were my kind of parties for a time. Being nonexistent in a room filled with people. Wandering between laughs seeing their faces and hearing their voices masked in laughter. Drinking and emptying my glass. Drowning and hiding myself from existence.

I've always felt some scorn with everyone who can pass the holidays with their loved ones. Christmas, new year's eve, once again they left me this bitter taste in my mouth. Is difficult to think I missed these nights. I saw Chevo and Jessica's picture and I hated them for an instant. I envied them. They are with their loved ones.

I don't have those.

I have Catherine and that's it.

I sent her a text message answering the one she sent me. She informed me of the new year. I answered back with an echo of her own words. How was I then? There was playing another movie which couldn't distract me any more.

I didn't say anything. I saw the time and kept silence. Every one of those hugs was like a stab in the stomach. Like the feeling of a slap in my face. It wasn't the misery I felt that night when I realized I needed the antidepressants. It was that guilt and sorrow that covered me in a wave that came from every one of their looks. This was different. It was remembering they don't know me.

I'm not being dramatic. I can't be loved by someone who doesn't really know me. They know Ivan. They think they know him. They hugged him. That weird, long haired older son of Laura, the daughter of Cande. The shy boy and serious young man.
They might think they love me and not even all of them.

My aunt and uncle prepared special food for me. Would they even welcome me in their house if they knew how I am?

I don't want people to think of me with some kind of disease or perversion and yet I refer to it as if it were a nightmare. A couple of weeks ago I wrote it wasn't even a problem. I was hopeful and wouldn't let anything stand in my way.

What happened? Why do I feel this way?

Why do I want nothing more than to close my eyelids and let my tears stealthily escape, to stand up and walk towards the little fridge in the living room and grab a bottle of beer. I won't make myself stupid, I won't drink myself to sleep. I just want to erase these feelings. Grab one, maybe two, at most, and drink them slowly. Enjoy the dark and bitter taste of that dark ale. Dark and bitter like the feeling I want to get rid of.

This is the first day of 2016 and I'll end it in tears.

"I understand you, sometimes I think I just belong with you and it scares me. And then I look at myself and realize that I can talk to Miguel, and it scares me so much more because I can't even imagine how do you feel"

We came her from the United States. I ordered 10 pieces of chicken nuggets even though I ate more than I should. I still haven't finished my diet 7up and yet I flirt with the idea of grabbing the beer. I went to bed a couple of minutes shy from 6 in the morning. I was awoke when the door was banged. The first time I did get up, I let the cat in. The second and third I pretended to be asleep.

Most of the way home I was asleep.

I got home and opened the cellphone to see a notification from Paola Aguirre. She tagged myself in a picture with the other 6 people. I felt irritated. I read the description and it was an invitation to get together a day before my birthday to celebrate the king's day.

Paola said she would go and so did Catherine and Anahi. I didn't want to go. I didn't want to be near them. I remembered Chevo and Jessica and I don't want to see them nor talk to them. Then I saw Paola's comment. "Wuu, I have three beautiful girls confirmed already, one more to go and two wild creatures."

She doesn't know about me. Do I want to tell her? Do I really want to open up to another person? Is that what I need right now? I can't be in another room full of people who don't know me.

"You can not go, Sofi" "No, no I cannot".

I feel lonely, I wouldn't let myself live with the idea of isolating myself again. I have to go. It's not what I want nor what I need, but it's the closest I 'll ever get. They are the last "loved ones" I have left.

I have to try. Even if it keeps killing me from the inside and makes the void bigger and darker.

### 2016-01-02

I didn't took my pill today.

Is this how I want to start my year? Yesterday I feel that dark passenger again. I just now remembered that reference. That's how Dexter calls his psychopathic desire. He disassociates himself from his urge to kill making a dark persona which obliges him. I saw the series when I was in jr high. I was not nor am a psychopath. I am not even close. I was depressed and identified with his affective flattening. I was an impressionable young mind and identified with anything that could give an explanation to what I was feeling at the moment.

I don't know how to feel right now with the idea that a 14 year old boy prefers to identify with a serial murderer than a woman. I guess to me was more acceptable to be an actual monster than a transgender person.

I woke up a little before noon. I stood up and went to break fast. I ate the biscuit my father bought for me and then returned to bed. I can't recall if I dreamed something. I keep repeating those words in my mind. Every time I try to relive them they lose a little of their meaning. I can see the man and the baby but he mumbles now. His words don't mean anything. He looks at me and his lips move but I disappear. What did he say? "Look at the girl" is with my memory dictates. When I see it I don't hear no words anymore. He looks at me and they both smile. He points at me but stops at "Look", there is nobody there. I don't exist. They both look at a phantom.

"You say you like it but at the same time that it makes you feel fake", "it's like if it were something that I don't deserve".

"So, you don't deserve that people look at you this way, to be this way... are you going to punish yourself by going back to being Ivan?"

"No. No..."

I didn't get up again until after 3 in the afternoon. My parents both were in the living room. I almost forgot. Yesterday in bed I again had a secret affair with the temptation of telling my dad. I invited the idea to bed, let her get inside the sheets and embraced my in her arms. I closed my eyes and touched her body, held her as close as our bodies would let us. She got inside me and I imagined again standing in front of him. "Dad, I am trans".

I don't bother myself with a lengthy explanation or an easier introduction. I go straight to the point. I want to get it out of my system and get it over with. I stop thinking after that. After the words left my chest after it is known I don't want to imagine anything more. I don't want to fantasize about a reaction nor an answer. I don't want to draw him a face in my subconscious. I don't want to expect anything.

Today is saturday. Everybody goes back to their routine in a couple of days. My father will be the first one to return to everyday life Monday. Then Luis and my mother will go back to school in Wednesday.

Chevo answered Paola's post. He can't on Wednesday. He already has plans but he will change them. It's a date, I guess. I confirmed myself. Even if I had not said anything I'd give the same answer today.

What will I wear?

Who will I be?

I thought about that, too. How will Paola react? Will there be any comments of separation again? Boys and girls. Men and women. What if they see my phone? I tried to change the wallpaper in the morning. I wasn't going to put a tamer picture. I actually wanted a more obvious one.

Will I say something? We were going to talk to them. Catherine would, anyway. Will I?

They don't know my name. I can't tell them at the same time that I tell Paola about me. Will I tell her my name, too? Do I actually want to say it to any of them?

She has a baby now. Will she think I am a bad influence? Will her parents?

I feel lonely. I feel isolated. I am scared of asking for help.

"The important thing is that you know you have the support of your loved ones" that's what the other paola said to me.

Sure, it would be if I knew who they were.

### 2016-01-03

I was tempted to climb out of bed resigned and come here to type the words of today.

"My heart is wild and full of energy. Like a furious tiger throwing himself against the cells that hold him caged. It jumps and growls. It goes from here to there. His roar is full and strong. His movements quick and precise." I felt pulses of energy that wouldn't let me still. I wanted to get up and run. "I don't know from what to escape nor where to go"

I considered, too, getting up and going to the living room and played in the silence and darkness of the night. I could wake up early and readjust my own sleep schedule. I fell asleep near 4 in the morning. I woke up like 4 hours later. Was there some breakfast? No. Someone was in the living room. There were sounds of life. It wasn't Luis nor my father. Miguel was awake. I didn't know if the stole my idea or he did get up early. I was sad and tired. I feel like a failure. I wanted nothing. In the night I could smell my own stench but had no energy nor motivation to clean myself. The first thing I decided to do was to shower and shave. I'd shave everything. My chest, my pits, my legs and my face. I wanted to be clean and presentable. I took a pair of black underwear and chose it even though there were no plans for today.

Did I broke fast or showered first? I showered first. Luis and my father were downstairs when I prepared my food. Luis was cooking himself some soup and chicken. I heated the biscuit I left from yesterday. Last night my mother prepared the beans with bacon and chorizo. There were some slices from then. I threw the egg and made another one fresh. I put the bacon and a slice of ham. I ate it even before Luis started.

I am listening to an album of mexican music played as flamenco. I am drinking hot chocolate in a paper cup. Yesterday I drank a bottle of beer. Was it yesterday or the day before? Today is Sunday. Yesterday was saturday. It was yesterday, the day before was when we returned home.

My mother had mentioned going today to the united states. Did I thought of that when I decided to get ready?

"Are you going out?", my father questioned me. "No", I said.

I keep thinking of the words which I'll choose to invite him to know me.

"I never told you why I am taking the antidepressants. I do know. I don't like my body. I don't like being a man. I am not one. I am trans", here is, I think, where I wouldn't be able to hold the tears and break, "I want to change it. Please don't judge me, don't hate me, don't leave me".

I've been thinking about those words months by now. I almost can't believe I never got to wrote them down.

Tomorrow was supposed to be the day I'd call the endocrinologist. I was thinking of that yesterday, too.

"Hello, I'm looking for dr Magallanes? ... Yeah, my name is..." That's where I stop. Which is my name? Am I Ivan or am I Sofia? Which voice will I use? Which is the lie and which is the truth? The doubt burns me inside and shuts me down.

"Yeah, I'm a trans person. I looked up your contact info in a list of recommendations to the trans community. I am looking for someone who could help me with Hormone Replacement Therapy. I wanted to know if you could help me or give me some information about it."

I am scared. I feel I'm betraying my own family going out looking for him. Doing it without asking for their help. I have the money to pay for the first consultation. I have the motivation and readiness to really start and do it. I have the strong will to fight for who I am.

But I am not ready. I am not ready to do it by myself. I do need their help.

There lies my fear. I need them. I don't know what I'd do without their support.

I asked my mother about going to the United States. My father was irritated about going. Today is his last day of vacations. I understand him.

I felt hideous. I chose the wrong clothes. I wanted to look for new items.

"What do I buy?

"I don't know, you're with your parents and brothers"

"It doesn't matter, maybe I won't care"

"Then a blouse or flats... a purse"

"No, I do care."

I looked at the purses but found nothing. I liked none. They were colorful and big. Notorious. Like a big signal asking to be seen. I saw the clothes when my mother looked for some herself. I wandered by my own and found nothing. Even the sunglasses were all ugly.

Luis bought a pair, my mother two. My mother found a black, simple purse. I liked it. I saw it and felt envious. I couldn't even find male clothes in my size. I picked three long-sleeved shirts and a pair of black pants.

I tried them on and liked them. They are more ambiguous than my usual shirts.

 I may know what to wear wednesday and thursday.

Will I call? Will he answer? Will I dare to speak? To the doctor? my father? Luis?

"You area away in a trip. I know you won't see this soon, I don't expect you to answer. I know I've been an asshole. It's not your fault. Everything will be normal when you're back. I am sorry."

"Three days later I answered back... Not because I didn't have wifi, I wanted to scream it all. Hilda read it the day I received it. The hostal was crap. There was just wifi in the lobby and in one pc. Hilda was in the computer and she asked me if I wanted to use it. I told her no, I had nothing to check. At the end I sat and when I opened your notification popped up.
She asked me if I wanted her to leave, I answered her no. I read it and then she did.
'See? everything will be alright. You're almost back, it's the distance...' I don't know what else. I closed everything and we left. I remember that the 'normal' part was what I didn't like."

"Can I tell you something?...
Ok, I don't know how, haha.
When I see/read that, it hurts me, a lot. Sometimes it angers me. It's very weird. I remember when we start going to the hotel, when I called you April. I, then, saw you as two different persons.
I liked the girl, I wanted her. The boy was forbidden for me. He was my friend. I think once I've told it before.
...What I wanted to say is that I loved Ivan very very much. He was my best friend, like none other. He was fun and a creep, stalker and he loved gossip... he was complicated. We was too many things.
He hurt me, and maybe I hurt him. But, in truth, I don't resent him. I missed him too much, I needed him a lot.
Sometimes I remember him. In some I laugh and in others I cry. There is always affection in the memories. I feel I never said good bye to my friend. I really felt he never returned from Spain. I wanted to say it, that I loved him and he was special to me.

...

I read it and I feel crazy, but it's true, since the beginning I saw you as two persons. Then I didn't know who returned from Spain...
But I met you a year ago, Sofi. When RenÃƒÂ© cancelled you and you invited me to lunch. Maybe it is the same humor, some jokes... I don't know. It was different. Since the beginning of 2015 you were SofÃƒÂ­a to me. Funny, amusing, fragile, a gossiper and creepy, sensitive... Someone whom I'm crazy about."

She found a screen cap of the message I sent her when she was in Argentina. I finished with the pictures of Spain and the ones of my return. Now, I don't remember exactly when I am. Maybe the beginnings of last year. I know I saw the changes in my body. I lost a lot of weight and I noticed how I started to gain it back. It looked as if I was morphing myself in the person I was before I left. I did look feminine in a certain way in the pictures of there. I had some facial hair. It wasn't as smooth as I remember, but there is something delicate in my face. I missed that person. The one who was happy and comfortable in his own skin. There was a secret but it didn't burned. That person lived inside a fantastical bubble where there existed no problems. The bubble was going to burst and reality was near. That person decided to be again the boy who arrived. It was easier to suffer again than to deal with it alone.

I imagined a lot how it would be dying. Taking my own life. There was a recurrent thought of never returning from Spain. I wouldn't be back. There were signals that Yolanda did sense. Gifts, mementos, good byes and speeches. When somebody kills himself, all of his problems stay behind. It's as if he escapes and the people left has to deal with everything he left behind. Everybody cleans the mess he left. He doesn't have to deal with anything. He's gone...

I killed myself in a way. But I did return, too. I have and will have to deal with everything. All the blame and responsibility of my actions. The guilt, the problems, I'm here to deal with everything.

Why would Monica want to talk to me if I took his best friend away?

"You took more than his friend"

I am scared. I didn't call today.

Will I tomorrow? Will I ever?

Is it really easier staying this way than to face my fears?

### 2016-01-05

Catherine asked me in the morning if I could go with her to do her driving test. She would come pick me up at 8 in the morning. My mother and Luis would be getting ready too for their appointment for their passport. At the end, we postponed it to tomorrow. Tomorrow will be sixth of january. King's day. I'll go to Paola's house. I haven't decided what I'll wear. Everybody but my father will be at home. Do I care?

We were all in the living room when the Trevor Noah's daily show was on. The special guest was David Cross, the actor who played Tobias FÃƒÂ¼nke in Arrested Development. That show made me laugh so many times. I recommended it to Monica several times. She would blew me off several times too until she caved in. Game of Thrones was the last show she saw because of me. He was talking about his last show. He is the protagonist in a British-american series. "What is it about?", he was asked.

Nobody knows. I didn't know about it nor my dad or Miguel. He started making the synopsis talking nonsense. I was smiling, I was still in the mood from his last jokes about the republican candidates. "Is about a man in a farm who is trans, and starts to transform himself in a horse"

Everybody laughs and my smile fades away. Did they notice?

I dreamed about telling my dad. We were in a fancy hotel. I remember being alone in the room. There was a weird, long, red and cylindrical bag with a special watch inside. My father parked a red, flashy sports car inside the hall. In the night I stepped out of the room looking for the restroom. Was I looking for the women's? I remember finding it but still looking. I asked someone and they directed me towards another door, but that wasn't a bathroom, it was a computer room. Like a cafe internet.

I returned to the room. I remember having the urges to masturbate. When I woke up I tried to remember the last time I did. I can't I don't know. Today is 5th, so it's at least a week.

I haven't written about the important part of the dream. Is it an unconscious wish to forget it? It was nothing bad or painful. We were lying in bed. Maybe there was a tv or something. The room was dark but not pitch black. He started the conversation with a question born from interest and curiosity. "Did Catherine fight with her dad? Was she upset or something like that?" I can't remember if he mentioned the name of my mother or any other person. "[...] something about she hasn't tell him".

I could feel the light go up. The moment of truth, the insight. This could be it. I could say it now. I felt thrilled and happy. I was excited and scared. I see myself smiling now that I remember, but in the dream I could not see my face.

I was going to start, I had the words ready to come out. Everything was set in motion. I think the first ones did make appearance when I turned and I realized I was alone. He was gone. Nobody was there.

I don't know if it was some kind of glitch. I remember the feeling of seeing him again. The thankfulness of a second opportunity. Just when I opened my mouth to start again, he again was gone. I woke up after that.

Will he be gone when I decide to finally do it?

I woke up with the dream, the doubt about my masturbation habits and the realization that it was late and early at the same time. I stayed in the living room playing assassin's creed until 5 in the morning. Just now I'm realizing I was scared of falling asleep, of it being today. The fear woke up with me. I remember thinking about that falling asleep. What would I wear tomorrow or in my birthday. Would I say anything to Paola about me? Would I mention the name now?

With what words could I open up in the telephone when I call the doctor?

How would I introduce myself, ask him for help. I know his name but he doesn't know mine. Do I have to tell him? I'll tell him my deepest secret which not even my father knows.

"Hello, is this the dr Javier Magallanes?... Hi, I'm *Ivan*, you are an endocrinologist, right? I saw your name and contact in a list of recommended services for the trans community. I am trans myself and looking forward to start HRT. I wanted to know if you could help me?"

I couldn't. I woke up and time passed by while I stayed hidden under a blanket in my couch killing templars.

I am frustrated and angry. Maybe Catherine is as well. She doesn't understand the fear I have. Anahi asked if she were angry with her. It appears she will go tomorrow after all.

Why aren't I excited? Why am I stilled scared?

What is it that I fear?

How can I fight it if I'm blind? How can I ask for help if I'm mute?


### 2016-01-06

I woke up at 2:42am. I decided to sent Catherine a text message responding hers. I had asked about what to wear. I wanted to wear something feminine and I thought it would be easier to wear it today than tomorrow. I doubted because of Paola. When I woke up I was worked up in fears and expectations. I was angry of how ready I was to do anything. Late at night I feel reckless: I can tell my dad, I could go upstairs and wake him up and tell him. I could tell Luis about me and don't care about the consequences, it'll happen what will happen.

"Just think: will it be easier to be done at a later time? If not, you're just postponing it".

I could ask the endocrinologist and make an appointment. I could do anything. And as sure of that, I was sure that as the dawn breaks, my courage would break too.

I didn't fall asleep again. I haven't slept since then. I tossed and turned and wondered and thought and fantasized and worried and feared. I did everything but rest or sleep.

I wore the leggings. I wore the red new shirt. I put on make up, but just the foundation. It covered a little of the shadow on my face, but by the evening there were some signs of it. I felt ugly. I felt hideous. Nobody nor nothing could make me feel otherwise.

I didn't want to go or did I? I wanted to say it, maybe. I thought about it. I wanted to call the endocrinologist, too. I wanted a lot of things I couldn't do. Maybe that's why I hated myself. I feel caged in my own body. I absolutely hate that fucking phrase. What's the difference with what I feel? I'm not trapped in a wrong body. I'm trapped in a useless one, a broken one.

We went to take the driver's license. She did her test and passed it. I just answered some questions and payed. There was no printer so neither of us has our new plastics. I'm 800 pesos less. That's what the endocrinologist session will cost. It's less than the 60 dollars I had expected.

It's still a lot. Money I don't have. I do have it, but not more than for one session.

I did call. We broke fast in the torta plaza. We didn't want to spend and yet we bought the most expensive of the breakfasts. The sour cream on them made me a little sick. Or maybe it's just the storm of emotions that destroys me from the inside.

I read the words I type and they seem so pathetic. It's like reading the thoughts of a whiny little bitch. A little idiot who thinks the world conspires against her. God does have a plan, and its to make things as difficult and painful for me.

If I were him I would hate me, too.

I feel the tears be born in my eyes and I think I deserve them. I feel this pain and I want it. Why do I want to punish myself? What did I do that makes me think I actually deserve this? Is my own existence fault enough?

We were parked outside the park where I spent some nights listening to music with Monica. Now it wasn't my car. Now I wasn't a boyfriend. Now I could feel, now I let myself experience the emotions, now I was alive.

Maybe a part of me still blames me for it. Was life really easier when I was dead, when I was a walking corpse?

I fought with the idea of calling or not. I wanted to, every little part of my body screamed like the patients waiting for their turn in the karaoke. My brain, my mind was the young intern who couldn't deal with it. Who was so engrossed in her own problems that everything was impossible. I wanted to scream. I was both the patients and the intern. I wanted to scream at me and scream back. I wanted to grab me by the throat and made me do something. I wanted to fight back.

Every moment was an internal fight. Every hit hurt me.

I did call. The secretary answered. Yes, there he works. The consultation is 800 pesos. I would make an appointment as a first time. It would be until late march.

I knew it. It was done. I could make it then. I didn't. I passed again. I can still call tomorrow. I can check it with Rene, ask for his opinion. I can still call tomorrow. Why do I still hurt? Why didn't the pain go away? What more do I want from me?

 We went and Paola was alone with her baby. Chevo and Jessica were the next to arrive. They had this private joke about a pregnancy test. We were isolated again. We were left apart. Catherine felt what I feel all the time.

I always envied people who had their families here with them. I felt my own were in Mexicali. If I were there I wouldn't be alone. In reality, when I am there, I am still alone. They have their friends there. Wherever I am, I don't belong.

Is it my fault? Is it something I did? The last time we saw them was in the premiere. No, that was the last planned time. The last was an accidental one.

Am I mad at them or at me?

I feel lonely. I feel helpless. I need help. Do I have anyone to ask it?

Did I make this to myself? Is this really my fault?

What did I do wrong? Where did I fail? When?

What can I do? I can't take this anymore.

### 2016-01-07

"You are a very special person. You have the ability to smile despite all the difficult things that have happened"

Two years ago I was supposed to be a man. I think about that young and confused person who couldn't recognize himself in the mirror. He who would stand in front of his reflection and look at it curious, studying it, sweeping every little detail and comparing it with who he was supposed to be. He didn't recognized himself and now I do.

I should had been a man two years ago. I wasn't and I still am not. I still have a penis and testicles, my back is as broad, my voice is as deep, my hands and feet as big, I am as strong. But I am not one. I am not empty either. I know who I am. I am not a lie because there is no truth.

My legs are shaven. My stomach and chest are too. My hair is even longer. In my drawer I have almost as much woman's underwear as man's. I have a couple pair of bras and tights. I have a dress and a skirt in my closet. I have a couple of woman's jeans and leggings. I have that pencil bag from jr high filled with make up. I've worn them all outside my house, in public, and be seen as who I feel am.

I used to try to find me in my dreams. I can't remember the last one where I even paid attention to the gender I were. I have stopped looking for myself.

I am not a man and I am not a woman. I am sure of being a person. I am something else, too. I am unique, I am me. I have Catherine and Anahi. I am not as alone as I thought.

I have started my adult life and stopped being the man I was never meant to be.

...

I woke up again in the early morning. An hour past midnight and I couldn't sleep again. I saw the messages from Consuela and Alberto. They made me smile and yet I didn't open them. I kept trying to sleep in spite of me knowing it was all for naught. I sent Catherine a message telling her that I woke up and I'd hate to stay awake again. I plucked my eye brows, I walked in the living room and returned to my bed. I tossed, turned, uncovered and covered myself over and over again.

I may had fallen asleep a couple of minutes just before the alarm started. After my dad left home I went for a towel and got ready. Nobody was awake. I was supposed to wear jeans. I would go with my parents and be with them in the afternoon. I put legging instead. I didn't care. I did it anyway. Did I want to be noticed and asked?

Catherine came for me and took a picture when I got in the car. I saw the pictures. When I looked at myself in that little screen I liked what I saw.

I feel so different to two years ago. It was one of the best and worst birthdays ever. It started awfully with a fight and tears and Catherine gave me a beautiful journal with a lot of happy memories in its pages, and in which I would later fill its blank ones with my fears, worries and sadness.

I was confused and sad and scared. I was afraid and hateful and angry. Now I am still scared but I have stopped being confused.

Last year I tried to cover everything and pretend nothing happened.

Today I went to break fast in a restaurant where Catherine always wanted to go. We were welcomed in darkness by an unheard welcome. I didn't hear the gender we were referred with. I did not ask. I didn't want to ruin how I was feeling, spoil the image I saw in that little screen. The waiter saw us and referred to us as two women.

The lights returned and we payed. We parked outside our high school and talked about yesterday. I cried strongly after drinking the beer. I lied in bed and sobbed without a care of being listened.

I saw rene and he welcomed me. He did not mention how I was dressed. I did.

We went to the hotel. It was really nice.

I called to the clinic. I asked Rene, no, I confessed to him my fear of waiting and being told that I would not be treated. I could always go and ask in person or grab a little presentation card. I ate my fear and called after being naked and warmed in Catherine's embrace.

Nobody answered and we returned to bed. Before leaving I tried again.

"I called yesterday to make an appointment with Dr Magallanes. I would like to make it"

"Now he's not free until April"

Sure, whatever, it was fine. What was a couple of weeks later? I reminded her it was my first time. I told her my name. My official name. She asked me for the rest so I gave the first, too.

Was I referred by someone? No. Why did I not tell her the name of Rene? He did not refer me there. Maybe I could had said it. Maybe I shouldn't had. It never occurred to me to ask him.

"What is the motive?" I expected that question and answered it as calmly as anyone could. It was like if I had said I had a typical flu. I could bet she would never guess how I've been dreading even to call or tell it to anyone else. Even I was surprised when I realized how the act of saying it out loud scared the shit out of me.

"Hormone Replacement Therapy"

She hesitated and asked me to wait a little. I heard her coughing away from the phone. She returned and told me awkwardly.

"uhm, when someone with, uh... this situation... comes, the doctor asks them to be seen before by a psychiatrist..."

I cut her midsentence and confirmed. "Yes, so I need a letter from my therapist?" "Yes"

She gave me the date and I even forgot to ask the location of the clinic.

Now I am almost sure it's in the Prado Clinic. My fear was evaporated. He sees patients with "my kind of situation". He has a protocol. He won't doubt me or judge me. I just need a letter from Rene. Will he give it to me? Will he?

"I am terrified of asking for help and being denied" Would he be the one to tell me "Sorry, but no"?

What if he's not enough? What if I'm denied because he's not a psychiatrist? He did prescribed me antidepressants. He is a medical doctor. What if that's not enough? What if I am not trans enough?

Do I doubt of convincing him or convincing myself?

"My name is Ivan, and I'm so macho"

Jessica and Monica wished me a Happy Birthday. "Thank you, I hope we see each other soon" "Thank you, Monica, wish your dad a happy birthday from me, too".

I waited for that moment for a lot, and when it actually came I didn't know what to do... What would I answer back? I had thought for a time to saying something cold and succinct like a "thx". I had thought about staying silent. Then, something cold but just, "you didn't have to do this for a compromise"... that wouldn't be just, that would be full of resentment. Thankfully I did nothing of those things.

"Yeah, tomorrow because I'm already in my bedroom", she answered back. Whatever. "Sure", I said instead.

I saw the pictures of my birthday. There are a lot of us and a lot of me alone, too. I'm supposed to hate pictures. Not seeing myself, reminding me of how I look, how far apart I am of a pleasant image of who I feel as. I see them and I look happy. I have a wide smile which shows most of my teeth. It's like if I was looking for things to hate, to feel bad about. My clothes were fine, my face was ok, my hair, too. My teeth... those weren't as white as they should. Sure I could whine about them.

I saw the video and found what I was looking for. My voice. I have certain coarse movements but they're almost imperceptible, some signs in my face but they're minuscule. But my voice, that one is obvious and enormous. It's not really that low, but there is something there. It's like I'm hiding something but the bulge can be seen covered. It hears like the bulge under my legs looks.

I remember the gestures I had to do to the waiter so I could hide it. I seem like a shy person, but do I look like a transvestite, too?

That's not what I am. I can't be a man wearing woman's clothes if I am not really a man. Can I say I am not a man if I haven't started with the hormones and the changes?

When I'm asleep my body looks exactly like the one from a man and there are no consciousness where to place the dysphoric feelings and thoughts.

Would anybody be wrong in saying my corpse is a man's one when I die?

I almost forget to take my pill today. I got distracted by the anxiety and thrill of having the appointment.

I should be looking for jobs, I should be getting ready my papers for the process of getting my certification. I can't do anything about the appointment until I see Rene next week and tell him about what I was told. Saying to him that I made the appointment, that is set and that I'll need an evaluation.

I read the post of a Human rights lawyer where he talked about how important it was the Supreme Court of Justice in the social advances there were in our country in the matter of LGBT nature. He was a lawyer who studied in the National Autonomous University and in Essex, a university in the UK. I remember the Across the pond organization. I could send them a mail and ask them for help with the application to their universities.

Doing what I was so afraid of gave me a new perspective of the difficulty of things.

I am still scared of asking for a job. There are so many things which I'm nervous about. Applying for a job, applying for a master, applying for a scholarship, the results of the test, the meeting with the doctor. All of them has to do with how I do, their judgements and evaluations.

I am scared of being seen. That's what I want but am afraid of.

I don't know how the doctor looks, the way he talks, his age. What does it matter? I could hate the guy, but if he can give me what I want I'll keep meeting him. I don't want a friend, I want a doctor.

No, I need a doctor, and I do want a friend. I wanted to talk about it. Tell it to someone, anyone. Catherine was with me. Rene I wouldn't see until next week. There was Anahi, and the list was done.

What about telling Anahi scared me?

I did tell her but I acted excited instead of scared. She told me she was glad and congratulated me in a way.

Do I want somebody to be scared and nervous? My parents would be. Do I want to tell them? I do.

What am I waiting for? What am I scared of?

Which would be easier? Telling I am trans or telling I will do something about it?

### 2016-01-09

I look around and see all the things in the wrong places. Several times I've tried to gain the motivation to actually clean up my room. I have counted the number of places where I need to order everything. The little box in the bookcase, the one where I have the prescription and money. The upper side I use as a shelf. The shelf over it. The three on the wall from the other side. My desk.

I wanted to go the US. I had a package there since almost a month. The gift for Catherine and Luis were there. My little cases for the contact lenses. Now I don't have an excuse to not wear them. I can try them again. Who were the one that asked? "Was it hard getting used to them?"

My mother. Yeah, she asked Ivana, the psychologist niece of my aunt. She's working in an office. I could work in a place like that. Human Resources. The Mexican in my class in Salamanca works in an office, too. I could find something somewhere.

Yesterday I passed the pictures to Catherine. She really really liked them. She liked how she looked and how I looked. She sent me back the one where I am holding her gift, the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind DVD and smile at the camera. "You look so girly here"

Did she mean girl as in a child or as in a woman. "Both". I looked small and feminine. My small, my clothes, my hair. She really really likes me. I used some of those pictures as display pictures in several social networks. Twitter I put one clear where I smile in Rene's building. A close up of my face outside the elevator.

Even in Facebook where I still have that other name I put one of those. I am drinking coffee so the cup covers my red lips. The off-focus of the shot hides the softness of my face and my glasses blurs even more the color of my eyelashes. I look "normal" I am an essence there. Maybe for unknown people I might look like a woman, but people who do know me can recognize me.

Maybe it's like my uncle's wedding rehearsal, when my mother introduced me to that relative of my father, he was looking for an Ivan in my brothers. "Oh, you? I thought you were a woman".

I remember his remark in the actual wedding when he was looking for me again. Was it you? he again asked Miguel. "He had his hair over his face", mocked with a gesture of his hands on his cheeks. Did I care? I guess If I hadn't, I wouldn't be mentioning it now.

I was so terrified of even wearing a bra outside of the hotel room. Now I wear women's pants in my own birthday. I get out of my house with my face colored. As if I wanted to be seen. I want them to notice, to ask, to be interested.

They are interested, I want to tell them. Maybe we both are trapped in a continuous game of evitation.

I have to tell them. No, I don't. Do I?

It will be harder saying I am trans and just about to start treatment than saying I am depressed and confused about my gender. It will be even worse to tell my dad I am trans and already taking hormones to change my body.

Will it be like if I'd tell him I'm taking a slow poison? I'm slowly killing the son he thought he had. The potential person he had created in his own mind.

I'm a killer, a murderer. I will kill a brother and a son. I have murdered mercilessly a friend, a best friend. I didn't think twice before killing a lover.

I remember one night of drinking where I told Catherine how I really felt. I was really drunk and took advantage of the desinhibition caused by the alcohol. I told her how I, Sofia, that feminine germ which was hidden and forgotten inside that young and sad boy, was actually what saved his life. I gave him the energy to move on. I gave him the hope of life, the motivation of a dream and a goal. I was the spark of life that kept him moving, that forbade him of giving up and stepping off.

Would he, me, had really killed himself if it weren't for this realization?

Or was the realization of me the one that killed that mask?

Am I a savior or a executioner?

### 2016-01-10

"Ivan, you are Sofia, right?"

He didn't say those words today. Yesterday was when we caught the second half of Vanilla Sky in the television. I put it on.

I am in Salamanca, Spain. I love walking through these streets. It feels haunting when you turn around and can't even fathom the ages of the buildings by your side. I am not alone. Maybe we're walking to the cinema. Raul and Consuela are by my side. We just passed the avenue of our house. We crossed the way to the park. Raul talks about thinking of a spanish movie he can show his friend. I say I don't know many, but I like "Abre los ojos". "Yeah, everything but Almodobar"

We went several times to the theater. Her, a belgian movie, we even watched a spanish one. 7 vasque last names. There was a french one. Les garÃƒÂ§ons et Guillaume, ÃƒÂ  la table!. I didn't what was about. It was the story of Guillaume. He was one of many brothers in his family with a peculiar relationship with his mother. The actor played both the part of Guillaume and the mother. The character himself overidentified with that persona. He was a feminine men. He went to Spain, Sevilla. There, his abroad family introduced him to the flamenco dance. They taught him, by mistake, the role of the woman. It was a comedy where the punchline of every joke was his feminine role. I can't remember if that was one of the firsts or lasts. It could explain my own repression.

I remember writing about it. I remember feeling sick. I hated every scene. I hated the character and his portrayal. I hated the conclusion where he was just confused and his first relation with a woman cured him of his feminine personality. He was a "normal" man with a normal voice.

Raul laughed. Was Consuela there? Did I cry or was I angry? Maybe I just stayed silent. I remember not laughing.

Another movie we watched was Dallas buyer's club. There I could see Jared Leto played the role of a transgender woman. I don't remember any comments about that one. I don't remember identifying with that character. Was it gone already?

I saw it later, I was here already, and I didn't either.

Tomorrow Catherine will call the DMV to ask if the printer is ready. If it is she'll pick me up and after her therapy, we'll pick them up. Maybe we can go downtown and buy charcoals for our little hookah. The tobacco will expire soon. The day after tomorrow I will go to her house. We will await the results of our tests and use that as an excuse to see each other. We might see the movie she gave me on my birthday. We might smoke a little or drink one of the holiday beers I still have.

Am I nervous? I won't graduate with the GPA I thought I would have. I made a mistake when I took the average. Maybe I left out one of the classes when I divided by the total. It turns out I'll have a 94 instead of a 98. It is still a really good one. I might be the third or even the second place out of the whole class. There was this fantasy of me being Magna Cum Laude. How ironic it would be being the best of my class from a career I'm not sure of pursuing.

Summa Cum Laude is almost as good. Hilda might had lowered her own GPA, too. I would not give the speech anyway. I would not have the words anyway. Almost all of my problems right now consist in things I have to say but can't.

Another fantasy I have consists precisely in those results. Being high enough. Having one of the bests. Being mentioned while I walk there. Being given a medal, invited to go to the DF to receive my price. Going to the DF. I might start hormones this first semester of the year. Why do I still want to go there? I am scared of starting now, asking for a letter, asking for them. I am scared. How can I fear waiting even more?

Yeah, DF is where I can still change my name. It's the second step, the next goal. There is the master I want to attend. The city. The capital. There is far enough to escape this life.

The next day, Wednesday is when we will see Chevica. Catherine will talk to them. Do I prefer not saying anything because I don't see a point or because I am, too, scared of talking to them?

The day after that I have to tell Rene about my appointment. Ask him about his approval.

I am scared of his reaction just like I am scared of my dad's.

### 2016-01-11

"Thank you, my beautiful girl"

Today Catherine picked me up. We were going to pick up the licenses. She would go first to her therapy. We agreed to meet a little past noon. I had more than enough time to get ready and wait for her. My cell phone marked a little past 8 in the morning when I first woke up.

I dreamed with Monica. I told Catherine when we were sitting waiting for our food next to the frikiplaza. "Have you had any sex dreams?" I had asked her in our way downtown.

I first dreamed I was in a hotel room. I had invited Monica to come over and time passed before I began to think she would never arrive. We were going to watch a movie. She did come. I was relieved that everyone was asleep. Nobody had to know. I guess I felt guilty already. She didn't share my relief or fear of being noticed and the first thing she did was say hello to my parents.

When we were alone in my room, I tried to turn on the television but noticed that it didn't work. There was some kind of static or visual noise that interrupted whatever was on. The plans were ruined. We couldn't do what we were supposed to. Was I or she the one who proposed anything else?

I just remember the kiss and the guilt. I thought about her boyfriend but not my girlfriend. Why did we kiss? Were we going to do anything else? I saw her bare breast. What happened?

I remember scenes or isolated images from another dream. Sand. I remember footprints left in the sand. I remember the noise of the sea waves. I woke up inside my dream outside a local which sold alcohol. No. There was something before. We were lying on the sand. Somebody was by my side. Was she or was Catherine? I remember her, her voice. She talked sweetly to me. She proposed me, no flirted with me. She teased me about modelling something for her. It couldn't be. I remember about myself. About us. She couldn't deal with it. She can't, she doesn't. That couldn't be real. That wasn't happening. Maybe then I woke up outside that place. I was hungover and asked for a beverage. It was like the liters we use to drink. I remembered and corrected the order "without alcohol". They laughed at me. I didn't care. I couldn't give the first sip when I really woke up.

Funnily enough Catherine remembered me parked in my neighborhood. She masturbated, no, she got turned on with the memory of me being on top of her from the first time we went to the motel. The image of my legs surrounding her, covered in tights, the feeling of the skirt covering both of our bodies, all those sensations lasted her, easy, for two weeks.

Moments before that, she freaked out. She accelerated and had to park. I put the brake and hugged her. It was the idea of me stopping the relationship with Chevo and Jessica. Me really being alone. Having nobody else but her.

She had told me before how she felt awful thinking about her loneliness and how it must be for me, who has even less acquaintances than her. Maybe that was it. Maybe was that plus the burden of the expectations I put her being the only one who can support me.

I'd lie if I write her that I felt nothing while I hugged her. That it didn't hurt me. That I was as calm as I could be and I cheered her up because I am used to the idea of being alone.

I was scared. That's the feeling I battle most of the time. I'm scared of being left alone. I'm scared of being too much for anyone. I'm terrified of keep counting the people, my loved ones, whose life was easier the moment they left me.

I thought about reaching out to Melissa, to Hilda. I plan on telling Paola about me. Using her as practice before I tell my dad.

"I was at almost nothing from standing up and going to my father's room to actually tell him about me", at first I thought I was exaggerating when I wrote that to her. Then I felt nervousness when I realized it was true. I did think it. I did considered it and review the words in my head.

I bought a gift for Luis. I bought a 2x2 rubik cube. I have it with the cube I bought for him before.

I'll give him both. I got angry with his remarks about my own gift, but I love him. I will tell him sooner rather than later.

I already wrapped Catherine's gift. I filled a notebook sheet with our names and little messages. Then I wrapped the timeturner inside it. I used the wrapper from her gift to me two years before, and that I put inside a little box which I taped with the tape of the INE.

It is a nice gift.

I love her. She's the person that I fear the most about losing.

I wouldn't be here without her help. I can't even imagine where I'd be without her.

Esta vez no es SofÃƒÂ­a quien escribe las palabras, soy yo, Catherine, su novia. Es tentador revisar dias anteriores, no sÃƒÂ© porque si ya he leido fragmentos de su diario, dias en especifico que ella me deja ver. Me dijo podia hacer trampa, o dejarle un mensaje. Me parecio buena idea, pero ahora no se que escribirle.
Hace casi un aÃƒÂ±o que empece a hablar contigo Sofi, veo hacia atras y parecen aÃƒÂ±os, es tan largo y tan corto al mismo tiempo. Hace un aÃƒÂ±o ni siquiera imaginaba que mi vida seria asi. Que me llamaria tu novia, que te diria a ti mi novia, que hubiese tanta confianza entre nosotras como para caminar desnuda delante de ti, para que vieras mi relacion con muÃƒÂ±eca, para que me vieras estallar como lo hice ayer en mi carro. Me encanta estar a tu lado, no encientro otra palabra, simplemente me encanta, disfruto tu compaÃƒÂ±ia, me encanta cada aspecto de nuestra relaciÃƒÂ³n, me gusta hablar de temas complicados, temas que nos sobrepasan como todos los que estamos viviendo en este momento. Me gusta hablar de nada y solo abrazarte, sentirte cerca. Me gusta tontear, tener nuestras curas. Me gusta que me sigues la corriente y a veces me toca a mi seguirte la corriente, me gusta cuando me sorprendes como hoy en el caminito de CECUT. Te quiero tanto, a veces no se que responder cuando me preguntas por que te quiero. Quisiera abrirte mi cabeza y vieras lo que pasa ahi dentro cuando te veo, cuando me tocas, me besas, cuando puedo oler tu cabello, al sentir que tu mano busca la mia y entrelazamos los dedos.
Tengo miedo de perderte, de lo cambios que podrian pasar, de trabajar y tener menos tiempo para ti. Para nosotras. Tengo miedo de la reacciÃƒÂ³n de mi padre cuando sepa de nosotras, son personas tan importantes para mi, tu y el, no soporto la idea de lastimarlos.
Solo quiero desaparecer contigo, irnons lejos, solo y yo, abrazarte y no dejarte ir nunca.
Aun siento cosquillitas en el estomago cuando te beso, cuando agarras mi cara. Aun recuerdo nuestra primera noche juntas, el como nos abrazamos para dormir, mi temor de que no se repitiera, de que a ti no te hubiera gustado tanto como a mi. Esa primera noche temia que nos soltaramos, que en algun momento de la noche dejaramos de tocarnos, que te dieras la vuelta y en la misma cama hubiera distancia entre nosotras. Eso no paso, nuestros cuerpos nunca dejaron de tocarse.
Me encanta dormir contigo, aunque hemos pasado noches donde ya no dormimos abrazadas, se siente bien, ya no tengo el temor de sentirte lejos en la misma cama, se que estas conmigo.
Me has apoyado enormemente Sofia, me tienes paciencia, simplemente estas ahi para mi. Asi como has estado para mi, quiero estar para ti, me esfuerzo por darte lo mejor de mi, porque lo mereces, te lo mereces Sofi, te lo he dicho anteriormente estoy orgullosa de ti, de ti como persona, por tus cambios, por tus logros academicos, personales, por todo. Eres inteligente, cariÃƒÂ±osa, fuerte, aunque no lo veas en ti, se que lo eres, y se que puedes con todo lo que se viene para ti, aunque ahora lo veas demasiado, se que puedes.
Me gusta pensar en un futuro contigo, en casarnos, en vivir juntas, pensar en viajar, alguna vez hablamos de tener una casa, de cuantos y como serian los cuartos que tendria. Hablamos de paises, y en verdad todo me da emocion, todo lo quiero contigo.
Me gustas, me gustas mucho, me gusta tu cabello, esos chinos me vuelven un poquito loca, me gusta ver cuando te baÃƒÂ±as por como se te ve el cabello mojado, ver que tan largo es realmente. Me gustan tus ojos con y sin lentes, tu mirada es tierna y dulce, expresiva, puedo ver cuando estas triste o enojada, y he podido ver las veces que estas feliz. Me gusta tu sonrisa, realmente la considero bella. Me encantan tus labios, el grosor y la textura que tienen, me encanta besarlos, probarlos con mi lengua. Me gusta tu cuerpo, aunque se te haga dificil de creer, me gustan tus pechos, son pequeÃƒÂ±os y suaves, me gustan tus pezones. Y creo que no seguire porque luego me caliento.
Hace dias pensÃƒÂ© preguntarte, como sabes cuando amas a una persona, que se siente, que es diferente entre querer y amar, porque jamas me habia sentido asi con alguien, jamas habia sentido, pensado, deseado asi a alguien.
Te quiero, te adoro Sofia.

"I'm angry, no, upset..., angry, I don't know. I guess I am something with you. Because I can't pinpoint it, but no matter what, since lately, I don't feel like I flow with you two"

We talked. I decided to dress in a masculine way and I ended up wearing a bra and make up. I looked manly, though? No. I looked feminine but I did look like a boy. It doesn't matter. The meeting was planned to be at 3 o'clock. We didn't touched the point until later in the afternoon.

Today Catherine picked me up and took me to school to ask for the papers need for the license. From there we went to eat. We ate a soaked sandwich and a taco. Like the one we tasted in Guadalajara.

Yesterday I didn't do my own words. She gave me a hand there. She typed a little message from her own computer. Meanwhile, I was sitting in the jetta with my dad. We were parked next to the road with a flat tire. I was wearing the leggings and still have a little bit of paint on my face. Did my father notice? Did he stay silent on purpose. I considered seriously the idea of blurting it out. Letting it out and just dealing with the consequences later. Stop wondering how freezing is the water and just take the jump. I didn't. We finished the trip to the tires place and just waited there.

Why was I in need of a new tire?

Two nights ago, we were waiting for the results of the Last Test. We had planned to me going to Catherine's house and there look at the results. I was already in bed. We both were. Claudia was the one who posted that the results were already public. I could had just looked them up right then and there. I waited for Catherine to look for her pass and her folio number.

While she was away looking and got lost inside my own tablet. Why was it that I arrived to that thought? What exactly made me think of the master? I looked for the postulation of the master this year. It started a couple of months before. It will end in two weeks. I have two weeks to make the decision.

I remember now. I wanted to see the dates. I was thinking in the results of the test and how the one with the highest points gets a medal in the capital. They pay that person a round trip to pick it up. What if it conflicts with my other appointment? What if the dates of the tests and interviews of the master conflicts, too? That was what I wanted to know. I, instead, learned that I had just little more than ten days to make a decision.

I was so perplexed by it that I didn't care about the results anymore. I saw them and couldn't understand completely what they said. I got the highest marks. I was happy and excited. I then, stopped caring. Just like the child my mother described when remember our past, that little kid who lost the excitement of that new toy faster than he could smile.

Those results won't give me a job. My grades won't give me the rights to a future.

I went to Catherine's house anyway. I gave her the beers and the sleeping bag and her gift. I filled a little notebook paper with our names and little messages. I wrapped that in the wrapping page of my own present and then put it in a cylinder box which I taped shut with the tape from the elections.

I wore the leggings to her house. I was seen by her mother and father and uncle. I was seen by my own parents later in the night. I was seen but not really recognized. Her mother asked her today if I wasn't cold. I wore those pants like the kids wear them nowadays.

We went to the talk about stars in the CECUT about stars and then I returned her home. Twice was I mentioned as a man. They used the neutral masculine and I was upset by my own sad reaction. Why does it have to upset me? I look like a man. I know it. There's nothing I can do right now to change it. Why does it hurt? I already started and did everything I could.

No, I haven't. I still don't change my own voice.

What of it scares me?

I practiced it on my way home. I was hearing me, wondering how different would it be heard by other ears, when the car jumped as it passed that crater in the road.

When I got home and moved it again to park it in the pick up's place I noticed it and my dad did, too.

"Tell your Mom we will return soon"

I have two weeks to make a choice. I have two weeks to tell everybody in time.


### 2016-01-14

What is this that I'm feeling?

Did I dream something today? Did this sorrow accompanied me the whole day? When did it start?

I remember turning the alarm off. Catherine mentioned something about a dreams of hers and I tried to forgot mine. Yesterday I wrote a little fragment of the day's writing in twitter. I hate that page. I have a profile picture there. Why did I put it? Catherine told me I look god. Is it because of the picture that I don't like it? No. I feel alone. I feel I talk by myself. I receive mails of notification of being liked and re-tweeted. What am I expecting?

 Anahi posted the status of the death of Alan Rickman. I was going to therapy today. Yesterday I couldn't find my own log. I looked for it everywhere. I did find it.

Today I was going to dress masculine. I looked... I can't find the word. This is not normal, nor usual. This is... expected? by who?

"Me waiting for my boyfriend to notice my haircut"

Why did that post make me so angry? Was it the mention of her boyfriend? Was it the comment of her Dad or the likes? Was it that he deleted me, and my mother still have her? Is it that she still has me? That I kept her, too?

I told Rene about the university and the test and the call and everything. He gave me reasons why I could, why it was possible and I could do it. Maybe he really thought me capable. It wasn't until I told him that I see waiting as the most reasonable choice that he reminded me how he stated this was something that should not be rushed.

He hesitates and goes back and forth with the pronouns. I don't care. I don't mind.

The gas dispatcher fooled me. He welcomed me with a plural neutral greeting. I asked for the amount I wanted and waited. "served" he said in the feminine form.

"Was he mistaken? He was referring to the gasoline."

This time I was right.

"Yeah, they sometimes take them to someplace, too, to receive something when they get those results".

I got the email in the afternoon. The day I'm supposed to take the test in the capital is when I'll be given the diploma. They won't give it to anybody else. Like if I cared.

I won't do the test anyway. I won't apply for the master. I'll apply next year.

Catherine will do her trip. She would be gone and not be able to come with me. That's the last city we haven't gone to.

She had planned several times to change her schedule. She wants to return sooner. It's the best. Her birthday she will spend it alone. She has meetings and interviews of job she has all the procedures and paperwork for the certifications and license. Going in a trip this time of year is foolish thing to do. They didn't took account of her.

I feel irritated still. I am angry. Is it with Monica or Catherine's mom?

It's not sorrow I've been feeling. It's ire.

Rene told me he could help me in any regard, maybe they said a psychiatrist as an umbrella term. I should confirm anyway. They might have a doctor which deals with us "of my situation".

He has given me certain comments that I've noticed. "He might help you in that or another treatment". "Maybe he's a specialist who can treat you in a different manner."

Is he trying to get rid of me? Will he back out?

I'm doing it again. I can almost see the paranoia in this words. I look for obstacles outside, because they're easier to deal with than to accept that I'm scared.

I called when I got home. I called and the line was busy. I waited and my hands trembled. I called again and I got an answer.

There was a lady but it was not the same one. I reminded her of my appointment, the doctor and the treatment. I asked about the referral which is needed.

She asked me to wait and got up. A new voice came. It was calmer, nicer. She confirmed that I need an evaluation but there is no dr, I can choose whomever I want. I asked if my usual therapist, whose not a psychiatrist but a psychologist and a medical doctor could do and she said yes. I asked about the place and she confirmed it.

I said good bye and we hung up.


I feel the urge to get up and tell my dad. Talk with him. Why is it rage that I feel instead of fear?

Will it be easier to talk about if I'm angry instead of scared?

Would it be easier to scream it than confess it in tears?

### 2016-01-15

"I have sad eyes, expressive ones. My eyes tattle me, they betray me. Will I get to the point to want to take them out?"

Why did I started again to pass the journal? I could just empty and clean the logs in an electronic file. It would be cleaner and more organized. What point is there to write it in sheets of paper with my own hand and ink?

I remember how I passed the other ones. I would read the conversations with Monica, the fights, the arguments. I'd feel the feelings all over again. Like if writing them down it would be like getting the pin inside the bottle of ink and filling it up. Except there is no pen and there is no bottle of ink, I touch those memories and emotions and the sadness and misery crawl from the pages through my fingers all the way to me.

Is this the same way? I've just passed two or three days.

I just returned from Portugal. Consuela stands in my door-frame nervous and with something to confess. I think if she has feelings for me and that would made me feel double stupid. I am a slob who doesn't do his chores. I start showing the first symptoms. I'm filled of guilt and turn off all the lights. I start to drink. The irritability shows with Catherine. I finish bottles of wine and ask for entire litters for myself.

I woke up late today. I ate a lot. No, I did not. I ate normally. Why does it feel that way? I heated some soup and fried two eggs. Late in the afternoon my mother brought me a sandwich. That's it.

Why am I nervous? It's the weekend. I should rest or do something. I should do laundry or get out. It's the half of the month. I have a trip to pick up my award next month.

I should look for jobs, send my resume and go to interviews. Why am I scared?

I made my choice. I'll stay.

I woke up and sent a birthday message to Hilda. Did I dream something or the thought of telling her just spontaneously appeared on my mind? I should be thinking about telling my parents, not other people.

I had thought about sending her the pictures in which she appears. I thought about opening up to Melissa, too. She might be working with Ahmed now. Almost everyone I can think of has a job now. Do I feel pressure? Is that what this feeling is?

"Why do you need to find a job?" Catherine's mom asked her.

Why do I? It's what I am supposed to do. It's what I need to do.

I have to dress formally to the trip to Tecate. Even that is something to which I need to disguise myself.

Rene told me I might need to go to a psychiatrist for my evaluation. I am fulfilling all the requirements. To him I could had done the appointment in Sofia's name. Wear a dress and used that feminine voice in the phone. Maybe I could just present myself that way to him or her secretary. Going to the first interview and telling him why I go there. Would I treat it as some kind of test? See if anybody notices?

No, I'd be asked my motive of consultation. I would need to state that I'm going for an evaluation to go to an endocrinologist.

I don't need to. I can ask Rene for his letter. He said it nonchalantly in the middle of different ideas. He could help me with that. He could do it.

I can't fear that he won't now. What do I fear now? To what can I get nervous?

The place where I sent my resume answered that they would arrange the interviews this next week. I haven't sent to any other place.

I have to take the pictures and get the papers ready. Luis will have his birthday in two weeks. I have his presents. Catherine will leave in those days around. I have hers, too.

Then, when she returns I can go to Tecate to pick that useless award.

I fantasize about selling myself, being this proud and confident man who gains their attention in the interview. I'm none of those things.

Where else can I send a resume?

What am I expecting, waiting?

Is these emotions the result of the tangled words I keep hidden inside? Will they vanish when I tell my dad?

I won't have to see him until nights, I can hide in my room.

Maybe I won't be ever able to see him again.

I'll take his son away.

He is already dead. I'm just in his place, living his life.

And again I write the same nonsense all over again, as if romanticizing my cowardliness makes it better.



### 2016-01-16

"Mum, is it hard to take lipstick off?"
"If you tell me you're asking me because you're going to put it on, I'll slap you across the face"

Luis woke me up when he couldn't ignite the stove in the morning. At first I thought he was Miguel making himself breakfast. I didn't get up. I stayed there, lying, exhausted, dead.

A couple hours later somebody entered my room. I heard the sound of the door opening and it was like if I could had heard the light enter with him and extend its arm too to shake me from the covers. "Are you going to go to the United States?" One of them asked.

I doubted. I really considered it, let the idea move inside my mind like a sip of wine to grasp its true flavor before swallowing it.

"No, I think I won't." I turned and closed my eyes again. My mother had said if they were going they should be leaving the house around 8 in the morning.

I woke up again later. I wondered about getting up. Yesterday I rose after noon. It was more than a hundred minutes after midday.

"Did you sleep late yesterday?" my father would ask me later in Target. "Honestly, I can't remember".

I shake the weightiness and took my pill. I exited and saw "my mother's men" in the living room. They were waiting. No. Miguel wasn't there. I asked my father if they would not go. Yes, my mother was getting ready. I returned and grabbed the first items of clothes I saw in my closet. I moved some of the underwear closer to the drawer and picked one from the back. I climbed the stairs and say my mother brushing her hair.

"Aren't there any towels left?" "If you can't see any in there, no... That one is clean-ish"

I got in the bathroom with the damp towel and saw my own reflection. My long, curly and messy hair, the black strings growing from my face, my eyes heavy and full of something. I passed my fingers through the wires in my neck and grabbed the shaving machine. I was in a hurry but I had to do it. Shaving was not an option, but I wouldn't leave the house like this. I showered in less than 5 minutes. I could hear their voices in my head. My mother asking my father if I'd go. Why did I said no earlier, why until now.

I put my clothes on and tamed my hair. I wasn't even going to brush my teeth. I did and Miguel and Luis did also after seeing me.

What happened?

When did I start feeling bad? I took the pill. Before leaving I decided to start with the double dosage. I counted the pills and measured the days they'd last. No, I counted until this tuesday. I have to buy more. I have the money. Will I pay them myself or will I ask my father?

It's a way of opening the theme. "Dad, I need to buy more antidepressants." Would I leave it there? Am I trying to just wait for his answer? Stay passive expecting him to follow up? "Are you still going to take them? Do you know until when?" Or will I take the initiative for once? "I didn't tell you why I'm really taking them, right? ...right. I am nervous about my future. Getting a job, a career. And it's not just that. I don't like my body. I don't like being a man. It literally hurts me looking like this. Being seen like this. Dad, I am trans."

Why do I feel to urge to type "I am sorry?" Why should I be sorry? It's not my fault. It's not my choice or something that happened because I messed up. It's not a consequence or a misshapen. Would I apologize for being gay?

O can see it now, imagine it now. But I can't really see it.

I did talk about the master and the postulation. "There's no point in applying if you won't have your license."

"Ivan, did you grab some underwear?" "No" "Go and choose some boxers"

I don't wear boxers. I do need underwear but I won't buy it with you. I won't choose them with you nor make you pay for them.

It's not my mother whom I want to tell.

Not even with Luis.

I change the information in my own contact in my phone. I saw the picture and felt pathetic. Am I getting used to being this person again?

I went to the optic. The optometrician didn't ask about contact lenses. My mother got in first. When it was my turn it was like routine. "Have you picked a frame you liked?" No. I did look this time. I had time, I wandered. I wasn't limited by their guidance "these are men's". I looked everywhere but none I liked. Even after, when it was the time to pick, I couldn't. I literally couldn't see myself in the reflection. Was it because of my sight or my mind?

I picked the most similar to these ones. Will they be okay? Will I be okay?

Why don't I feel okay?

What is it that I lack? What do I need?

Do I need their support or is it something to be nervous in which unload my anxiousness?

### 2016-01-17

"You are a woman" "So?"
"I've already seen that picture, you're with Catherine in front of a mirror looking at the camera and making a duckface"

Does he listen? Did he really see?

What happens in the mornings? What is it that keeps me down? I told Catherine about the feeling I identified. I looked at the picture. No. Chevo started following her in Twitter. He might notice the posts she makes, has made. He might see my own account and my picture. "Do I look fine in the profile picture?" I asked her once again. Yes, of course she thinks I do. She asked for that photo. Why does it make me uncomfortable. Why do I fear people will look at it and see it... how? Weird? Sick? Pathetic?

Because people know me, know Ivan. They will see Ivan with lipstick. They will see the person they have known all this time with his face painted up in a ridiculous smile and big shinny eyes. It doesn't fit.

Strangers see what I show them. Known people see what they are accustomed to.

Today I couldn't wake up. I did but it was so hard. I heard my dad and the rustling of the paper bags. I heard the door, his footsteps. I did get up, I did wake up and rise. I got up from bed and ate. But I returned. I came back and got inside again and covered myself and hide.

Was there a conversation? Why do I feel so alone today? I have talked with Catherine. She asked me, no, I asked her if we would go tomorrow to take our pictures. I'll have to wear a shirt and tie and a coat. I'll have to tie my hair and look masculine. Dress sharply, be normal. Look normal.

That's how I've been looking all this time. Maybe that's what is making me sick.

I am almost out of pills. I have to buy more. Yesterday I wrote I could tell my dad. I will need his money. There will be more than 300 pesos from the pictures. Then will be another 200 for the medication. I should separate the money I'll need for the dr. It's months from now. There is time.

Would I prefer it being tomorrow or in a year?

Am I scared? Why don't I know anymore how I feel?

Rene will be the one who'll make the evaluation. Am I feeling sick on purpose? Will I hide it from him so I can get what I want? ...what I need.

I'm not so bad. I showered today. I put apart my clothes to wash them. I shaved my torso and underarms and legs. I cut myself accidentally with the razor and remembered the burn on the smooth legs. It hurts and yet it feels so good. I look at them and see them almost the same. It's like I can't really find the difference. And yet, inside my head, how I feel, it's worlds apart, night and day, black and white.

I didn't shave my face. Maybe tomorrow. I will have to wake up early and be ready in the morning. I should pick the clothes now and print the paper with my grades and the notes from the Test. I should look for my birth certificate and school diploma.

"Ok, Jose, so they call you Ivan, right?"

No, they don't... No, actually yes, they do, most do. Homer was one of the first people to call me Jose. He is the last one who did when he congratulate me for my birthday. Carolina, too, was one of the people who preferred that name. I remember saying it together. Jose Ivan. Jose-Ivan, like a sopa opera. People liked it, several commented how they at first thought it was a single name. 'How do you prefer being called?' 'Which one you like best?'. Until high school I never cared. I thought it was because I liked both. I don't care. Call me Jose or Ivan, or Jose Ivan, or whatever. In high school I started getting interested in names. No, a couple of months before. Entering was when I got my firsts nicknames. Flash, cauliflower, cauliflash, little simba. I didn't hate them nor liked them. They were nicknames. They were like being called Ivan or Jose or whatever. I realized I didn't like my name, I just didn't care.
Then, the next semester came Chad. I actually was called chad and Corbin. I hated those, and with time, tolerated.
After that I came to appreciate being called Ivan. Now, most people called me that way. All but a handful of people. The ones who know me more. The ones who know. They use this other name that not even my parents know. Sometimes even my therapist messes them up. Sofia, Ivan, Sofia. He, she, him, her... I can't blame him, nor anyone. Even I needed months to get used to the idea. Even now I don't really know how I refer usually to myself. But yes, you can call me Ivan. You and everybody else

for now, I guess.

### 2016-01-18

"Ivan, the technician will come at 10 or 11, can you wait for him?"

I am angry, I am sad. I am furious and tired. I'm heavy and hideous. I am pathetic and weak. I am depressed again.

I took the pill, I just have one left. I have no energy at all. I am irritable and down. I don't want to talk to anyone. I don't want to do anything. The washing machine is fixed and even thinking about standing up for my clothes is tiring. Last year I'd be checking over and over waiting for the clock to reach 0 and being the one to move it without anyone seeing it. I don't give a shit. I don't care if Luis or Miguel or my mom see the underwear between my sleeping clothes.

I just want to finish these words, change and go to sleep.


I was going to take the pictures and do the procedure for the certificate. I was supposed to wake up at 9 and start to get ready. My dad would call today. "I don't think they'll go that same day". He called the house and I didn't answer. He called directly to my phone and told me the news. Could I wait for the guy?

Last time I entered the shower and he came just as I was shaving. I had to be looking for the door. Open it up for him. Be attentive. I told Catherine and move the alarm an hour later. I moved but couldn't go back to sleep. I've been feeling off since then. I took the pill but it's been as if it got stuck in my fingers and I swallowed air.

Are these feeling something that can't be cured by the antidepressants? Are those the ones who have stopped working? Am I broken again?

I waited and time caught up. It was 11 and a half when I sent a text message to my dad. Would he really come? I was expecting to go to the university before lunch and today because tomorrow will be the auction for the classes.

He called me right back and asked me about it. I told him that. He might have noticed my voice. The one of it, the feeling under it. He said I should shower and get ready. If I left he would call him and tell him to come later in the evening. I should go.

I did. I got ready and my dad called me again when I was shaving. He'd come in 10 minutes. Could I wait that? I did and he came.

I was ready. He came and went. Less than 10 minutes. "Again? Last time it was the same thing, right? It's the second, and this happens very rarely, how curious" I raised my shoulders and he just smiled. He meant nothing behind that. Chit chat. His name was Ivan. Another time I would had introduced myself and maybe we might had a chat about the coincidence. Today I just extended my hand to meet his. I was not in the mood. I don't want to be Ivan anymore. I don't want to meet anybody nor say my name.

Even shorter than his stay here was the time I had to wait for Catherine to arrive. We drove to her session. I waited in the waiting room. The door was locked when we arrived. She followed our advice and changed the layout of her consult office.

She did take her pictures before coming my way. Midway there I realized I forgot my tie. I felt this huge feeling of... failure. It was as if I had forgotten my pants or my wallet. A terrible unfixable mistake. Nothing to be done. Deserving of punishment and shame. It was ridiculous.

I waited there. Catherine stepped in a couple of minutes after her meeting time. A quarter of an hour. We thought we heard the voice of Hilda but it wasn't. It was that same girl from the other time. She got her time back. Liliana gave it to her from the next session without realizing, I was there when her next patient arrived and sat besides me.

"You are from psychology, too, right?" I tried to smile but gave up halfway. "Yes" "Did you passed the Test?"
Sure, next month I'll go to a ceremony to receive a prize because of my results, not like it matters anyway. "Yes", I said instead, "and you?" I continued waiting for him to tell me he didn't, or he barely did, and then said something so I'd learn he has a job anyway. "Yes, they all should calm down and get over it".

He went back to his phone and I continued in my tablet. 10 minutes later Catherine stepped out.

Her therapist tires me. I felt seen. She knows me, knows my name and who I am. Would she see through me? Would she see this huge shadow over me, that dark passenger that drove me all day?

I took the pictures after returning for the tie. Catherine did the procedure in school. I'll do it tomorrow before refilling my prescription and going for the glasses.

I have to do it. I have to get up. This week they're supposed to schedule a meeting for an interview. I see the post about that other job. They're looking now for interns, students. I feel exhasperated. First because I was a student, now because I am not one.

It doesn't matter. I have enough to do and worry to think about a stupid job.

### 2016-01-19

I'm wearing new glasses. I picked them up today. My father gave me the money yesterday. I paid them and the pills. I didn't ask him for that money. Did I lose that chance? Can I ask him anyway? It's not about the money, it's the excuse. Why do I need an excuse?

I should feel less embarrassed, ashamed. Why do I still feel this way?

I woke up like almost all the other days. My body heavy and my eyes tired. I opened them and it was just an hour before noon. I was dreaming. We were in some kind of park. I was thinking about the rides. It was just like when we were in Disneyland. Luis was there, and the rest of the family, too. Were Anahi and Catherine there? I know there was some kind of lake. Luis jumped there I worried about him. I dived deeper and deeper and I think I screamed. I wanted someone to take him out, save him. He doesn't know how to swim. He'd drown. Why didn't anybody do something? My father jumped too and swam straight for the boat. Did my mother jump, too?

In another dream Irving was there. We were in some kind of room with a window facing a big building. There was some kind of university party. Drinks and food and music. He was over me, like when people do push ups and have someone over them as extra weight. Why would he be over me? I'm not strong, I don't exercise, why would I show him anything?

I was paralyzed when I opened my eyes for an instant. In a blink I was fine.

Even waking up late I had more morning than which I knew what to do with.

I showered after I picked my clothes. I didn't even shave. Neither my body nor my face. I didn't put anything on my face. I just cleaned my hair and untangled it. I didn't even tie it before mousse. I put the red shirt over my tank. My shoulders were bare when I looked at myself in the mirror. My hair is really long now. It gets to my shoulders. It's not a ball nor big knot. It's normal long hair. I sent a picture of Catherine and she made a note about my chest. She liked it. She saw it, like a chest, with shadow and a subtle round form. I just saw the black little dots of hair.

Even my face had a mask of shadow over my chin and neck. I didn't care. Nobody would see me, anyway.

I was ready and I chatted with Catherine until the time I'd be ready to leave. The offices in the university close between one and three for lunch. Ten minutes after three was the perfect time to leave. I'd be leaving my papers, then stopping in the pharmacy for some smiles in a bottle and finally picking up the glasses near my house.

I planned the whole day and journey for less time and gas wasted. I had my bag with a folder containing a plastic cover with the pictures and the documents I'd need. I had my book, too. I pretended to read it as I waited.

In the university I formed in line as I expected. I waited as I had thought I would. It was slower than yesterday. I was lonelier. I had my book. But I just read until I got to the window. After I gave her my papers and had to wait for them to give them back I just stood there. I couldn't read anymore. At first I did seat in one of those chairs. I went all the way to the back. Why do we people look for a seat when we don't have to be near another person?

I remember once when we went to the movies in Spain. I and Raul sat in two seats. There was an old man behind us who actually asked us to move. "The whole theater is empty, why would you sit in front of me?"

I didn't last more than 3 minutes in that chair. I couldn't hear anything. They'd call my name and I had to pay attention. I moved all the way to the front and stood there.

"Fernandez", the lady called. I went there and she saw me. "Jose Fernandez?" she confirmed. Does she do that with everybody? It'd be something normal to do in that situation. Do I want to doubt? Is this time like the one in the gas station where I looked for it?

I didn't look like a woman. I dressed and acted and talked like a man. I looked and played the part. In the pharmacy I didn't speak a word when the woman selling baked sweets approached me and called me sir.

I waited in there. It was lonely, deserted. I sat in an empty table surrounded by nobody and drank my water. I read another chapter. This is the shortest book that has taken me this long to finish.

I should finish it already and start with another one. I actually started it over again from the beginning. Did I caught up again in a loop where I don't pay attention because I don't understand what's going on and I can't understand because I don't pay attention?

I have my glasses and I see clearer.

Can I see things clearer, too? Can I have a more realist perception of my future and situation now? Or will I just get accustomed to this new perspective and things will start to get blurred again?

### 2016-01-20

"You are a free and independent woman who is not anybody's property"

Today was an easier day. Yesterday I went to school. I exited the house. Maybe it's this house, this 4 walls who imprison me. Maybe it's being inside, hidden, covered. Yeah, that's what it is, staying inside out of everybody's sight. Ashamed. Why do I feel shame? What is it that embarrasses me?

Today my father asked me questions. We were alone in the living room. I was lying in the couch under a blanket and he was making himself dinner. I ate a sandwich in the afternoon and he was doing exactly that, too. He walk towards the end to the kitchen and asked me if I went out. The movement of my head answered him silently.

I just wrote how maybe being in this house is what maddens me, and yet, today that I feel alright is the day I didn't leave.

He asked again, in a different way. Will I do something tomorrow? I again moved my head but this time in another direction with a whole different meaning. "Where will you go?", "Therapy", I answered in one word. He stopped there. I stopped him. I could had gone on. I answered his first move with head movements and a one-word answer. I want to tell him the world and I can't even say a sentence.

There was something in the telly. Yeah, The Big Bang Theory. Sheldon was with Amy lying in the floor of a electronic department in a store. He was indecisive about buying an xbox or a play station.
My dad heard when the clerk of the store approached them to tell them the store had closed five minutes ago and the registers were closed, too.

He walked towards the tv with a huge smile on his face and started an anecdote with me as his only destination.

"When I was in the Netherlands, the [one day of the week, maybe thursdays but I really don't remember] they have this market outside where they sell all different kinds of things. So the stores and businesses from the city close around 2pm when they usually close at 6 or 7. A coworker was inside this music store browsing some discs. It was like one fifty-something. The owner of the store walked towards him and told him that he was going to close. "Yeah, I'm just looking", he answered back and kept what he was doing.

A couple minutes later the owner returned and grabbed him by the hand. "I'm closing now, thank you", he was saying as he escort him to the exit! He literally threw him out. "Back there they usually just close the door and wait until the ones inside leave. Here they literally close at 2pm" He finished and he was still smiling.

He returned to the kitchen and finished his sandwich.

What am I waiting for?

The more I wait, the more difficult it will be. The more I let time pass, the more things I have to tell, the more weight it will have.
The more time passes, though, the more liberating will it feel. The more relief my shoulders will have. When I told my mom I literally had excruciating back pain. Whenever I tell my dad will I be able to walk?


Tomorrow I'll see Catherine. "Will I go as a boy?" I asked her. When would I imagine that question would ever make sense in my life?

I don't know what will I wear. I have the two new shirts I bought the last time we went to San Ysidro. They are blue, a color I haven't used in a long time. A boyish color. And yet I plan to wear them with something feminine. I have this idea of dressing with something that I would not wear with my family around.

Do I do this because of Catherine? Is it for Rene? Maybe I want to dress like the last time, too. Look like a girl when I ask him to write a referral. Make it even harder for him to deny me, to tell me I'm not sure.

Why do I think of passive ways of telling people who I am?

Because I need to. I can't stand in front of the world, wearing man's clothes, looking like a man and tell them in a man's voice that I am not one.

It's as if I had to earned it. I have to fool everybody first. They have to be mistaken. Make them easier to accept I am one. Correct them in their own assumption.

"Is that person a woman?" "No, he is a man, he's called Ivan" "No, really?" "Actually no, I am not a boy, my name is Sofia" "See, it had to be".

Do I think about the world or myself when I make up that encounter? Maybe the real in-congruence lies between what I see and what I feel. That is whom I really want to convince?


### 2016-01-21

"I need my husband, can you get him?" "I can't." "I need to talk to my husband, and I need to hold my husband. Can you at least try?" "I'm sorry."

"Hello, girl, I'm from the school of Anthropology, would you help me buying a cookie?"
"Do you have a coin for something to eat, girls? Oh by the way, you both are really pretty."

"I get it, I can see it: I was a child and had it all repressed nicely and hidden. That's why I couldn't get in the girls' bathroom, even though I had my mother's permission and I knew nothing would happen to me, I couldn't because it was forbidden. It stayed that way until I reached puberty and it started to come out in my stories about a man killing a woman or a man meeting one and losing her forever. It wasn't until my teen years when it exploded and I couldn't deal with it anymore so I dived into a dark depressive episode.
Finally, it all resurfaced again in a moment of huge stress before leaving for another country. I can see it all, I know where it all came from and how it flourished. But how does that help me? I'm the same person I was when I didn't know"



I woke up earlier than I had thought I would. It was 6am precisely when I just opened my eyes. I escaped from a bad dream of a scene in an all-boys boarding school. A group of students were dressed in girls' uniforms and had wigs and make up. They were kissing each other when other group of boys turned on the lights and ran at them.

I got ready. I wore the leggings as Catherine proposed me. I liked the way the blue t shirt looked. I shaved my face and it looked fine. I applied make up and my face was normal. I liked it, I took a picture and sent it to Catherine. I got into my car. The neighbor from across the street saw me. He was washing his car when he looked up to catch me in his sight. I, like a little kid, pretended that if I didn't see him I'd turn invisible.

I parked my car in the parking lot next to my high school. I walked towards Rene's. I met a lot of sights. I saw people turned and inspect me. I noticed their eyes examining me. I saw the way the woman in the car turned to her copilot and laughed. I tried to hide in my own arms as I kept walking. I was lost in my own mind. I saw the green light and knew I could cross. When I gave my first step I heard his scream. I didn't even got to turn when he was already stopped. He apologized three times and I just mumbled a word in a borrowed voice. I kept walking. I entered the building as fast as I could. The mirrors tried to screamed my reflection at me but I ignored them.

Rene invited me in. I sat and didn't know how to start.

He saw me more flattened affectively. "I wonder if it is because of what you say of how you think you look or because of the steps you are taking towards a permanent change."

Both. It's the former and the latter, and that I can't find a job and that I haven't told my parents and that I feel lonely and a lot other things. It's everything.

He asked me a little about my clinical history. When did I start using the name of Sofia? That made me talk about my days in jr high when I looked for a name. Johann was the one I picked. Jayden was the one I hid and forgot.
"when you hear Jayden, do you think about a man or a woman?" I would ask Zuri.

He can't apply tests to me. They are biased. They are useless. How can he evaluate me? How could anyone? I know what to answer, I know what to say or see. Even with a psychiatrist, I would tell him what he'd expect to hear.

When he said those things, was in a hostile way? Was he attacking me or defensive? No... he just thought of using the tests from that moment. From when it all surfaced.

I didn't even looked for the MMPI-2 results.

Catherine met me outside. I accompanied her to pick up her letter. I waited outside the internet place. I was parked but I felt all the people and cars around me. I felt their presence and their sights.

We ate pizza in the beach. We stayed outside the park. We talked about things, about feelings. I can't remember the themes. I just remember seeing me in the mirror, looking hideous, closing it and escaping its screams. I tried to put make up again, but it made it worse. It was unfix-able. Moments later the hobo came to the window and complimented us.

We went to wal mart and saw things. We bought condoms and I found her mascara. I bought it.

After the movie we bought two planners. Like the one she had seen and one similar. I might try to fill it.

"I was furious when I read the posts asking for interns with a pay of 1000 pesos the week"
"Have you started your social service? Do you know of somebody looking for a place?"

I didn't remember. Yesterday Catherine invited me. "Would you come with me to the bathroom?" Any other day I would walk and wait outside. Did I extend my hand or did she grab mine? She was ahead of me. She opened the door and I entered behind her. It's not the first time I've gone in the ladies' room. It's not the first time we've gone together. I remember looking at the stalls expecting somebody to be inside, seeing me and reacting. Informing me I don't belong.

It's not that I think I don't. I think they won't believe it.

She told me outside her house when they were in wal mart. How the cashier talked to her dad. She was telling him about this man who tried to entered to the ladies' room. she informed "him" it was the women's. That person stated that she was a woman. "He was a man, his hair was short, he as tall, he had beard..." The person was irritated and showed her. "He had a crack, he showed me his line". The "man" dropped their pants to show her a vulva.

I thought about it. Does a vagina make somebody a woman? Is that were the line is drawn? People love making the statement about chromosomes. Nobody can see them, they're not visible. You don't see them as you see somebody's hair or eyes. They don't show through any clothes. Not even naked can you see them. I could grow breasts. Even men without hormones sometimes grow them. I grew my hair. There are women with shorter hair. I've worn women's clothes and called sir and little brother. It's not the hair nor the clothes.

You could grow a beard or breasts with the right medication. But people don't see transgender people as the gender they feel. "There are no such thing as a girl with a dick, just men with tits".

So it's the line in the genitals?

When Catherine told me that story, I thought about myself. How I wished I could do just that. I wish I could just lower my pants and tell the world. "No, look, I do belong here."

... I'm not an impostor.

I know I'm not faking. I know who I am. I just don't believe that I can convince anybody else.


I already gave the letter of Rene and my carnet of the hours. I've finished therapy. I've finished my 100 hours. That process is over. Now I actually am in therapy, though.

I looked and found the results of the MMPI. The gender scale is not the highest one. The first is Depression, followed by psychasthenia. The third is social isolation and finally there lies the gender one.

It all fits. A depressive episode with thoughts of death and suicide. High rates of guilt and anhedonia. Excessive rumiation of bad thoughts or ideas. Phobias and anxiety. Tendency to repression and disassociation, isolation from others, loneliness. A problem with the role of gender and the identity.

It all fits. He may use it for his evaluation. He could put the lousy intent of a test with the play-doh, too.

So I killed another one of the excuses of problems.

My mother and father left for the farewell party of her boss. Before leaving, my dad entered my room and asked about the graduation. The dates. He noted them down in his phone. When would I go to Tecate? That was the one he was interested in. Is he planning in accompanying me? He might go and see. Is it really that important? Is just a test. It's worthless. ...is it?

I could apply to a master in a foreign country. I might not find a job but I could defend myself for a place in a master somewhere.

Argentina is a perfect place for people "in, uh, my situation".

Is it really mocking when I repeat that phrase or is just negating that it hurt me? Did it? What is it that hurts me more, a direct insult or a trying to being nice? An insult I know their intent. I know to ignore it. I know to hate the person and just leave. But with those kind of things? She tried to be helpful. She looked for a euphemism to refrain from the idea of telling me I'm sick.

I'm looking for a specialist. Healthy people don't need medication.

I hate the perception I get from Chevo and Jessica of pity. Their dismissal of it as something to be rejected.

"I've told you already, that thing about your sexuality doesn't bother me at all, I don't care about it".

Why does it hurt me? Why does it make me uncomfortable?

My father asked me if I wanted to go to the United States yesterday after they arrived from the party.

Today I awoke in the morning. I turned and saw the phone. It was early. I was so tired. Exhausted. I had said that I would go, but my body was so heavy and my head so troubled that I doubted it. I kept my eyes closed and tried to go back to sleep. It was like ten in the morning when my father entered the room to asked me. I just opened my eyes and said yes.

"Will we go alone?" I asked him. He was ready. "No, they are getting ready". The bathroom was empty so I just grabbed my clothes and entered. I picked one of the panties that Catherine gave to me. They're small, I wondered if I could wear them all day. I had forgotten about them until now.

Panties. I hate that word. I always try to avoid it when writing. Underwear, underpants... Is it because of the feminine connotation or is the childishness? I don't say tummy, either. Maybe a little bit of both. I hated the word girl. "Girly" was an insult. Beside being feminine, it was being a child. The first repressed feeling I accepted, was the dread of wasting my childhood. Not being a child, not playing, not enjoying myself.

Maybe I got it confused. I never got into being a boy because I didn't feel like one. ...
This kind of phrases irritate me. I hate to fall in that same narrative of being something I'm not. I'm not somebody trapped anywhere. Neither god nor anyone made a mistake.

Nobody will read this. Who do I want to convince?

Even now it feels uncomfortable admitting I was or wanted to be a girl. A small girl, a child, a kid.

"I had the nicest dream. I was a baby and my mother held me in her arms. She saw me and smiled and called me Lili"

That was the lamest and cheesiest line of all the movie. At least that way I felt it in the beginning. I can't accept it in myself.

Since the beginning I told Catherine, reassured her that I would not ask my parents to see me in a different way. To call me by a different name or pronouns. I would never ask them to be their daughter.

I imagined and fantasize and practice how I'd tell my dad, what I have to tell my mother still. Neither of those time do I even think about saying the name. About asking them anything. I can, I have, asked my father for money for the antidepressants. I don't mind asking my mother for money to pay for my psychotherapy sessions.

...but this? I wouldn't. I feel as if I were asking them for the resources to kill their son.

Their son doesn't exist. He won't die because he didn't lived. I won't say the same shit about a mask or that nonsense. I am their son, I am their Ivan. I was...

Ivan was dead. Ivan has always been dead. He was a living corpse who felt nothing. He was lifeless. I was never happy, I didn't enjoy anything. This is my chance of happiness. This is my path to living. I'd love their support... I can't write that I don't need it.

I won't die without it. I'll find a way.

I bought a purple sweater. My mother stayed in the car when we entered Target. I separated this time. I wandered among the aisles. Men's clothes, women's, purses, shoes... I watched, looked for nothing. Why didn't I just looked?

I feel I don't belong. I took two pills and yet the feeling didn't go away.

It's not that "I am not a woman". Or it is but not the only thing.

I worry about how I look. About how would people think. What if my father or brothers saw me. Luis looks at me, he notices.

He has asked. Why, if I want to tell him, do I fear his asking?

I asked Catherine about what could I look for. She answered that a blouse but I couldn't. I didn't. Luis bought his gift for his birthday.

I fell asleep when they went to Pizza Hut. I was dreaming something when Luis opened the door and woke me.

It was a peculiar feeling. I felt alive, awake, I was doing something, thinking about something, being somewhere. And then the impulse, a bolt of energy that brought me to reality. I opened my eyes and saw the world. That instant of disorientation, of not knowing. Not knowing where I am, what am I doing, what am I thinking , who am I...

I love that instant. In that instant I don't worry, nor I fear, nor I suffer. In that instant I don't am.

There are no quotes today. I've done nothing important at all.

I tried watching that Steven Universe cartoon yesterday at night. I remember lying in bed earlier. Opening the tablet and searching where I could watch it. The tablet turned itself off a couple of times and I gave up. Did I read?

I haven't finished that book. Is that another symptom of depression? I remember not being able to finish books, like the one from Granada and even a couple from a Song of Ice and Fire. I didn't even finish the second from the lord of the rings.

It's less than 250 pages and I'm barely after the middle.

I fell asleep and dreamed. I dreamed a lot. I remember very little from them. One I was in a bedroom. There a house of some kind but I can just recall images and scenery. There was a talk about a Toy Story movie. Some woman asked us for an interpretation, or did we asked her? I remember some phrase about identity and body perception. The second dream was in a university. It had certain connection with a past dream or a false memory. A certain kind of mission? A bomb? No, there was a student whom I had to follow. I would follow him because I knew he already was guilty. I knew where to go and at what to look.

Was it time travel? Alternate universes? I grabbed myself from another, a past one. I was different. I was me, a little younger. I looked completely like a woman, the other me did. She had long hair and a hat. There a little piece of metal in her eye, like a ring that was under the eyelid. I remember thinking how I couldn't even bear contact lenses and that version of me had jewelry in the eye.

She talked and people saw her as a woman. Nobody doubted it. Somebody asked for a name and I could notice the hesitation before speaking. The intention of saying Ivan. "Jessica", came out instead.

It was weird. Why that name? I didn't think of Chevo's Jessica. I thought about that childhood friend. The face. Now that I try to remember, I can see some of her in that face.

I can't remember much after that. There was another dream. It was like a videogame, there were guns and people. Shooting, it was some kind of neighborhood. I was scared, nervous. I feared of being hit, hurt. I woke up.

I was awake when I heard the sound of the door opening and closing. I knew it was my father and I knew he was leaving. I closed my eyes again and dreamed. The second time the door opened I heard it again. This time I payed attention for that familiar noise the paper bags make. I rose easily and ate.

I was so tired I didn't even think about it. It was automatic. I went back and turned off the lights. I slept until afternoon.

I've done nothing since then. I've seen some episodes of that kid's show. I feared I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. I feel tired, though. I started the words earlier so I can go to bed. I don't want to do anything.

I can see some of those symptoms in myself. I upped the dosage, maybe it's my body getting used to it again. I didn't forget.

Catherine has aches. That little, something in her back. Maybe tomorrow she will go to the doctor and get it checked.

Luis bought a game yesterday. Hyrule warriors. In there you can choose the player. There are Link and another characters. He chose a female one. "Why do you keep choosing girls?" He said he had to in that stage.

Today, he proposed I could buy him and Xbox one and he'd buy assassin's creed. In that game we could both play at the same time. He wanted to use certain character. A little later he corrected himself and said the other name. The woman. I thought about it. I use Lucina in super smash bros. He started choosing Robin. He uses a lot of others but he picked her lately. There is Splatoon where he picked the girl first. Then, Xenoblade where his character is a woman. He started making some comments about his weight. He's a teenager and in time of changes. But I'm scared.

What if it's not an irrational fear? What if he feels the same way I do?

I'd be lying if I say the reason that scares me is because of how much I am suffering and I wouldn't want him to go through the same.

I don't, but that's not the only reason. I am scared of what people would say or think. Two freaks in the same family. It must be my parents fault. It must be my own. He's confused and imitated me. I caused it. Maybe he noticed and wanted to be like me.

I was his role model.

He hasn't make any comments or other actions. A lot of people use female characters. I might be just looking for other thing to be scared or nervous about. It might be another symptom.

Is that another reason to be scared of telling him about me?

Hay dias donde no soporto el dolor de la soledad.

More than a hundred days I've been writing in english. I feel no energy to narrate this days. I know I dreamed something today. It's gone from my memories. I showered today and shaved. I changed my stinky clothes. I try to look presentable.

Yesterday Catherine fell asleep in the night. I looked some job offerings in that page. Why do I keep doing that? I won't send anything. I won't try. Yesterday I actually fooled me. I thought I would. I considered positions and looked for possibilities. I was enraged when I realized that more than half of those were looking for a female postulate. I saved a job offering. It wasn't specific to my profile. It was done with a high school graduate in mind. Patient and family attention. With my experience in the hospital I actually had a chance.

I saved it. I considered sending a curriculum right there. Just apply and wait. It was already today. 1, maybe, 2... In the morning it would be a right time. I just had to sleep, wait a little.

Morning came and I didn't wake up. I died again. I'm dead. I opened my eyes and rose but I'm not awake. I'm still numb, senseless. Floating lifeless in the routine. I didn't send a thing. Why? It's worthless. I have things to do. I have to go to Tecate and have the rehearsal of the ceremony and then all the procedure for the license.

Deep within I don't fool myself. I know it's fear what stops me. I am scared. I am scared of applying and being rejected. I'm scared of being hired and failing. I'm scared of getting the job and actually being good at it and growing up and getting old and dying.

I am scared. I am petrified with fear. I want to crawl to bed and lie there until night comes and the day never rises.

Am I scared of the doctor? Why do I want it to come then? Why do I want it to be now? Why do I want to see him and have an answer now? Having the prescription and going to the pharmacy and seeing the reaction of the clerk. His confusion or his stupid questions. Maybe there would be some remarks. That don't scare me. Having the pill in my hands and thinking about taking it. Thinking about its permanency and its effects, its consequences. Do those scare me?

I'd take them. I'd take them now and looked for me in the mirror. I'm scared of my own psyche I'm scared of what Rene could write. What if this stupid passenger ruins it for me? What if I have to cancel it because of this feelings? What if they are really fear and doubt? What if its nobody's fault but mine?

I won't tell Luis. I won't tell my Dad. They'll find out on their own. Somebody will find something, or a word will escape from my mouth and hide in their attention. I might tell Paola. Maybe. I'm still fool enough to think of me capable of that.

I know I won't add Eusebio or Paola on Twitter. I know I won't reach out for any of them.

Because I'm depressed, because I'm sad and now there is a big and dark cloud of bad thinking fogging my perception. There are a lot of bad decisions whispering in my ears.

I need help, and now that I need it the most is the hardest for me to reach out and ask it.

Catherine is sick. She went to the doctor today. She has a little abscess in her lower back. She is in pain.

I thought about her death. She won't die. I mean, she will, we all will. But there is no reason for thinking she will any time soon. Nonetheless that thought has crawled into my mind and grasped himself to the walls. What if she dies? What if she leaves. What will happen when she's gone?

I will be really lonely. I won't have a lover. I won't have anyone to find me attractive. Anyone to really see me as who I am.

I won't have nobody to talk to. I won't have anyone who would listen or understand.

I won't have a friend to confide in. I would be lonely. I would stop existing. I'd be him again or just a freak.

Am I that to the world?

Or am I that to myself when Catherine is not here to change my mind?

### 2016-01-26

"I hate you. I hate you so much I could resuscitate you from fear"

I was in my bed. The room was black and dark. I had the night inside my bedroom. I talked to the silence as if she could listen to me.

"I never asked you for your love. I never asked you to support me. I asked you for your friendship, I asked you that you wouldn't leave. You promised me the ocean, the sea. I asked for a sip of water. I died from thirst."

I will never be free until I let her go. She left months ago. She lives her life and I still resent her. I still count her as one of my best friends in life and hurt her absence. The space that she left empty is only empty if I save it for her.


I stayed in bed again. This time it was different. I woke up early in the dawn. I had anxiety. I felt this tumult of energy flowing inside of me, urging me to move, to get up and run, to escape. I turned and couldn't keep my eyes closed. The feeling passed in some minutes and I fell asleep again.

I remember hearing the voices of the morning leaving for school. I stayed in bed. Noon was the time I got up.

I took two pills from the bottle and started the day.

Start the day. What does that mean? I write so much about the difference of living and just drifting lifeless. I see no difference in me now. I "live" for what? What is it that I do? What did I do today after I exited my room.

I took the pills that give me life and I spent it doing nothing. I felt a little better but I did nothing. Should I do something? I feel this need of what should be. Like a failed potential. Maybe they're just expectations that I'm not fulfilling.

I am burdened by both the emptiness of time and its pressure.

The pressure of living sucks the life out of me.

"I'm in that stage where I feel weird when some people call me sir while others call me son or buddy"

Gustavo posted that on Facebook. I read it and felt this strange sensation inside me.

"Ã‚Â¿What did you think when you saw it?", Catherine asked me. "Bitch, please".

Some people call me sir and others call me lady.

Yesterday night I thought about telling someone. Anyone. Hilda, Melissa, even Johanna.

I have to tell my dad. I could tell Paola. What's the point in deflecting? The date comes closer.

"Dad, I have an appointment with a doctor..."

I could be blunter: "Dad, I made an appointment with an endocrinologist"

No, that would freak him out. I could tell him I'll make some tests because "of my situation"? That would have some funny reference. "I will go take some bloodwork because of my depression". Maybe I have this hormone imbalance that could worse things with me. I wouldn't be lying. I would be telling the truth in disguise.

I could be direct and honest first. Tell him as I've thought: "Dad, I've never talked with you about my depression. I've felt it most of my life in some way or another, but it really affected me since high school. It has some biological reasons, factors, but it is related to some other things. For instance, I've always felt lonely or had this difficulty with relating to people. I don't like my body either. Everything is connected. I don't like my body, I feel sad, I feel lonely. One affects the other, and the other and the first one. Like a chain...."

I could give a speech talking a lot. Walking around the border in a dry swimsuit instead of jumping. Then, when I've already tired myself. I could touch the water with my foot hoping to slip and fall: "I don't like my body because I don't like being a man."

I could just run and jump. "Dad, I am trans." Fuck him, fuck me, fuck everything. I would say it and deal with it later.

I'm scared I'll get so full with rage with myself that I'd end up doing that. Hitting him with the news. Provoking him with reality so he'd hit me back.

"Dad, remember sense8? The transgender woman.... I am like that. I am sorry, but I am like that."

Will I spent the next weeks until my appointment writing that sentences here instead of opening up to him?

"Mom, could you tell my dad I am trans?" Or will I end doing that?

### 2016-01-27

"Did he see me? That one time, months ago, in the movie theater. Did he see me? Did he ask you something? Have you told anyone?"

I found her ghost again in the darkness of my room. I thought about asking her. Her ghost is mute. Is a silent mocker who just smiles. I considered looking her up. How would it be talking to her again? Why do I keep thinking that? I threw the thought at her and hoped that it would make her disappear.

I won't look for her. I won't open to her. There is no point nor use. I have no use for any answer she could give me. I deflect, I ask about him but in real I just want to know how she saw me. She recognized me and smiled. That's the information I have. That should be it. So what if I looked ridiculous? So what if I looked like a woman and it freaked her out? So what if she liked it?

What difference would it make if he didn't see me or he did but didn't recognize me, or he did and did and asked her, or mocked me.

They live their life, I should fight for mine. I am not in hers and she won't be in mine.

"I hate you, like nobody in this world will hate you. I hate you, as nobody in this world can be hated. I hate you because you always are still there. I hate you so much I could make you resuscitate."

I have that song stuck in my head. I played it on repeat yesterday several times. I keep repeating it today. Is the thought of her that is stuck in my head? I feel like a betrayal to Catherine the emotions I still feel for Monica. Even if those are hate.

Why can't I let her go? Why do I keep her tied to me?

Even if she stays here hated, I am not alone. Letting her go is her really leaving. Is another loss. No, I haven't lost her yet. It's what I keep saying and telling myself. She left me but I keep her ghost with me. I am the one who calls for her. I am the one who hates her and thinks of her. I am the one who unfollows her and then looks for her news. I am the one who can't stand the idea of losing anybody.

Her leaving should prepare me for the rest of the people who won't understand. All the other "loved ones" who will leave and judge and hate.

Maybe I am scared of the hormones, of the change. I am terrified of looking for a job, and even if I can't admit it, I am afraid of going to the capital. I am afraid of starting the process of changing my name. Introducing myself, not as a woman, but as Sofia. Correcting my parents when they call me as Ivan, as their son.

Making them mistaken. Is their mistake making me this way? Is it mine, growing like this?

I felt anxiety when Catherine told me I and Anahi could go see Paola when she's in Zacatecas. It would mean telling her about me without Catherine by my side. It would mean telling her sooner than I thought.

I will tell her about the name. I will tell her everything and then I'll tell the other ones.

I saw Catherine today. I went to her house. I put on the purple sweater I had bought. At first I was wearing the jeggings. She asked me was I was wearing and I noted how worried she was. I changed and left. I shaved in the shower, I painted my face. I did shadowed with red my lips and then cleaned them after. When I put mousse on my hair. I was going to tie it but changed my mind. I grabbed a couple of bobby pins and styled it in a new way.

"From the window, as you stepped out of the car you did look very girly".

Her uncle was in the garage and was the first person to see me. Did he recognize me? She opened the door next. Her mother saw me after. She asked if I had something on my lips. From the window my face looked full of make up.

I just hid my beard and put that clear gel on my lashes.

We saw inside out and an episode of Jessica Jones. Her mother made squash with corn.

Tomorrow I'll see RenÃƒÂ© and take the mmpi results to him.

Of what could I talk?

### 2016-01-28

"I thought about leaving therapy, talk about that with Lilli. How would she charge me if I return and that stuff."

Why did that upset me?

I exited therapy in a fine mood. I was alright. I was fine before we started talking.

"Are you going out tomorrow?" My father asked me. He sent me a text message if I wanted something from the Carl's Jr mid-session. I didn't see it until after stepping out of the room. My phone was all out of credit and the message didn't send. I went to the oxxo and gave all my money. When the message did send, my father answered me back he had already bought the chicken pieces. That's what my mother brought me yesterday.

I didn't say anything. It didn't matter. Whatever, I liked them. It was a disappointment, though.

Luis won't go to school tomorrow. It doesn't matter either. My father told me I could just leave after I make him breakfast. At his age I didn't stay home alone. It wasn't until a year later when I started.

I was 13 years old, I was in jr high. It wasn't the first time I stayed here that I did it. I remember thinking about it. I resisted. The idea came up since the prefects came to the classroom and gave us those little papers. I had the temptation. I thought about it, dreamed about it. I tried to avoid it as much as I could. Then I just entered my father's room and entered their closet.

I remember the shame, the reflection and seeing me myself. I wish I could forget that. It's not the same as looking me now. Now it might still be a secret but it's not forbidden. There is no guilt. I guess.

What does it mean that Catherine stops going to therapy. What would Lilliana say to her. She won't deny her leave. She hasn't change a little thing from the relationship with her parents. Her father still doesn't know. Neither about her nor me.

But I can't pressure her. I can't ask her to say anything because I haven't either.

My father was alone today when my mother went to her course. Miguel was in here and Luis in his room. My father was available in his. I have to tell him. I have to say it now. I can't keep it inside anymore. It's burning me, it's poisoning me.

I fantasized about blowing my brains out when I was in Spain. I put my fingers in my temple and closed my eyes. They were a loaded pistol. I could feel their cold and steel point. I awaited the bullet that would never come.

I would lie if I say that I have no thoughts like that anymore. There is no gun now, I don't make my fingers into anything.

I feel a cold blade. It's razor sharp and its cut is barely felt. My throat opens and warm blood spills. Would my secret come out finally? Could I finally talk?

I sound sick. If Rene could read this he might worry again. He might ask to see me more frequently again.

My father now knows that I have the letter of therapy. He hasn't asked me when will I stop going like Catherine's. I await for that. I hope he will come and questions me. "How more sessions will you go?" or "Why do you still need to therapy?" Something like that which gives me an opening and I could answer back.

"I haven't finish with my therapy. I need it now most than ever. It's stressing me out not having a job. Being ignored or denied. That besides my depression and my body..." I would take it out and expect him to see it, notice it and say something.

"Yeah, I don't like my body. I don't like being a man."

Would that be enough? Or do I just want to say the least necessary?

Will I tell him I am not a man. Will I mention the clothes or the name? Will I ever?

Lilly has a job and a new offer. Beatriz can't go tomorrow because she has a job. A couple of days ago, Elena posted a picture of herself with a corporation polo, titled "me at my job".

I don't know how they do it. I don't know how they can.

They have experience, they are women.

"What are you doing?" "I just want to see when you finish... I'm counting the number of words"
"Leave, I don't want to play chess"

I could had let him stay. He could had read about my body, my father. He doesn't understand much of english but he could know.

I threw him out instead. Because it makes me uncomfortable to be open, to be vulnerable and being read. I want him to know, I want all of them to know but I throw them out.

### 2016-01-29

"And for the lady?"

What is it with those comments that lift my mood for the rest of the day?

I have a headache. It's pulsing like a second heart inside my temples. I put the same song of these latest days. I shared it with Catherine. Monica's name came up again.

"Two people are in front of you: one who loves you and one whom you love. You are given the choice of hugging just one. Which would you pick?"

"What would you do?" she asked me.

"None".

It happened. An afterimage of the memory comes to my eyes. Like an old projector which starts humming and show it. A mute and color-less movie. Catherine and me sitting in Argana's pillows. Monica and me sitting in the dark seats of my car. I had that choice. I had to choose. One whom you love and one who loves you. Catherine loved me and I loved Monica. I was tempted by those new sensations and urges, I liked being loved and needed and wanted. But I was afraid of leaving normality. I wanted that routine back, the security of the known.

It was an impossible choice so I backed up. None. I would stop with both. I'd escape and leave. I ended up going after both.

Times have changed. I have changed.

I love Catherine and she loves me. Monica... she's gone. No, her phantom's here. Do I have a phantom with her? Is she haunted by me old persona's memory? The one whom I stopped being. Just like the Monica she wasn't anymore.

Who cares? What does it matter?

My mother woke me up in the early morning. She brushed her teeth and vomited. Her screeches came in a stampede towards my room. They entered through the opened door and shook me from the sheets. I tried to hide from them under my pillow but they came back and jumped over me. She finally left and I lost my sleep. I could use the opportunity and just get up. Maybe that would help me later to readjust my sleep schedule. Make it easier for me to fall asleep now. It's almost midnight and I have a throbbing headache since mid-afternoon.

I made breakfast for both Luis and me. I had time enough to shower and shave. Get ready. Yesterday I had picked up the clothes I'd wear. The jeggings and the lycra shorts were already over my chair. I could wear the long shirt over them. I just washed the long sleeved t-shirts. That was another option. When I woke up, I changed my mind. I took a pair of jeans. Luis was here, he would see me. He does see me. He notices and asks questions. How can I be that hypocrite to reprimand myself for not speaking up and not daring, and yet I still hide from them.

There was that other feeling. I hadn't stood in front of the mirror. I hadn't seen myself. I had only the image of how I perceived myself. I made a construction of my with just how I felt. I saw me as hideous. How could I wear those kind of things? I had that image in mind when I doubted again what to wear. I looked myself in the mirror. Times have changed. It used to upset me that the image of myself and the reflection didn't match. I felt myself as a woman and then my reflection would laugh at me. It would see me and mock me and laugh.

Now it's the other way around. I feel like this enormous and disgusting blob of a man. I dare to catch a glimpse and I look different. I look androgynous. I look like whatever I want. Now the problem is inside my head.

I picked Catherine up and went to the university. My letter is not ready yet. I haven't cleansed my face.

I took her to her session. She might close it. For now, at least. It hurts me to pause. It hurts me that she closes off the person with whom she talks about us. One of the handful of people who knows about me, who doesn't mix up. Who sees me.

She will talk with her dad. Not tomorrow nor next week. Maybe not even soon. But she will. He will know.

Do I wait for her to tell him so I can pressure myself to tell mine?

I'll tell Paola first.

I doubted how I looked. I decided to not wear lipstick. It was this weird feeling of not being seen. Of being mistaken.

Ramon came and said hi to Catherine. When I reached my hand, did he get close to kiss my check too? Or was it just his intention of pointing the place where his shoulder hurt?

People turned to me and scanned me. They turned more when Catherine kissed me.

I felt validated, confirmed, when the waiter looked at me and asked for my order. Was he just patronizing me? Did he know?

No. No. I won't take this from me. Not today.

For him I was a lady.

### 2016-01-30

I feel just like that other time weeks ago when the father and his baby saw me outside Rene's office. "Look at the girl", he told his baby. I repeated his words to myself when I was in bed.

What is it with me that I look for outsider's validation? Does it change anything when a third person looks at me and calls me with one of those words? Maybe they are condescending, maybe all the others are disgusted. There are a thousand maybes. Why do only some of them lift my mood? Why does it change anyway? I felt like I didn't fool anyone. To me, it was as if I were just a boy in girls' clothes.

"I didn't expect it either", told me Catherine yesterday. "You looked ambiguous. Your face was clean, there was no beard but no make up on your eyes or lips, either. You were wearing the jeggings."

She had mentioned that before. Me looking ambiguous. That was what I wanted at first. That was my goal two years ago when all of this started to come up. I wanted to be nothing. I wanted people to feel doubt. Everyone would see me and wouldn't know what I would be. "Is that a boy or a girl?" I wouldn't be invisible or ignored. I could be anything. They would be accepting by omission. No matter what I'd do, I'd be playing it safe. I fantasized with the idea of unconditional acceptance.

Now it's not enough. After all this time, I look for them. I wear the clothes now not just for me, not just for how I feel. I can see myself now, I can take pictures and let others see me. I wear them and I want to be out. I want to be seen and called something. I want to test them. Test my looks. I want to know how I'm seen.

I was nervous, I felt naked and vulnerable that day of july when we went to the pride parade. I remember changing clothes in the men's bathroom in that jack in the box. I got out and I felt everybody's eyes on me. There was this man standing near us in the bus stop. It was raining and Catherine was kissing me. I looked his way. Was he seeing us? What was he seeing?

Months later I would wear the leggings even before crossing the border. I would wear them as the normal clothes before changing. Halloween was the day. That other day when I was outside. The first one when known people saw me. That picture was the one that provoked Monica's argument. It was the last picture I sent her.

I would wear the skirt outside the hotel and my car for the first time. No. That's not true. Weeks before I was seen in that same disguise by Chevo and Jessica and Paola. Andrea was the first one the see me.

I remember being with Anahi that day. She didn't know my name yet, did she? She did. Catherine used it when she talked to her on her phone. In the United States nobody referred to me directly in any way. When we crossed back, a man approached us with a flyer and called us "girls".

I felt this same feeling which I'm talking about. It was addictive. It wasn't a sexual thrill. It was something more. A validation, a joy. All my life I felt invisible and people saw me. I was seen and noticed. I wanted to be out still. I didn't want to change yet. I asked Catherine if she wanted to do something. I wanted to go the plaza, maybe drink something. Anything. I wanted to be outside and seen.

Catherine was tired and I changed back later outside my home.

I've worn some clothes several times since then.

I've been called by different ways. And every time it's less enough. It's not an addiction. What is it?

I told Rene that it scared me having a date. What if it's prolonged? What if the time comes and somehow I miss it? What if I go to the appointment and I have to wait even more?

Even the waiting time that is certain, knowing how long it is makes it painful. The shorter the wait, the more it burns. It's like that sensation of needing to use the restroom and the closer you get, the more urgent is the need.

There is just two months now. Give or take 10 weeks to meet the doctor.

I have like 10 sessions with Rene before going. Will I tell my parents before that?



### 2016-01-31

"When will you take the suit to the tailor? The person might have a busy schedule, you must go soon."

"To most of those things, I'll be there with you, Sofi. You won't be alone"

I dreamed with Catherine. We were in my room naked and having sex. I came on her and she screeched loudly. My father came to my room and questioned what was that made a mess. He wanted me to show him to see if it could be cleaned. I was on my stomach butt naked. I tried to make him leave, but he insisted. He was oblivious to the fact that we were having sex.

In another dream I remember some sort of school, a building in which we both, again, were walking. Did we find her or did she? Zayra stopped us. No, she stopped me. No, we were leaving together and asked me a question. She asked me to say a little longer. Was I still interested in the project? Were we both? I called Catherine.

In another dream I was outside. There was my family too. It was like when we get ready to leave the house. Like a trip or something like that. The Mitsubishi was parked in front of the two cars. I walked to the trunk to put something there or take something out. My mother was there, too. She was trying to tell me something. "Don't you think it's time that you tell your dad about you?"

It was. I should. I had to. I remember the feeling of urgency. Now? No, later, when we were alone. How can you say something like that? Do you have to wait for a perfect moment or do you have to actually make the moment?

I woke up.

I finished seeing Steven Universe. Yesterday, before going to bed I saw the episode where they are in a motel. Ruby and Sapphire are arguing about how they feel with what Pearl did to Garnet. In the end of the episode they hug, they both are crying and apologizing and they laugh and fusion again.

"My laughy Sapphi"

I cried several times yesterday and today watching that children's cartoon.

"Are you watching that video?" Luis came to my room to see what was I doing again. I was on youtube after sharing a video of a song to Catherine. "Yes", I told him. I wasn't ashamed nor embarrassed. Why should I be?


Rinna posted a picture in Facebook about the differences in the definitions of trans terms. In english, I explained to Cath, they use transgender mostly now. It encompasses most of the trans community, like some sort of umbrella term. It means everyone who feels dysphoria with their gender and sex. Whose sex and gender don't fit.

Transsexual, in english, is a dated term mostly out of use outside the medical community. It's exclusive to people who have gone through medical and or social transition. It has this binary association, too.

In Spanish, there is some persistence with separating both terms. In English all transsexual people are transgender, but not all transgender people are transsexual.

The image which posted Rinna had the definitions of Cross-dresser, Transgender, someone who "identifies with the other gender. Most of them go through social and or medical transition to appear like women or men, and Transsexual, the ones who "feel like a gender trapped in another body". They correct this mistake with surgery on their genitals.

In Mexico and most Hispanic countries, the terms are separated. Transgender are the ones who "appear" to be the other gender. Transsexuals are the ones who have "the surgery". It annoys me this obsession with GRS. Again, it's like the only important thing is our genitals.

Our. I didn't write their, I wrote our.

Which am I? I am transgender. I've been transgender since two years ago. Even when I wear these clothes. Even when I'll wear a suit and formal clothing to both Tecate and my graduation, I'll still be whom I am.

With the hispanic terms, it's like I have to tell them about my genitals. They have to know them to know how to call me. Just to know what is the appropriate term I have to disclose the situation of my genitals. Dealing with this, my junk stops being an intimate matter and becomes public. Just telling them "I am transgender", I am telling them I have a penis.

They should not care. It's nobody's business but mine.

## February, 2016

### 2016-02-01

I followed Paola in Twitter. Yesterday I did it impulsively. It didn't work and I tried again. It did nothing. I left the phone and went to bed. I was talking to Catherine, I remember. I think so. She fell asleep before I did. In those moments of loneliness I grabbed the phone again and tried once more. This time I clicked the little oval of my face and a green checkmark appeared under it. I clicked accept. It was done.

She might already had seen it. Catherine posts things in her own profile. She tags me and has retweeted posts of mine. Paola and Chevo might have seen already how she writes she thinks I'm pretty or how she loves me. Maybe it was just a confirmation. Maybe it did surprised her.

I wondered if I could send her a text message to her. Telling her about the name, about me. Saying how she knows before Chevo and Jessica. "See, I don't want to leave you out." Asking her what she thinks about me telling Paola.

It worries me. What's her opinion on my name? Is it just a nickname? Is it just something to appease me with? Maybe I do project my own rejection unto others.

That wasn't how I felt when I woke up and saw the notification of her username following me.

I felt acceptance. I felt less alone. I was excited. I stayed in bed. The bed was so comfortable and cozy. I didn't want to get up. I did not until after noon. Luis came to my room and asked me, no, told me, we were going to eat. "It's too early", I answered.

He left. It was 1 o'clock.

I got up and swallowed my pills. I have just enough for tomorrow and the day after. I might need to ask Rene for a new prescription. It's more than 6 months old.

They have not said anything about it, but if they deny it to me, I would have to go one day without it.

I told my father about my glasses. They are loose and opened. One lens falls out from the rim. It was a mistake. He told me we could go to the optic and ask for a repair. They might ask for them back. I couldn't stay without glasses. I have already accustomed to this new prescription. Going back would be a headache.

My mother had to go anyway to repair hers. I didn't get off. I waited.

They asked me again about when will I go to the tailor. Will I go tomorrow? I should take it now. Fix it. Do something.

I don't want to. I don't want to wear it, I don't want to put it on and let someone take measures of it. I don't want to. I don't care. I don't care if it doesn't fit, if it looks hideous. I don't want it.

I should go anyway.

My mother saw my face when she asked me. Did she related it with what she knows? Does she still know? Does she remembers?

We went to this brazillian restaurant of meat. A sort of buffet where they keep offering you these fancy cuts. It was expensive. I drank a glass of sangria and my head hurts. I am irritated. I feel... something.

I have to go to the tailor and to the pharmacy. My mother gave me the money to the therapy. She asked me right after telling me of the tailor. She did relate it. She does remembers.

It might just be about giving me money. Paying for a service I need. Just as I would need their money to fix the suit, I need their money to go to therapy. To treat "my situation".

I was lying in bed thinking about everything and nothing I opened the calendar. I have the appointment on april 7th. A little more than two months.

I have less than 10 weeks. Ten weekends in which I can tell my parents.

I told my mother already. I talked and told and confessed. I shared. I felt this kind of euphoria and excitement the next day. Will it be like that when I tell my dad? Will his reaction be different?

Will I cry as much?

"I have women's pants" I said to him.

"You don't notice. I've worn make up and you haven't realize." I was about to say to him.

It was the alcohol in me.

Will it be cheating if I drink before?

Could I just tell my mom about the doctor and ask her to tell my dad?

Why does it feel forbidden? Who forbade it?

### 2016-02-02

"I was downtown and she came up to me. 'Hi, do you remember me?' 'Uh, yeah' 'I know you are angry with me, but I wanted to explain myself. I know Ivan is upset, too.' 'Sofia' 'That's what I wanted to explain, that's what won't understood. I had a puppy called Sofia, that's why I can't call her that, not yet.' "

She dreamed with Monica. I received her text in the morning and that little intro. The dream continued. She couldn't get rid of Monica. She followed Catherine with her explanations. She wanted to be understood. The first thing I thought when I read the conversation was how it was unbelievable. "She would never call me by the feminine".

Now, she wouldn't care being understood. She doesn't care about what we think of her. I imagined me opening a bridge and meeting her with a white flag. "Catherine dreamed about you tonight"

"I don't give a fuck", her phantom mocked me.

I woke up sick. I fell asleep sickening. I remember lying under the sheets and feeling the steely cold cutting my body. Like a sharp knife it penetrated the covers and sliced through my bones and muscles. I shrank my body into a little ball and hid static. Every little move was an opening and invitation to the cold.

I was burning. My head was throbbing. I thought about Catherine's patient. Ivan. The young homosexual man who died because of a acute case of meningitis.

Catherine never could give him closure.

What if that happened to me? What if my infection was fatal, too?

I fell asleep. I tossed and turned in a febrile haze. I half lived a semiconscious nightmare. The feeling of worry, of an unfinished task. The burden of responsibility and the imminent threat of failure. All the classic symptoms of my sick nights.

I woke up in the early morning and did some things. I went back to bed and tried to sleep again. I stayed in bed until the evening when Luis and my mother arrived from school. He was covering his head with the hat he bought in Disneyland. He wore a pair of blue skinny trousers. They cut his hair. I could see it in his face the feeling of wrongness. That uneasiness of looking different than how you'd like. I saw myself in him. More than ten years ago I was in his place.

"If you don't want to cut it, don't cut it. Tell your principal how he's being sexist. He doesn't ask the girls to cut their hair, does he?"

Nobody told me that when I was a kid. Nobody gave me that option. Of course I'd never take it anyway. "Sure, they might say that it's part of the dress code and if you want to have long hair you must wear the skirt, too."

If somebody had gave me that option, would I had taken it? I don't think so.

Why wouldn't I?

If I were with a psychiatrist and gave that answer that would mean a little cross on their mental checklist. I should had these feelings for most of my life. If I didn't have them when I was a kid, when they did arose? If they came suddenly, what was their cause?

It's not like that. I can see myself as 12 years old. Seeing that weird series in the Discovery kids. Was the one about a little angel? No, was it? That was a kid's soap opera. No. That was a mexican soap opera from the late 90's, the show I'm remembering was a South american series or soap opera. There was this boy whom I couldn't tell if he was a boy or a girl. He had long hair. I was amazed by it. Long hair to me was something feminine. He was wearing it. And instead of being mocked or harassed, it was nothing.

The doubt, the ambiguity was something I felt intrigued by. Could I be like that? Could I let my hair grow and people wouldn't know what or who I am?

I wanted long hair. I knew I had to cut it still in jr high. But My goal was High school when I could let it grow. I anticipated mockery and being misgendered. It never happened. And I got depressed.

Yeah, if they would had given me that option "leave you hair grow but wear the girl's uniform" I wouldn't had taken it. Because I wouldn't be seen as a girl. I would never be that kid. People would knew I was a boy, a boy in a girl's uniform.



### 2016-02-03

I'm still sick. I am tired and exhausted.

"My first pay as a psychologist", somebody wrote.

How the fuck do they do it? Where do they go? Whom they look for?

Yesterday Elena sent me message in Facebook. "Hey, cutie boy, how are you?"

It was awkward. Up from her text was her picture symbolizing the absence of a history. We had never talked before in there. She is the kind of people who uses compliments as openers. They lose their meaning. Saying everyone is beautiful is saying nobody is. I was just thinking about that in the morning.

I haven't taken hormones and I've gone out. I've been seen as a woman. Catherine's therapist called me her beautiful girl. A homeless person approached us in the car and told us how we were really pretty. Do they tell everybody? Did we deserve it? Even if I'm not attractive or good looking, I should feel validated. It's as if I had put myself a really high bar to pass. Did I want me to fail? I have passed without hormones. Not everybody does it. Not everybody can. I wasn't harassed or mocked. I miraculously passed the impossible test and yet I saw it as not being enough.

When she didn't answer back I thought about her latest post. Talking about a promotion, feeling blessed in her new job. The opportunities whatever... Would she offer me a position? Maybe she has to fill a vacancy, she knows I'm smart, she knows I'm capable. Why else would she come to me.

And yet, I wasn't relieved or excited. I got scared. I thought about excuses. Reasons which I could give to free myself. I felt like I was drowning. When I took consciousness of my own thoughts and reactions I questioned them.

What is it about a job that terrifies me?

What is it that makes me unable to find one? To even look for one?

She finally answered back and it wasn't about job. "Did I know about a movie that exemplified the theory of Bandura?" I was furious. She has a job and it's not able to do it. She looks for my help and will get paid for it. She doesn't even know about Bandura. "The vicarious learning?" I asked her. Bandura made numerous research with different approaches to Social Learning. "Learning by modelling" as if she knew what she was talking about. I gave her the answer she was looking for and ignored her thanks.

Yesterday I gave Luis his presents. I waited for him to open them and record it. I hate the pictures my family take. They look so fake and artificial. The poses fabricated and maintained until the shot is taken. I stood with them and smiled. I was wearing pajamas and my hair was a mess.

This first, my dad told him giving him my present. "No, no, that one first", I answered back. It was theirs. The gifts were in a bag and he knew what they were. He bought them with them. He chose them. He opened the clothes and the money. He took the drone out. It was now the time to open mine but my parent ignored it. Luis is in the mainframe excited and opening the boxes, trying to guess. My dad is too busy looking at the drone, talking with Miguel about the battery and the instructions. They didn't care. They ignored it.

Did I think about telling him about me as a way to scream for his attention or was it then a way of getting back at him?

Tomorrow I will have to leave the house. I will shower and get dressed and go to therapy. Last session I didn't talk about my mood being uplifted when the hobo saw me. I could mention the waitress referring me or the importance I place upon being noticed and seen.

I could talk too about the realization of that high expectations I had even before starting. I looked at people's timelines and was surprised by how they looked. Before and after their transition.

"They looked so... normal".

Masculine men, bearded, some even handsome. People I would see in daily life and I would never imagine it. Sure, some were the typical profiles I imagined but those others? Most look extremely different from their first pictures after starting hormones and their last ones months or years after them. Like completely different persons.

Almost nobody passed in those first months.

And yet, I expected to. I wore the clothes and stepped outside and faced the world.

I still do.

### 2016-02-04

"I will tell you three things, but only one of them will be true: I still think about you when I masturbate; I always remember you when I listen to this song called 'I hate you', I grabbed all of your gifts and pictures and mementos and threw them out"

Yesterday I thought about telling everyone again. I was lying in bed, waiting to fall asleep while my mind was running wild planning different paths in which the future could unwind. I saw myself again, posting some sort of Facebook thing. Like those idiotic things people use to pass the time. Those kind of social games. "Like this, comment this and I'll do something". It would be a little different. I would not expect a lot of people to actually see it.

"Send me a message and I'll answer back three statements. Only one of those is true. You can't make any question or intent to guess which one is real."

Later I imagine posting "I'm trans" and other two non-sense things. Then I thought about my own family. Would I post them the same thing? What if Monica liked it? Of course she wouldn't... but what if? That's when I thought about her again.

I actually mentioned her to Rene.

I think about that day in November, outside the movies. What was her impression. I talked to him about seeing my own reflection in the mirror and then seeing me in the eyes of others. Just after that I mentioned her and my curiosity of that day. It was a little later that I remembered the actual question I suppress.

"Did your boyfriend saw me?"

Did he? Did he noticed us? Did he ask her something? Did she tell? What happened?

If he did see me, was I recognizable? If he did recognize me, what was he reaction? I think about his reaction because I already know hers. I know the one of someone who supposedly loved me, it would be invaluable to meet the reaction of someone who despised me.

I sent her a text message in her birthday, but that was before we talked again. What was it again the reason I opened up that bridge? I remember how I was the one who sent the white dove. But why? I remember, too, how we stopped and why. She sent me a text in my birthday months later. Almost one to next week.

If I ask her, what would it mean? Would I lose this streak? This 96 days I have of writing daily, this 96 days of exploring my own self, loving Catherine, loving me.

Four days till a hundred. And now the thought of asking her that day is firm and heavy. In the hundredth day I could open that bridge and ask her. "Did he see me that day we met outside the movies?" That's the only thing I am interested of knowing.

That's not true. What I really want to know, what I really want to ask her is "Do you ever miss me?".

What I want her to know is, "I hate you. I haven't forgiven you, and because I know you don't even care is why I don't know if I ever will."

Why is it that I should forgive her of exactly?

What is that terrible thing that she did to me? She forgot me? She left? She promised her love and couldn't give her friendship? She was Ivan's lover, she was Ivan's best friend. I am not him. I killed him. I am the one who might ask for her forgiving.

No. No.

She insulted me and told me she couldn't be my friend. She is not ready to see me, to treat with me. I understood. I gave her the option to leave. I was then that Monica who gave Ivan the permission to go to the park even though I wanted him to stay.

I won't ask her. I won't talk to her. Not in these next four days, not soon.

I thought about writing that I could tell my dad this hundredth day. Would I really?

Now it just irritates me. Even pretending that I believe myself when I think of it makes me mad.

Catherine will arrive monday. I could buy her a cake for when I meet her at the airport. Next wednesday we will meet with Paola. I might be actually able to tell her. Except Rene changed the date and time of our next meeting and I just remembered.



### 2016-02-05

I remember that time I made Luis feel like crap. The time I screamed at him and could see his face full of guilt and shame.

Today I made him cry. He ran from the kitchen to his room and closed it behind him. He put the lock and held it while I tried to opened it. "I don't want you to enter" he said and I realized I was a monster.

I stood there in the darkness, waiting. I don't know what exactly was I expecting, what was I waiting from him. I just stood there.

All for just a couple pieces of fucking chicken. I laughed at him. I really laughed like I haven't in a while. Even Miguel followed my laugh. I wasn't mocking him, was I? I was... "I picked them and I won't even taste them" It was so tragic I had no choice but to laugh.

Arguing, counting, setting aside the pieces and administering the rations. We were so pathetic. How wouldn't I laugh?
I put all the chickens from the bag back in the plate. Why should we cook them separated? I could cook them all at once. We could separate it later. Since the beginning I knew that I wouldn't really eat all of them. Why did I say it anyway? Why do I mock him? Do I want him to hate me, to get away?

I came back after I cooked everything. I stood in that same spot of the second floor. I didn't say anything but listened. He was still sobbing. His sobbing was full of pain and sorrow. It was the sound of loneliness. I caused it.

"Won't you eat?" "Later, not now" "Everything's ready" "I'll go in a minute" "It'll get cold" "I'll go"

He hasn't come. I feared Miguel would eat the pieces. Would it be my fault? I made them for him. I told him they were ready. I did what I could. Why do I still feel like crap?

I woke up in pain again. This time I didn't open the eyes until after noon. I thought it was early like the days before. I grabbed the phone and saw the time and notifications. My throat was soar and it hurt. I took my pills and drank water. I haven't done nothing since.

"Ivan, have you eaten already?" His tone cheered as always. Like if nothing had happened. Do I resents him now? I remember how Monica used to tell me she hated when people acted like nothing had happened after a huge argument. I never understood her. What did she want exactly?

When I was outside his room I thought about entering and hugging him. Telling him my secret. Would I use that information as a bargaining chip? "Don't be mad at me anymore and I'll tell you something delicate". Or would it be like the times I would cry in Tae Kwon Do when I wouldn't meet the Instructor's expectations, and then I'd blame it on the pain of my surgery. He would realize it later. He told me he wouldn't want me to cry ever again. I stopped going.

It was hard, it was painful. I was accustomed to exceeding at everything I'd do. I never met with frustration. I succumbed at the first obstacle.

Do I think about telling my dad? What is it that stops me? It's not his reaction, it's not his perception, what the fuck is it?

"I like wearing woman's clothes"

I said it to myself in the bathroom and it felt embarrassing. It's the truth. I'm wearing woman's underwear right now. I like woman's pants more than man's. I like when people see me as a woman. Why does it shame me to admit it to my family?

Catherine asked me where could we go for her birthday next week. We talked about different restaurants. She'd invite everyone and just wait for the ones who'd show up. Miguel, Anahi, Yarely and her boyfriend, Chevica, Paolas, Vania and me.

Everyone would know about me. Everyone but her friend. What could I wear?

Should I hide? And that same thought came again. It all comes down to who knows. Whom am I hiding it from still? It'd be easier if all of them knew. Paola doesn't know still but I want to tell her. Will I? Will I really?

If my parents knew I could talk about it with them. Do I want to talk with them about this?

I need their support. Why is it so difficult to even fantasize about asking for their help?

### 2016-02-06

I lied on the bed shortly after writing yesterday's words. By 7 and a half I was already asleep. I remember dreaming but not what they were about. One of them was a nightmare. It came now. I was in my own bed with my arms over my stomach, hands crossed. I remember noticing myself, my own position, and thinking how it was a feminine one. One hand was grabbing the other just under my chest and the other way lower over my crotch. Yeah, there were two pair of hands and I realized the impossibility of being alone. I freaked out when the extra arms started grabbing and pulling me.

It was midnight.

Was it today?

Now I just felt as if it were a long and distant memory from a past far away. Was it yesterday when I made Luis cry? Then I woke up in the midnight and went to the living room and watched tv. I came back and slept again. Was it really yesterday? At what time did I wake up today?

My father went to buy breakfast. It was today. I had the idea of us going to the United States. We have to buy the stuff for my grandmother's kitchen. It's saturday and there might be things in the P.O. Box. So when I heard the sound of the door I thought my dad went just for coffee. He bought the usual and birria. Luis was upset again. My father had asked him if he wanted tacos and he said yes, but something about the place and how he liked the soup better. I don't know.

I ate around 9 or 10. I tasted a couple of spoons of the glass of soup that was left. Now I ate a beef taco from yesterday and the partial hotdog that was forgotten in the fridge.

I showered today and shaved. I shaved my legs and my face. I had nicks all over my shins, and was frustrated at the black dots in the chin. Whatever, two passes and a final one in the chin. Nobody will see me anyway. I did it for me. For the mirror.

I knew I'd feel lonely this couple of days. It's like... it's like I am not conscious of it. I feel it, it surrounds me but I forget about it. I just don't want to do anything, don't know whom to talk, whom to reach. Anything is a burden and the energy is not worth it.

Maybe it has to do with the guilt of yesterday. Luis' remark of "I don't want you to enter". He was sobbing and crying. Those were just a couple of pieces of chicken. I did fall on the ground laughing about his words. "I picked them and won't even taste it".

This morning I was upset with him. Like if it were his fault. Like he betrayed me. Being closed was some kind of permission to hurt each other.

"Thanks, Ivan" he said before going upstairs again.

Today he reminded me while we all were in my parents bedroom talking about his lack of sentri. "Like yesterday, when I wouldn't had tasted the wings I picked" as if he were reminding me this hilarious joke we shared.

That's the reason we didn't go and won't tomorrow either. Luis doesn't have a sentri anymore. After his birthday it expired. Mine it's the last one that expires, but my mother already has hers.

A couple of days ago my father came from the united states and gave the plastic card to her. "It arrived in the mail". They have their date of the appointment the last of february. After then it's two weeks for the replacements to arrive.

I don't have an appointment. Mine expires until 10 months ahead. Even then I have no way of proving my own economic sufficiency. Again, it all comes down to having a job.

I have to find one, get one. I won't apply to the master until way after that.

It doesn't matter. First it's the trip to Tecate and then the graduation and license. After that I will worry about a job.

I've been worrying since last year. It's just that I don't do anything about it. I sent curriculums but they didn't call me back. I was proud of my own resume. I was foolish and naive. Of course they didn't like it. But what is it that they want?

A woman? A man?

What do they want and what can I offer them?

### 2016-02-07

I finished Interstellar. I started where I left that other day, like 20 minutes from the beginning.

That's everything about today. All of the interesting things that happen, just a movie.

Why did I look for her again? Was it something in me that made me click her name in the stupid side bar I don't even usually use in Facebook? I saw her name and that green bright spot. I was talking with Catherine. "I feel lonely, too", was the last message I sent her yesterday before she fell asleep. Tomorrow she will come back. I'll pick her up from the airport. I'll get up early and go pick a cake. She sent me the address of the bakery. It's downtown. I could go there early and then just drive to the airport. I have to buy gas, too.

I open the conversation of Monica. 98 days. But that conversation it's not the last. It's from the second to last day we saw each other. It's from that day back in august I saw her after months. I remember that day now and I actually feel sorry for myself. It hurts me. It's this faint burn that I never really noticed. Was I going to park in the sanborn's or inside the plaza? She would meet with her friend -her now best friend- minutes after she'd see me. That's the day she set for meeting with me after months. More than 6 months. We haven't talked in person since then. I got my book back and gave her hers. I saw her face, I met the Monica I wasn't in love with.

I could had just left it there. Remember that day and went on with my day. Think about tomorrow, this week. Anything.

No, I clicked her name and let the browser drift to her profile page. It's a shortcut. I can avoid looking for her in the search box, as if I were an addict being monitored. As if my laptop had this little alarms that would go off in somebody's basement the moment I type her name. Nobody cares. Nobody is looking or monitoring. It isn't something forbidden. I can think of her, remember her, feel whatever I feel. I am allow to miss her.

Her last post was a meme, a reaction when' post with the face of the little mermaid. "When I want to buy converse and my mum tells me I should get some for work instead". I can't remember the number, she hadn't got to the hundred likes yet. Her boyfriend sure commented something. Would she ever see my posts this way? With Catherine's like and corny comment?

It wasn't the post, nor the likes nor the comments. It wasn't the pictures of her with her friends in Magic Mountain. It wasn't the cheesy long post of her friendships or the dedicated picture to her best friend.

Well, it was a little the picture of her friends. The fun that irradiates from their faces.

She has a job and she has friends. She went on a trip. I am in room, lonely as fuck without a job. I haven't sent the resume. I haven't waited for phone calls.

I'm just waiting. Waiting this week. Waiting to do the paperwork for the license, waiting to go to Tecate. Will I post a picture from there, smiling with whatever they give me to post it on Facebook and a stupid and cheesy "thank you" letter to all my friends and family?

Would she like it? I wouldn't get a hundred likes, but they would be several. And yet, so what? I may have three hundred friends on facebook. I may know people in more countries than the numbers on my fingers. And yet, so what? How many of those hundreds or those around the world really know me?

The closest ones, the ones who share a house with me don't know my name. That name. My name is the one they know. They do know my name. They don't know me.

Catherine knows me. RenÃƒÂ© knows me. Lili has heard about me as Carlos has, too. Miguel, as well. Anahi knows me. And the list ends.

Chevo, Jessica and Paola know about me. They don't know the name. I haven't told it to them. Has Paola seen it? Does it matter?

There still is a mismatch between my self and my reflection. My mental image and the one I see.

Which am I? Which is real and to be known?

### 2016-02-08

One hundred.

Today I reach 100.

I remember feeling like a failure when I forgot to write that day 101 days ago. No. It was more. It was the first time that I forgot. I had like 62 days writing continuously and then it ended. I never would have imagined I would reach this. That day I just thought about the streak. The days it counted. I had lost. And so I burn the silence. I reached for Monica. Two weeks later, in Halloween, the count reached 0 again. 100 days from now.

Today I'll pick Catherine from the airport. She will be arriving alone and I'll be there to welcome her.

"You know, just not Ivan in the house" her mother told her before parting. "People will talk". If that worries her, I don't know what she will think or feel whenever she realizes people have lots of other reasons to talk about us.

Ivan won't be at her house. I am not Ivan. I will pick Catherine up, not him. I am sitting now, typing this words in the computer. Reaching 100. I took a shower and did my hair and got ready. I sent her a picture of my face and a video of my smile. She'll arrive in two hours and a half. Miguel might arrive in two hours. Will he see me? Am I afraid?

If everyone knew about me I wouldn't have to be nervous. I wouldn't be hiding because I wouldn't be scared. There would be no reason to be afraid. I fear their reaction. I fear not knowing what will happen. Whenever they know, whatever will happened have had happened already.

When I think like that, it's so obvious. Why don't I tell it already? Why do I have to keep waiting and suffering?

It would be easier telling and not showing. Letting them know by my words and not my image. Let them imagine me how would I look and then showing them how I do.

I lost Monica after a trip. Is that why I am a little nervous of Catherine's arrival? Monica wouldn't let me pick her up. Monica wouldn't let me do a lot of things. No, did she ever forbid me something?

I don't want to think about Monica. I don't want to remember her.

The last idea I had of telling my father consisted in writing it and showing it.

"I have to tell you something but I can't find in my neither the words nor the courage to say it aloud."

I thought about that message that is still written inside my telephone. The one which starts "I want to tell you something, not because I have to, but because I want". I wrote it to 'everyone'. I wrote it as a manifesto, a shout to the world. It was really the message that I can't tell my dad.

And then I continued to elaborate the thought. What else could I write? I wouldn't want to do it with a long letter. I wouldn't be able to contain myself in my own skin while he reads the words from whichever screen I use. It has to be short. A paragraph, a couple of sentences.

He knows about people like me. It's a theme of current conversations in today's situation. There are jokes in Saturday Night Live, there are characters in tv shows, celebrities in reality tv families, new politics about our bathrooms and healthcare.

I don't think I have to explain what the word means. I will, though, have to explain how it applies to me. It won't be what trans is, it will be why am I one.

What if he doesn't believe me? What if he doesn't support it? It's not a decision. I don't need his money or his favors. No. I do need his money, but more than that, I need his care, his love.

"I want to tell you something but I can't find the words or the courage to say it aloud. I'm sorry for not saying it before, Dad. I am depressed. I am depressed because I don't like my body. Because I am not a man even though I look like one. I am transgender."


Would he be surprised? Would he hug me? Would he cry or be angry? He will go to Tecate to see my award. Should I do it before or after?

Should I use my phone or my computer?

Should I think in other way or should I just do it?

### 2016-02-09

"Have you chosen your suit already?" "Or a dress?" "Do you know how will you do your hair?" "Will you just tie it up? - Leave him, alone".

It's weird seeing red all of a sudden. The color of this word. Did I just change it yesterday? The 101st day will be in a new color.

Yesterday I went to pick Catherine up. "Oh, you already wrote your words? But I wanted to be on them!". She arrived late. I stepped out of the house a couple of minutes shy of three. I was wearing make up. I had the blue t-shirt over the jeggings. My lips were red and my eyes colored. I sent her a picture and then a video. I saw the video later. I replayed it at night. It's a three second clip of my looking at the camera and then smiling. The smile fades and I lift one brow after my eyes return to their normal size. Those contractions around the eyes everyone learns about trying to find the secret body language of happiness. "The true signal of a real smile".

I am happy. I am pretty. I am a girl. At least I look happy, at least I look like a girl.

Dressed and looking like that I went to buy gas. "Welcome" the clerk said. I saw in the other pump a familiar face, the one from last time. They meet maybe a hundred people every day. Why would they remember me? I avoided him anyway. Was his welcome masculine or feminine? Did I notice? I think I heard him say she. Maybe.

I spoke with a high tone but a low volume. Maybe he didn't hear me and deduce the amount from the bill I gave him. He grabbed a piece of cloth and dusted my car. Nobody had ever done that before.

From there I drove to the cake. Would I buy the one with different flavors or the coffee one? A senior lady with her, I assume, grand kid were picking a cake. They were looking at the big version of the one I had picked. The lady couldn't read the little letters so she asked the boy. A helper approached them and offered help. She ended up picking a different cake and the small one I was waiting them for. I picked the coffee one. I asked the lady for help and she picked it. Did any of them look at me funny? The kid kept turning towards me. Did he notice something?

I waited for Catherine in the airport. I was early. 10 minutes before the ETA. I knew her plane would be late. She arrived at 4:15. I took her home. After we went for food. Teriyaki and Yakimeshi. Her uncle would open us. He would see me. Didn't I care? I had forgotten. I thought she was kidding. I cleaned my lips. He called me boy, several times. I might have not noticed.

We had sex in her room. I finished twice.

Today she was going to see the doctor. She ended up deciding to go later than she was planning. I still woke up even after she finish her consult. She would be coming here. I had to shower. I did. She came a little after I had did my hair. I didn't wore a bra today. I wore just a t-shirt. Not even a shirt. I felt naked most of the day. Jhonny and Diana told me I look skinnier. Jhonny did. I said thanks. I might be in love. Or lack of sex.

The first thing we did in Uabc was meeting with Claudia. I had taken the dollars and putted them in Catherine's wallet. It ended in my purse by accident. Bag. My bag. It's not a purse.

I didn't realize they were two bills of 20. Or maybe I did, and foolishly thought that were enough. After there, we went to the main office. I did line for the certificate and then we paid the credential of students.

We bought, Catherine paid, for a wrap and fries. We shared it. We ate in the faculty, like old times. I proposed going drinking a clamato with a beer. We could go to a place, or the pub, I knew they sell it sometimes. And so we did. We could wait for jhonny there. And so we did.

Diana and jhonny won't be graduating until this semester. Do I envy them? Would I prefer still being in school or is it the idea of having more time?

I accompanied Catherine buying her groceries. It was nice, walking through picking food. Thinking what we could eat or prepare. As if we lived together. As if we could.

We can. Why couldn't why? Why did I like the idea of trip to Vegas then? It was in March. It would be even after graduation, another delay to finding a job. More time.

Tomorrow we will see Paola.

Yesterday I told Paola. Did I write about that, too?

### 2016-02-10

"She is Sofia"

I told Paola.

"Don't rehearse it." "You don't say it like that!"

I wore Catherine's jeans and the blue t-shirt. I was supposed to wake up early. Maybe I could go with Catherine to the university. I could accompany her. Then we could go to therapy, from there do something before picking up Anahi and then, finally, meeting with Paola.

I was in bed when Catherine sent me the text message that she almost was at the school. Maybe she could come home. We could do something here and going to my therapy. I'd wake up just to open her the door. I postponed the alarm and went back to sleep. I know I dreamed something with a costume. It was something black and red. It was a woman's costume. I remember comparing it mentally with the Harry Potter one. The Hermione one.

I could had mentioned that costume to Paola when we were talking about her son and the letter she would give him when he turns 11. "Did you know? We dressed as Harry and Hermione in Halloween."

Other opportunity was when she told us "I saw the Danish Girl" "Did you like it?"
But no. At some point I actually thought I would not say it today. The day would end and I would not say it. I would feel like with the contact lenses. A useless piece of no-person. If I could not her, how the hell would I tell my dad?

I dressed and put make up on. Catherine sent me another message saying she would not come. It made no sense. By the time she got here, I would already had to go to my therapy.

So I got ready and left. I looked just like monday. I was fine. I checked countless times in the reflections. People saw me. Kids, their parents. Passers-by would turn sometimes. I felt noticed, looked. I felt nervous and exposed.

When I got there, I sat and waited. I was Rene's only patient. "I wonder why nobody came." He let out non-chalantly. I am almost sure I misheard him.

We talked about Catherine's thing with Vania. How she doesn't know yet. The conversation with Jhonny and Diana.

"And you have what you'll wear?" She didn't know yet. I hadn't let out a word yet.

I don't worry about a job or an interview. I worry about being interviewed for the visa, I worry about what my family will talk about. What will they say about me?

Will there be a way to change my school papers?

From there I walked towards my car. I always avoid the reflection before entering the building. Today I used it to feel better about myself. That reflection was better than the mental image I had about me.

I drove myself to Catherine's home. She was waiting in the terrace. She waved me back when I saluted her. She made spaghetti and chicken. Her dog welcomed me. She doesn't bark at me anymore. I actually care for that dog. I worry now about her old age. What will happen when she passes away?

Today I masturbated in the shower. I pulled my own dick like I used to do it when I was a teenage boy experimenting with his junk. When I actually was scared of ejaculating. I remember thinking I had discovered my own cure to erectile dysfunction. I turned myself a little cleaning myself. I can't remember the last time I actually finished in the shower. I could not moan and scream. If I hear the next door lady and her kids talk, they sure did hear me pleasuring myself.

I can't picture that woman's face? Could she picture mine? Does she know who I am? Has she seen me? Or the other me?

After eating we went upstairs to watch an episode of Jessica Jones. We ended having sex instead.

I drove to pick Anahi up. We would meet with her outside her therapy. She looked pretty. She had a red lipstick, darker than the pencil I used today. I cleaned, no, Catherine's kisses did it. I just didn't reapply it.

After walking, and crying and walking again and sweating in the car I could see shadow in my face with Catherine. I asked her and she told me the truth. "Yes, not much, but it can be seen a little". I was disgusted. When I shaved today I accidentally dropped the razor and I guess the razor blade moved and it cut me.

I couldn't shave as close as other times. And yet it was noticeable. I would look like a man.

When I went to her bathroom to reapply make up I saw my face and liked what I saw. I looked fine. Why do I keep thinking I don't?

Even when she asked the question I was waiting for: "How do I call you?"

I gave the same moronic speech of why I am not comfortable. Why couldn't I just say it? "Yes, thank you, call me Sofia."

At least I did say the name. I said, though what I told Rene. "Call me how I look." That way, when they call me by the feminine form I'll know I look like a woman.

Although, with that phrase, when they don't, it will hurt me even more.



### 2016-02-11

Tomorrow I'll go to Tecate. It's the last city which we haven't gone together. I've already visited in, what was it, new year's? It was when my uncle asked us to pick a couple of bottles of wine for him from a friend of his. Tomorrow Catherine will pick me up from home and will drive us to school. There will be a bus waiting for us. We will see Hilda, too. Miguel, also. They will give us an award for our results in the test. My father will go, too. He will be looking for me. He'll be there and see how they recognize me. They say out loud the name my parents put on me and I'll stand and walk and shake some hands and receive something. Paolas know about me but my parents don't. They know how I feel and how I'm called. Chevo and Jessica have seen me in make up and dressed. My parents don't.

Luis might intuit something. He touched my back and open my drawer. He might have seen my bras or my mascara.

How easy is for me now compared to a year ago to write those words. I remember cringing and actually hurting thinking and typing those words. Cross-dresser, transgender, girl, woman, bra, dresses. Make up. Faggot, tranny. Even those which I still hate I can type them and say them out-loud. They've lost their power over me. I'm not scared of them anymore.

I'm still terrified of saying them about me, though. I hesitated and tumbled after I said the nuclear sentence. "I am trans." After that I was lost. How could I explain it? With which words could I illustrate the way I feel? I don't "feel" like a woman. It's not a delusion. It's not that I really think "god made mistake". I'm not anyone trapped inside any body. This is my body, I am who I am.

I want to be me. I want to look like I want, and dress how I want. I don't want to disguise or impersonate as anybody.

But I want to be seen and recognized. And at the same time I want to distance myself from the person people have seen me as this many years. I don't want to be the person they expected me to become.

"How do I call you? ... I thought something like 'Ivana'". I was repulsed without even noticing. I made a face and waved my head. "No, ok". She was trying to understand. She was the first one to ask me. To ask me just as I told them. Anahi was the first one to ask me after I thanked her for calling me, treating me as a woman. Paola did it too when I mentioned the name. This Paola was the first thing she said, she asked or wondered. She didn't thank me, nor say she would support me, nor tell me she'd be by my side no matter what. She just wondered how she'd call me. How do I want to be called. She tried to understand.

After saying it, I realized I'm not even close to being ready to tell my dad. I might be able to tell Luis. He opened up to me again. "I don't feel like I feel in my classroom". It was uncalled for. I didn't ask him anything. From nothing the comment was born. He just wanted to share how he felt. With me. He said it and I asked why. He's the most serious kid in his class.

I was the most serious kid in mine. Everyone would always describe me with that adjective. Whether or not people already saw me as an intelligent kid, I was a serious one first. I would not play loudly nor be aggressive. I would not make jokes, I would be calm and still, quiet. I would be like the poster child of the expression "children are meant to be seen not heard". Even in Spain, Consuela would be exasperated by my not talking. "You never say anything, tio".

Now I can't talk even though I want to.

In the way to Catherine's home I opened up about the introyected belief of never accepting what people offer to us. My grandma taught my mom to don't accept anything. If she wanted water or anything she could get it home.

When Paola offered us drinks, I hesitated. Just like when Monica's mom would offer me anything years ago.

Like that, I realized the theme of the insight. "That's why it's hard for me to ask for anything."

Like for instance, take anybody's initiative to ask me how I want to be called. In my mind it's still impossible to ask to be called Sofia because to me it's impossible to be seen like her.



### 2016-02-12

"Did you see the whole conversation?... 'Sophie: baby steps'. "

I could wake up fine. I think not even the first alarm blared. I opened my eyes minutes before 6 and awaited until time came. Someone was in the shower before the second alarm just approaching the first quarter of the hour. Was Catherine or I the one who started the conversation? I got up and went to see. Miguel was buttoning on his shirt. My father was the one taking a shower. I thought he was the one who always got ready first before waking up Miguel. It was better this way. Now I'd be sure he'd finish any moment. I left the clothes and the towel in the white handle of the stairs. When he exited the room he was actually looking for me as I met him there. I had time for everything. I could sat in the toilet, shower, brush my teeth, even shave normally. It wasn't rushed nor half-done. Three passes calmly. Not as close as other times, but just enough. No, almost enough. I had black spots screaming all day.

"Congratulations, young man". Even wearing a tie and formal attire, even though all those pictures, it was a nice day.

"Are you nervous?" "Not nervous, uncomfortable" She understood. Of course she did.

She picked me up after Luis and my mom had left. I was playing the city simulation app in my phone so I missed her last two messages. She called me and I went out. There were no q-tips. We weren't late but we didn't have time to waste.

We got there just fine. We parked where they told us we could. They gave us "a little lunch". A brown paper bag with a bag of chips, a granola and a juice box. The trip was a little less than an hour. When we got there. I registered and waited with Catherine. There were beverages and tapas. I was anxious and uneasy inside the theater. I was surrounded by my classmates from both generations. Hilda, Ramon, Ana Karen, Patricia, Andrea. We were the awarded ones. They were talking and chatting. I felt as if my ears where underwater. At first I conversed with Andrea but her voice was empty, baffled, muted. I nodded and smiled but my leg was restless. When we got separated by their attempt of organization I felt a pulse of relief followed by a fog of sadness and loneliness.

"Will they give us a trip?" Hilda would ask me after meeting a minutes before entering. Samantha told me she was the only one who got three overachieving from her generation. From ours it was only you, me and Anna. Will they? It could be an opportunity to another trip with Catherine. It would mean so much to me. Being prized a trip to the capital, to my city of destiny. By my merits they would actually take me to where I want to go. To where I can be me and find my future.

Even if they don't, I will go there.

I was in the theater without a phone. It was inside Catherine's purse. Catherine was texting with my dad. He was already there. Both of them would be some of the last people to enter. When they enter we wouldn't even be already seated. I found them before they saw me.

They took pictures. They saw me, they might had clapped. They saw me walking and thanking and hand-shaking and smiling double up there in those big screens. All of it is recorded in Catherine's iPhone. One of the list times they will call this name.

Was it my imagination when the master of ceremony was naming us and checked twice at me when he saw my name in the list and me standing in front of the line. It must have been.

It would not be impossible to them to reaffirm because of the doubt. "Gentleman, sir, young man": "Look, I know what you are. I got you. You don't deceive me".

Catherine picked her parents from her airport. From there we went to the movies. There was a young kid with his mom behind us in line. The theaters were almost full. We bought or seats and went to eat. A hot dog and chicken taquitoes. A big thai tea with milk and a bottle of beer.

We saw the movie and she brought me home.

It was in the parking lot. I saw her phone and her conversations. The last one from Paola caught my attention. "It was even nice to see him!".

Was it me she was talking about? I opened and was even more surprised by the message. She met Garab near her therapist. Just as we were talking about him. "Did you see the whole conversation?" Why was she upset? I showed it to her. It wasn't my intention. I wasn't snooping. Of course I saw nothing.

She covered her phone and looked at something. And then she saw me the picture from the conversation. A screencap of a list of contacts. My picture and a nickname.

Why would you send her the picture of her contacts? Yeah, you have me as... No, you have me as Sofia. That means... oh...
"Now I officially have you in my contact list."



### 2016-02-13

I was in bed when the idea struck me. There will be a congress in Sinaloa, Mazatlan. A "national" congress of psychology. I saw the names of the conferences and they were simple stuff. Nothing new. Again, the same about autism and children. The role of schools and teacher. There was one that caught my attention, maybe the only one I would actually be tempted to attend. "I accept myself, others accept me - sexual diversity" It's almost sure that it would be presented by someone who barely knows what they're talking about. A so called "expert" like my teacher of Sexuality in college.

"There are no experts here... You could be the first."

If I'd know more than that person, why couldn't I just do the conference myself? What impedes me from making it, take together all the papers I've gathered and do a half-hour conference of what is and isn't gender dysphoria. The changes that came with the release of the ignored DSM 5. Is it or not a mental disorder? How can it be treated? What should the health practitioners do when they meet with patients or clients like them... like me.

One thing led to another. The couple of students when to some country in south america to a congress of social psychology. They did a reasearch. I still have the plan of mine. I could do a form in internet and share the link. A survey of the attitudes towards transgender people. What do health students feel about transgender clients? Would doctors see them as mentally ill? Would they deny them treatment? Would they refer them to a psychiatrist with the intention of transition or to take the delusion away?

Would psych students see them as mentally ill? Would they treat the dysphoria even though it weren't the cause of consult? Would they propose, support or try to dissuade transition?

What would school teachers do when a student comes to them with these issues? Would they punish a boy for wanting to wear the girls' uniform? Would they make him cut his hair?

Would all of them let them use the bathroom they prefer? Would they deny their identity? Respect their names?

I thought about all those things. What instruments could I do? Could I make just one for everyone? Maybe I could draft different versions depending of the sample on which they'd be applied. One to medical professionals, one to psychotherapist professionals. These would have questions of experience and attitudes, personal and professional. I thought about other one to both students of medicine and psychology. And there could be a third version towards teachers or administrative staff on primary schools.

In bed I thought about the samples. Could I apply them in elementary schools? Making appointments with the principals and talking about the proposal of the study. I could make a list of all the schools in the different zones of the city and make a random sample with them. I could take the list of professors from the university and use that to do the sampling. I could go to the biggest universities or just the faculties of medicine of the UABC in the whole state.

Will I make them in paper and pencil? I could make an online survey and send it towards the professionals by email.

Gathering the results, the analysis would be the easiest part. Comply the data base and just analyze it. See what results from there.

And just then I could think of myself. Why would I want to do that? Yeah, I could ask for help and write a paper. Publish it somewhere and it would help me for my career. But is that the reason? Do I want to do a conference with the results? Do I really want to be an "expert in gender issues"?

Or do I just want to know what will the professors or doctors think about me? What will society say about me? What will my colleagues think and feel?

I would not dare give the survey to Rene. "Have to treat a patient like this?" "Would you refer them or treat them yourself?" "Would you support transition?" "Would you try to dissuade them?"

Am I scared of the results? Why don't I want to know?

Why isn't the sample of the study society itself or parents and family? Why don't I apply the focus of the study to the transgender population instead?

I don't care about knowing about me. I want to know what will everybody else think and feel about me.

"Shy the girl... oh yeah, she didn't want to see the dad, but the daughter?"

I heard the sound of the door opening and closing. Both when my dad left and returned. I was awake when I heard the sound of the bags. My mother came down and the voice of Luis entered my room. Why didn't I step out? I wasn't hungry. I waited. "Nobody is up yet?" My father had bought birria.

Anahi asked me if I'd see Catherine today. Just now, writing these words, the thought of Monica popped up. Her ghost standing behind me and picking my shoulder, just as she hated to be done unto her. Laughing, teasing. I remembered how years before... No, we didn't send messages or gifts. Did we celebrate this day? Last year she was in France. Last year I fucked with Catherine in a cheap motel downtown. The year before that I was in Spain. What did I do?

Valentine's day. Anahi sent me something and congratulate me. That was when she asked me if I'd see Catherine. She didn't want to do anything today because all of her friends were in a relationship. She demanded we went out.

Yesterday I asked Catherine that we wouldn't. I felt ill. I felt sad.

My mother published several pictures and posts about my award. Pictures of me with my dad, even with Catherine. Countless likes and comments congratulating me. Both me and my parents. That made Catherine feel something. She didn't like that. "The shared effort". Congratulating her son. Both mother and son. A shirt and tie. They called my name and I was handed the diploma. They shook my hand and congratulated me as Ivan, just as Rene said they would. Whenever he would warn me, I'd hear him as if it were something stupid. Of course. Of course they would say that name. I would never ask them to call me differently. But then, me, there, starting to walk when they say that. Knowing I'm seen as I've always been seen before.

I don't follow Monica anymore. None of her posts nor pictures appear on my screen. I have to actively and purposely look for them. I don't know what she did today. I don't if or where she went. I should not care. Until now I had not given a single thought to it. Now I imagine her and her boyfriend sitting in the movies like that day in November.

I was irritated even by the picture of Eusebio and Jessica. What was it with them that upsets me? Do I resent Jessica for her comment the last time we saw each other? "I don't know what is it, but I don't seem to flow with you". I felt, betrayed? No. I felt pressure. I had to entertain her?

Was I angry? Was I disappointed? Was I feeling guilt?

 Why do I feel tempted to look for her now? So what... she went out to see Deadpool with him, how will I feel? She went nowhere, does it make a difference?

I know now for sure that there will be a trip to receive another award. The real one now. Given to the people who get the greatest score on all the areas. Hilda will go, too. I started typing a message telling her but I deleted it. It's late. That's not what I want to tell her. That's not really what I want her to know. She's not even my friend.

Now I'm thinking of Melissa. Is she working with Ahmed? Does she have a job, too, like everybody else? Do I want to know? Do I want to talk with her and ask her? Why would I want any of them to know? What difference would it make? I would gain not a single advantage from their knowing. Not like with my dad or brothers.

The date of the award and potential trip is near May and June. A month after April. I have to dismiss that reason for keep avoiding looking for a job. Why does the idea scare me?

Catherine sent me a message. It was true when I told her I felt like crying.

I love you, I adore you, I want you, Sofia. You are my friend, my girlfriend, my pretty girl. I like every part of our story, the sad, confusing, stressful ones, because they make me enjoy even more the funny, caring, cute and calm ones. I love you for who you are. I don't care if there are days that you dress like a boy and others like a girl. I like you, Sofia. You know that it doesn't have to be Valentine's for me to tell you these things. But I can use it as an excuse to say it again. I love you, I adore you, my girl.



### 2016-02-15

Now I do think about it. It's like this silly fantasize which I am embarrassed to admit. I'm there with you, and we're both standing in front of each other. We both look beautiful in our dresses and we're both smiling and happy, around us are the people close to us, the ones who always knew since the beginning and those who went learning it as time went by. People who accept us and love us. People who've seen our growing.

We kissed as equals, as brides, as lovers. We're united and we're going to share a life, a future. I am no longer afraid because I'll have you by my side. I am no longer scared because I will never be alone. With you I can conquer my future. Together, the world is ours.

I do. Of course, Catherine, I do.


We talked about this. It swapped between us. I was sure to tell everyone that I would not marry. Why should I? Why would I? No. Marriage is not for me. I don't want a wife. I will never want to be anyone's husband. Denying it was giving power to myself, to my decision.

Now, I don't see that way. I love the idea of it being a secret. Not because I don't want anyone to know, but because I don't need to. It's our thing, it's our intimacy.

I will do it, I want it. I want its benefits. Legal and social ones. I want to be able to receive a job proposal and take her with me. I want to be able to accompany her wherever she goes. I want to live in the United States with her.

I woke up early. I was going to wear a t-shirt and a hoodie. I changed my mind and put a whole different outfit. The first androgynous shirt I bought. The red long shirt, thin with squares. I paired it with the skinny jeans and gray sneakers. I put make up and saw myself in the mirror. I took a picture of my new shaded glasses and sent it to Anahi.

"I have now a pair of sunglasses!". She would answer me back later.

The moment I woke up, I felt like I always do. I felt this disassociation. I expected to be surprised by the difference between my own self-image and the reflection that would meet me in the mirror. One a girl and one a boy. Different. Mutant, changed. Abnormal.

I met the reflection and was, in fact, surprised. My hair was tied and my skin pale. My eyes seemed wide and open. I looked feminine. If a couple of months ago I'd see that reflection as a picture of my picture self. I would believe I had started hormones. I see my own face changed. I hadn't shaved nor combed my hair. I was just out of bed.

There are not just those two things anymore. The distance doesn't lie anymore between how I feel and how I look. There are three different faces. How I feel, how I look and how I expect to be seen.

Does it surprises me when we're welcomed in the feminine way?

Catherine offered to pick me up at the last minute. She arrived and I met her in the car. We got just in time. She borrowed my tweezers and cleaned her brows. The guardian of the gate stopped us just before entering. I lend her my own id to enter. They almost never ask for it anyway. Now he wanted to see both of ours. He chatted with her while I looked for Catherine's in her purse.

The first conference was about bioethics and the procedure of getting approval by the committee. The next one, was a study of the self-efficiency of teenager's parents about their ability to talk with them about sexuality. We left to eat. She drove me to the wings restaurant. The hostess received us one way, but their catchphrase of welcome at the table turned to the masculine form.

I doubted about what I heard. I didn't ask until later in the day.

Back at school we attended Yadira's conference. She mentioned us. Looked at us and called our names when introducing the collaborators. Ivan. Ivan was the name she said. Of course it was.

I went to Colef wearing a bra and long shirts. I didn't care. It was like a job. Would I do that at my own job?

The last conference was by one of the psychologists that were in the panel in Ensenada. The one who went to Vienna and Bulgaria. He's doing his post-doctoral work in a university in Paris.

I was excited, motivated. I want my future to be like that. I want my life to be like theirs.

"If you want to dedicate to research, you will have to be accustomed to dealing with rejection... You'll get tons and tons of it. The good thing is that later you won't even feel it".

Am I capable of it?

### 2016-02-16

I was just thinking about starting to send the curriculum. Initiating the search and lookout. Sending myself out there. Stop waiting for when the dr finally gives us our results. I don't know when will that be. Maybe it would be even after my own graduation. Maybe I would keep waiting and time would catch up and...
the message of Catherine brought me out of that thought. "The Dr has our results we can pick them up Wednesdays from 12 through 2."

My therapy is at 1, but I can pick them up at noon and going to my session from there. Anahi told me she would call me around that time too to confirm where we could meet. She kind of remembers where Rene consults.

It's mid-February already. Half a month and we get to March. Less than two weeks and I have the act and the party. I have two weeks to tell my parents for them to know at my grad. So I could really get over that, close that stage and phase. To start a new. After telling my family, anyone else knowing doesn't matter.

My father is the most difficult person to tell. It's whose reaction I fear the most. Whose face I can't even imagine finding me dressed in an outfit like that.

Once I dreamed going to a party in a dress and flats with a rose on their front edges. I had a phone and wondered where to put it. I was wearing a purse and it was normal. Except it wasn't. Was I thinking of my own father's reaction?

"But why are they flower patterned?"

Because I like them. Because I ordered them like this. Because I asked for women's.

Will I tell Luis now that I told Paola? It was a rehearse. It was a mock up, a trial. I failed. I realized how unprepared I am. How I can't explain it. I had to use the movie as a backstory, an example. What could I tell my own dad?

"Do you know gay people?" "Do you know any transgender person?"

Yes, no... "Why?"

Just because...

I feel like a coward and at the same time I'm angry at myself for yesterday's thoughts. I didn't deny my emotions. I took responsibility for them and acknowledge them with Catherine. I am scared of her leaving. I am scared people in the know will abandon me. A part of me still thinks that they're entitled to. They should. I was upset my Paola's reaction. Why would she ask how to call me? Why would she care for my own comfortableness?

I don't deserve their caring. They should not care. Their caring makes me feel spoiled. I should suffer. I should be antagonized and discriminated. Is that really what I want? Or is what I expect?

I'm not ready for my parents to ask me those questions. "How do we call you?"

"I'm not one of your 4 men" I wanted to tell her. Mention her in passing. Just saying. I am not. Stop.

What do I want her to say instead? My men and something else? My 3 men and a half? My men and girl?

That would be even worse.

That's the thing. Their caring and acceptance feels worse to me. I don't want to be rejected, but being accepted feels false. "How can I ask them to call me Sofia if that's not my name? My parents didn't name me that way, that name didn't accompany in my childhood. I didn't grow up with it" "How could I ask them to call me by the feminine way if I don't look the part? How can I be a she if I look and dress and sound as a he?"

Now it hurts. I don't want to be seen as Ivan. I don't want to be called that. I don't want to be seen as a man, as me, as him.

I want to wear whatever I want. I don't care about the strangers' opinion but I do care about my father's. I do care about the people who do know me. The people who still see me as Ivan no matter how close I shave or how I dress.

And like that I am stuck. I introduce myself as Ivan because I can't adopt the other name. I keep wearing those clothes because I don't care to be seen any other way. I still use this voice because of the fear of being clocked faking.

It's a commodity this limbo. It looks as if it were an accident. "Oh, my mistake, I thought you were a woman, I am sorry", instead of "You almost fooled me. I could see you for who you really are. Shame on you for hiding yourself".

I want to stop hiding anymore.

But... but, I am still scared of being seen.

### 2016-02-17

"you mentioned something just now, that: "ambiguity'"

Paolas know about me. Anahi knows. Catherine has known since the very beginning. Chevo and Jessica were the first I told and yet now they are the ones who know less.

"He has friends" "And what am I, jackass?" "My friend (feminine)". I have no male friends.

"You were going to be my best friend. I've never had one. Catherine has Miguel and you were my candidate".

Have I ever had one? Medrano could count maybe, in jr high. He thought I was crazy. I made him believe that. I remember one night when he confessed to me about stealing a pair of panties from his neighbor. I couldn't help to imagine myself in his place, empathize with him. But it wasn't the same. He stole them to masturbate, to think of her. Other time we were debating. Why would homosexual parents not have the right to adopt a kid? He told me he accepted them, but it wasn't about them. Society wasn't ready. Other kids would bully the child. It was for their best.

I disagreed. Why would they suffer from the sins of the rest? It's not their responsibility. Society is wrong, so change society.

"I defended you, Andres, I never cared that you were a faggot"

To him, he did good. His intentions were good. Would he understand me? Would he imagine it?

Alan maybe would be my best friend in the first semesters of high school. I was excited when I learned he would be in my classroom.
Would he understand? Would he care?

"If you were gay I would tolerate you, I would accept it and let you live your life. I just would stop talking to you and end the relationship". Those were the words of Israel, from first semester. I liked him. He sang sometimes and played the guitar flawlessly and full of life. I would remember him walking through the streets in Salamanca hearing the flamenco musician. "This is so spanish" Helena said when we walked from the cathedral to the library.

The second half of high school Monica was my best friend. Graduating she became my girlfriend. We were lovers. We were happy. Or so I thought.

"Time it was, and what a time it was. It was a time of innocence, a time of confidences. Long ago it must be, I have a photograph preserve your memories. They're all that's left you".

That song would play in the video I made for her while I was in Spain, missing her.

I can't remember the last time I saw that video. I think I deleted it.

I have a two hour one of the seven of us. My best friends. The closest ones to me, the ones who were with Catherine and me in the Sierra, one of them, the only male friend I have left, they don't even know my name.

"I am in the middle. I dress this way but is ambiguous. I don't show myself neither as a male or female. I don't commit. I let the responsibility to others. When they see me as a man after calling me a woman it's their mistake "Oh, I am sorry, I confused you". If I do it on purpose, if I wear a dress and full make up, it becomes my intention. My choice and responsibility. It's my fault then. "You didn't fool me. I saw who you were. You are really a boy.

"I don't want to commit until everyone sees me as a woman. If nobody questions me, then I don't have to defend myself. I am not ready to answer back whenever someone tells me "you are a man". How can I say: "no, I am not". "You have a penis, and XY chromosomes" What can I say then?

I said it before though. I almost screamed it. "I am not one of your 4 men. I am not a man!"

After school Anahi and I accompanied Catherine to see her dress. We were in the shop, that little spot in a swap meet. When Catherine stepped in to try it, Anahi asked me "Which one do you like?" "For her?" "No, for you".

How could I answer that? I've never shopped for a dress before. I've never picked one or try one of them. I've never even worn a long dress. How could I know what I like?

We kept walking and got to the bride ones.

"For the wedding" she said.

Would we wear two of those?

"Sometime we'll do the shopping and make up and all of this together".

### 2016-02-18

"You don't look like this. Do you have an id? It's ok, you gained some weight, didn't you?"

"Thank you very much... Angelica" "Sofi"


I was desperate. I couldn't take it anymore. Yesterday I was Ivan again. It was too much. Even Catherine slipped several times. I didn't care about the border, I didn't care about the pharmacy. I wore the sweater and make up. I even wore it before crossing.

In the pharmacy I asked for the happy pills in a little higher voice. The pharmacist looked at the prescription and said nothing about the name. "The bottle has 14 pills" "Give me 2" I whispered and raised two fingers to confirm silently. She went behind the counter and took them. "They will charge you here ..." I couldn't hear what word she used. Was it son or was it daughter? How did she see me? How was I seen?

I let it go.

"Let me give you a hug because I won't be seeing you this often." Liliana told Catherine about the different projects she has. She offers them to her own patients because she knows them. To external people, like me, she interviews them to see their aptitudes and skills. So later we might accord a meeting.

When we left the consult Catherine confessed to me how she could see some shadow on my upper lip. Was I ok? Was it fine telling me?

I was going to mask it after the pharmacy, but there was no point. Why should I? I'd cross the border and be interviewed by the border patrol. Instead I cleaned the red of my lips.

There was a short wait. We waited less than half an hour outside the offices. Then Catherine passed to the booth. "Do you speak Spanish? How do you say 'I like you'?" "Me gustas" "Thanks!" and high-fived her. I was called by the facing officer with a motion of his wrist.

I was unrecognized.

Until later I would think about it. How many cards do they read an hour, a day? Do they look at the info or just at the picture? Did he give up when he noticed the 'male' part? What was the point in another id? I am a man. That was the dissonance between the pic and reality.

He let me pass and I was still scared.

We were driving towards Liliana when I got lost in thoughts: "Is it illegal to carry a taser?"

"What would you expect me to do if someone said an insult or made a face or something? What would you do?"

I have reasons to be scared. That's the danger of leaving the ambiguity. That's the danger of leaving and living.

I didn't colored my lips again. Catherine would hide the shadow but after eating. First we walked to the adults' school. I waited outside the office. I sat in a bench looking at my reflection. Several people passed by and saw me. A girl smiled. What do they see?

Why do I care? What difference does it make?

I entered the bathroom again. I sat in the cubicle next to Catherine. My penis never looks or feels as big as when I seat in a toilet seat where no penis should be.

We ate in the in'n'out. Catherine ordered. We ate outside. We talked about Monica. "What did you feel when we told you yesterday that you were fixated on Monica?"

Catherine is not Monica. She doesn't replaces her, because she doesn't need to. I like Catherine. I like being with her. "You're my first real relationship" "Monica was your first everything"

Monica taught me what love feels like. Now, with Catherine, this is something different. It feels different. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't scar. It lifts me instead of drowning me. It makes me want to get up and live instead of hide and die.

But it's not a comparison. I never wanted Monica. I wanted to be her. That wasn't fair. That wasn't right.

We boarded the trolley again and got out in Palomar. Target. We looked in the feminine section. Clothes, blouses, dresses. I didn't find anything. Was I really looking? There were no purses that I liked either. I had more than 50 dollars in my wallet but now the need of spending them wasn't there. It was fine that there were nothing. We saw the underwear and I bought a bra.

A blue, wireless bra. Like the one Monica gave to me. Smaller than the rest I own. Monica's size, actually.

People saw me. Catherine gave the sweatshirt that her parents bought me. I changed the girl's sweater to it.

The day wasn't fulfilled until a person addressed us as ladies.

I wasn't seen until I confirmed that somebody really saw me.

### 2016-02-19

My head hurts. I have a headache. What's the difference between those two statements?
In one I separate my head as in a part of my body from myself. The head hurts. It's a separate entity from me and the whole action that causes discomfort is caused and effected on it. In the second, I take responsibility for my pain. I see myself as a whole entity, a complete system.

5 years ago if I'd read this, would it be enough to convince me that I already am a psychologist?

I am not a psychologist. I have no doctorate. I have a bachelor's. I don't even have a certificate of profession. I haven't walked in black robe with that silly hat.

I'll graduate and leave this person behind.

"Have you thunk about telling Luis?" No. I won't tell him nor my parents again until after graduation. I hesitated about telling them before my birthday. How awkward would it be for them to know and be with me? The graduation is supposed to be a party, celebrate my accomplishment, what I've finished. They can celebrate it, have a last nice memory of their son.

I think about it as I'm writing this. Rene's hesitation was subtle. It was a passive idea thrown in silence. How different would it be if I were with another therapist?

Writing about it, projecting my own hesitation in the well-being of others, denying my own fear and anxiety using them as an excuse. "Is it really for them that you have not told them yet?". Is it really that bad them knowing who their child really is and accompanying you, knowing you? Wouldn't it be a great time for them to know, celebrate who you've been and celebrating the future that awaits you?

That sounds so humanistic that even me from 2 years ago would have been surprised to know I said it. Is what Lilliana would tell me or what would I say to me as a patient?

I have the contact of Liliana to concert a meeting to talk about the project. Rene told me, assured me that nothing impeded me to introduce myself to my patient as the psychologist Sofia. It I didn't sound nor looked as a woman, if whomever I would attend questioned my gender it had nothing to do with the process.

Why does it still scares me, though? Even contacting Liliana makes me nervous. Introducing myself to her again. "I'm Sofia, Catherine's girlfriend". And then should I present myself to her dressed feminine? And then introducing her contact femininely? And then going to the course or the session in make up and a blouse?

Where would I draw the line? Liliana knows me and has seen me. The contact doesn't know me yet. He has a blank idea of who I am. And then, the people with whom I'd work, the ones who could accept me or reject me.

What would it mean going to work as Sofia? Does it excites me or scares me?

Would I really get to the point to changing after leaving the house and before returning? Would I introduce myself to strangers before even to my own family?

I already did that.

"Angelica" "...Sofi"

Did she believe me?

Does it matter?

I still have a headache. I woke up early in the morning with Luis and my mother's voices. His egg broke. Something. I don't care. I had trouble falling asleep again. I finished the Utena series and then watched the movie.

Somebody from the elections institute came to notify Miguel he was elected to work as a functionary. My father too.

I did some laundry. I finished with my underwear and whites. The blue bra that I bought yesterday is still in my bag with the etiquette.

Catherine went to the doctor. She will have a surgery in her lower back. She's numb but scared. She's pressured by the time. As I am.
She has the invitations to the graduation. Two more weeks and all of this will be over. I would have graduated and finished my life as a student. No more suit, no more parties.

No. There will still be parties and suits. This is the last known event that I will have to attend. But what if somebody dies or even Luis' graduation a couple of months from now. I will have to wear something to it. I will be seen as his older brother.

Or will I? He will be graduating in July. I have my appointment in April. My parents have to know before my appointment. I can't deal with this on my own.

It feels as if I did something wrong. As if I did it behind their backs and I should confess a crime. Is that another reason why I am scared?

### 2016-02-20

The graduation is close. I told my parents I have almost everything for the process of the license. I just have to pay for the honorific mention and buy two or three tickets for the raffle. Yesterday, was it yesterday?, I saw again the job postulation asking for someone to contact and treat the patients. Register their treatment and process. I am a perfect fit for it. They haven't filled the position in one month. There must not be a lot of competition. It was new, less than a day of age.

I didn't apply. What of it scares me? That they'll ask me to wear a uniform? They'll ask me to cut my hair? They might ask me to ... There will be people with whom I'll have to socialize. In every job that's something that I'll need.

I looked about the people the Colef sponsors. Their jobs are given to students of bachelors or master. I have to be a student to be considered. So that closes that option.

There are job offerings looking for interns but those places are not paid. Am I scared? Why didn't I send the resume? Why does the idea of them calling me makes me nervous? The possibility of hiring me scares me. That's what I want, that's what I need.

Everyone has their job and position and something to do. I am lost.

What if my job impedes me to continue changing?

I have said that I'll wait after the graduation. I'll apply to almost everything that I can apply to after that. But what if I move the goalpost again after I reach it? I said I wouldn't look until new year's eve, then it was something else. Now is the graduation. Will the next one be the meeting with the endocrinologist?


It irritates me. It's frustrating. I feel impotent and useless.

I feel lonely again.

I used to wake up and distract myself with that weird anime of Utena and the duels in that school. The feminist anime full of symbolism. I ended it yesterday. Today I watched a movie about a comedian who gets pregnant and has an abortion.

I broke fast in the morning and returned to bed. Like those other days. I haven't showered since thursday. I can smell myself. I haven't shaved either since then. I should do it after finishing this. Maybe that will help me feel better. Cleaner. Spotless.

It's the weekend will somebody even see my resume? Will I be contacted? The last job I applied to didn't even called me back for a meeting.

I just need something until I can go and apply for the master. I have the project of Catherine's old therapist. I could talk about sexuality or attend patients. With a patient I would receive money. With the shops maybe I won't.

I have to contact her, too.

Anahi and Catherine made plans for next week. We could go to the beach Tuesday. It was accorded. We would meet then. I turned the phone and went back to bed. It will be hot those days. What if I would wear dress? Would I dare? Being out with them.

It's too soon. I'm rushing myself. Someone will react badly. I may be confronted or harassed. Am I not scared?

I could wear shorts and a blouse. Would I really? What is it with me and doing that? Doesn't it hurt?

No. It hurts not doing it. It hurts waking up and staying home all day. It hurts spending another day as Ivan. But dressing up and going outside is not the solution. They're just clothes. I am the same person. My beard still grows and my penis still hangs.

I feel lonely and I feel useless. What use does being a psychologist give me? What benefits do I get with going to Tecate to receive an award for my test results?

What's the point of having more than three hundred contacts in Facebook if I don't dare to publish the pictures I like?

Why don't I post them? Because people will see them. Isn't that the whole point of sharing them? Showing them?

What happens with them seeing them? They will know. They will see me. They will question me. They will talk.

They will know my secret. No. They will see them, will see me. They won't know a thing. It's just pictures. They will question or comment. They might laugh.

Am I scared of them laughing at what I like? Am I scared of people taking them away from me?

Am I scared of them not reacting? To them seeing them like a normal picture. Seeing Ivan in them.

### 2016-02-21

"I don't want to talk right now. Can we chat in the evening?"

I sent a text message to Lilliana and my curriculum in both English and Spanish to the scantibodies place.

I opened the word file of my resume and started translating it to English. I almost finished. I thought I did. Uploaded the files and clicked send. I still had the files opened when I realized a subtitle said "Logros". If I were recruiting for that place I would discard the resume instantly unless there were no other candidates. After one month the offer is still open. Either the salary is shit or they haven't find someone who can fulfill their needs.

I am overqualified to what they are looking. They want someone with a high school degree. I have a bachelors and experience with patients. And a degree more useful to them than an administering one. But I made a mistake. I wasn't going to apply anyway. It's the same. At least I tried. Now they can ignore me and I can count them as another place I contacted.

With Lili I have a meeting tomorrow. She will ask me my contact information and I will ask her about the details of the projects. She told Catherine to ask for my info. "Her name as is in her documents". Was that what hurt the most?

It actually should had eased everything. It settled that stuff. Now I knew that I was trying as Ivan. I was meeting her as Ivan and would apply as Ivan. Because that's the name in my documents, the name everybody knows me by.

That wasn't it. It sure helped but it wasn't the main issue.

The courses about sexuality probably won't be paid. I'll receive no remuneration. It would be better for me to take the patient. Practice therapy. I'd receive payment and supervision. I can use those hours as experience in individual therapy. The worst that can happen is a teenager abandoning the process. No, they could insult me or hit me or something excessive like that. But I'm not worried about those.

It should be the obvious choice. One, two sessions a week. Half of the paid would go as rent to the office. I'd pay the supervision with that money.

The other option, probably unpaid is the one that deals with more people. Is going to high schools and talk about sexuality. Teach about genitals and getting pregnant and how not. Talking about what I know, what I researched. What I obsessed with for a while. What I'm passionate about.

But they're teenagers. They will be whole groups of them. I am scared of them, of how they might react, what they might say or do. What they might see.

I'm scared of incarcerating in a project I won't be able to do. I'm scared of setting me into more time as Ivan.

But that's what will happen when I get a job. That's will happen whatever I decide.

Is that why I sent the message and set the meeting and sent the resume even though it scares me as much to see and talk with patients in that office?

I don't know when they'll contact me or even if they will. They might not. They probably won't.

With Liliana's project is just a day a week. Little pay. Doing something with my time. Am I able? Do I know enough? Can I do a good job?

"Did you fall asleep?" says the little pop up notification with Catherine's face. I abandoned her again. "What do I choose? What availability do I have?" She kept sending me messages with answers. Just one day a week. I can pick whatever I want, sure the sex courses probably won't be paid and the therapy will be almost nothing. She chose fridays because of her english classes. Was I upset because of the name? I should contact Lili myself and give her the information. I might set an appointment with her. I should tell her how the request of the name made me feel...

I couldn't. I wanted to cry. I felt the tears forming and my fears solidifying inside, like a dark fog taking form, filling me like a balloon ready to pop. I wanted to escape. I ran away. I hid the phone under my leg and kept watching the tv. I cried two single tears that nobody saw. The only one who know was Catherine because I wrote it to her.

Do I want anyone else to know? Did I want my mother who was doing the dishes to turn and notice? Notice the tears, notice me.

They won't come if I don't invite them. They won't come after a whole life of sending them away.

I need their help.

### 2016-02-22

I dreamed with Monica once again. She sent me a text message in whatsapp. There was this weird question that surfaced as soon as I saw her name in the notification. "What's the cause?" Why would she contact me? Is it my birthday, hers? We didn't talk in new year's nor christmas. I read the message and kept wondering about that: "Why?"

Yesterday I fell asleep with that thought in my mind. Asking her. Why can't I? I told her, proposed to her, to part our ways. Let's separate until you're ready. That was more than one hundred days ago. Do I have permission to contact her and ask her that? Is that really what I want? Just to know if he saw me. Yes or no. Would I leave it there? Of course not. I would continue, "Did he ask you something?, did you tell him something?"

And then? Would that be enough? "ok, thanks" and I'd leave for a hundred more days.

Does that change anything? I looked her up last time. I contacted her and mend the bridge. She wasn't ready and I was hurt. It should end there. I should had left her there, too.

I went to Liliana's office today. Catherine went to do her test. I put on the blue bra that I bought last week. I could wear whatever the fuck I want. There would be nobody home. No. That's not true. I left home after Miguel arrived.

I showered and shaved. I did my hair and put make up on. Almost nothing, just enough to be comfortable. I was wearing gray pants and a blue and gray shirt. I went to the closet and took the gray dress that Catherine gave me. I undressed in front of the mirror and wore it. Could I leave the house like this? My bare legs, my bare arms. It felt big. The part over my chest was baggy.

I didn't look bad. But I didn't feel comfortable enough to be outside like that. I know I'd be seen as a woman. Mostly. Maybe.

No. I would have to take extra clothes anyway. I am not ready to face my parents like that. It will be a thousand times easier telling them with my words than with my clothes.

Yesterday I felt bad thinking about this ambiguity that I can't escape from. I didn't use my name when I sent Lili a text. 'I'm Catherine's partner". I let her fill the blank.

"Do I have you on whatsapp or Facebook?" "Yes" She was looking for me. She hadn't found me yet.
"Ivan Fernandez?" Several times she had called me 'son' or used male pronouns. I wasn't wearing the dress but pants and a shirt.
"I have you as Sofi" and smiled. "Do you want me to have you as Ivan or is Sofi alright?" I smiled back. I felt shy. I asked her just like I did with Rene when he offered to treat me like Sofia. I said yes and smiled and felt a combination of shyness and joy.

We talked about her different projects. Psychotherapy, groups and talks about sexuality, talks about nutrition, evaluation of people. She even offered me giving me her archive of tests for me to do an investigation with it.

My face lightened up. I was interested. I wanted to. Of course I did.

Minutes after when I was already in my car on my way home, I felt different. Sure, there were something I could do. I might even gain some money from it. Why didn't it feel enough? What was lacking?

I would be doing research she talked about the possibility of actually presenting the results. And yet it felt wrong. It felt as if it wasn't what I wanted.

I want to do research. I like tests and data analysis. I like all those sort of things.

Except that is not the research that I want to do. There are thousands and thousands of papers of psychological tests. In Mexico, in Latino America in the whole word. With groups bigger, incomparably bigger than the one that I could muster.

No one, no body is doing the research that I have in mind. There are not as many papers about people like me. There is no research nor interest.

I could present the results and they would be more valuable. To society, to the medical community, to people like me.

I have to do it. I can't let it be just an idea.

This is what I'm meant to do.

### 2016-02-23

Yesterday I thought again about the possible projects of research I could do. Would I do a personal pencil and paper survey or an online one? Could I send the form to all the psychologists in Mexico? I could use it and disperse it by Facebook by the help of the contacts I have. I could send it by email to the psychologists in the lists of psychotherapists of the different schools.

I could do a lot of things. Interviews, focal groups, surveys. I could see myself presenting the results in a congress. Speaking in front of an auditory and talking, talking about the importance of it. Seeing how surprised I was by the results, seeing myself explaining how it's so important to do something to actualize the professionals in the right way of treating the trans community. I could make a workshop, I could organize a talk. I could do lot of things.

Would I do them as a trans person myself?

Would I say it in front of a crowd, would I wear woman's clothes and change my own voice when speaking? Would I enlist my name in the paper itself? Would I be questioned by the possible bias of the study by my participation? Would people applaud? Even though I am who I am.

I want to do it with Catherine. I want to meet her and talk about this. I could actually do this research in my own school. "Health sciences" is the name of the grad program. I might get it for free if I end up being Magna Cum Lavde.

Catherine asked me last night if I could go with her to her lab tests. I declined. I would had to wake up early and go pick her up and being ready. I ended up falling asleep past 3 in the morning. She had returned home when I had just opened my eyes.

Tomorrow I have a session with Rene. I may talk about this, my meeting with Liliana and her coming and forth with her way of calling me. I might talk about going to the US and not being recognized or introducing myself to the woman of the adults' school.

This project I have is like a little stone stuck in my shoe. I keep postponing it, though. I could be reading the book I downloaded or looking up information about qualitative research or more papers about the theme. Yet I have done nothing.

Three, four times was I called today by Telcel. They're not even my phone company and they're still irritating. I have blocked several numbers of them and they're still four of 6 contacts in the most frequent screen.

After therapy we might go to the movies. I wanted to wear something girly. I want to look feminine. I don't want to be seen as Ivan. Not anymore, I don't care about the ambiguity. I care about my family. I either put on something neutral with which I can return home or wear something daring that I'll end up changing outside the house before entering home.

I can show myself to the world but not to my family. The world keeps changing. The people who might judge me won't be there later. The sight of my parents and brother's reaction is not something that time itself will wash away.

No, it will. The thing is that I have to stay here and be witness of how the adapt. I actually will know what they will think or feel.

No, that's not true either. I won't know. Even know I don't know what they do know or ignore. I don't know what they intentionally miss or try to forget.

Rene was surprised by my thinking of my mother not remembering what I told her. It's easier for me, convincing myself that it didn't happen, that she forgot. It would be easier dealing with the comments she has made.

I hate her stupid joke of asking if someone is depressed. Miguel was serious and she questioned him if he had depression. I was just beside him but resisted to turn. She might have realized or she just might had continued as an act of routine. "Post-partum depression"

Yeah. Depression is possible. Is something that wanders in the house. It's necessary to take it to the impossible, the ridicule. The joke is you can't be pregnant. Har har.

I get irritated by what they do or say and yet I can't say anything myself. What the fuck is it that impedes me to open up?

If I stay shelled in my own secrecy I will rot.

### 2016-02-24

Today there was no confirmation.

I woke up almost 12 hours ago. I was dreaming something. There was some kind of hotel, and a group of people with me waiting in the bathroom. We needed to be ready for someplace. Catherine was the first to get into the shower. She was naked and didn't mind. There was another woman who was already undressing. Could I undress too? Did I feel like a woman or a man? I knew there I had a penis. Was I thinking of it or was I only shy?

I was brushing my teeth or something. I was rinsing my mouth with something. When I spat I opened my eyes and continue the action in my own pillow. Irritated I just pushed it away from me and returned to sleep. Not a lot after I woke up again and stayed awake.

What is it with me and bathrooms in my dreams? There is always a bathroom. The need to get ready for someplace and the pressure of time. It's been my morning routine almost all of my life. Waking up, getting ready, going somewhere.

There was a conversation with Catherine and Anahi. It was Catherine's first day at school. I was out of the shower when she texted me again to tell me her teacher was organizing a trip to San Diego Zoo.

I'm writing this words with an opened bottle of beer right in front of me. My teeth are pushing and screaming. I should had taken them out almost 5 years ago. The dentist warned me that it was dangerous leaving them in. They would ache and I would have to take them out anyway sooner or later.

There has been several times when a subtle notice grabs my attention. Like a little push to remind me they're there still. They scare me and by the next day the get quiet again.

Maybe it's the alcohol or the coldness of my drink. Maybe it's like Catherine said and just because we didn't kiss enough.

After the shower I tried the blue blouse I wore in the pride. It was wrinkled and I felt weird in it. Something about my chest or shoulders. Was my face ready then or was it before I did my hair?

Today I finished the first bottle of my pills. I have to remember to buy them again.

Next week is my graduation. I don't want it again. In the movie theater I told Catherine how I hadn't thunk about Luis' graduation. It will be in July. How will I go? Will I still go as Ivan? Will I dress differently? Present differently?

"My brother has long hair" "Does he?" "Yeah, he does". Will his conservative principal look at me funny? Will I go with a suit and tie?

There is a lot of time since then. And, unlike the time before this graduation, there are a lot of things that will happen before then.

Catherine was right. I don't even know how will my parents react. How will they act to how I dress or looks. To the changes that I'll experience. Even then, I don't really know if I will be able to take hormones and have those changes.

"Can you open this for me? ... Thanks"

Does he glance this way? Is he interested in what I write in here?

I haven't written about telling him nor my dad. My graduation is coming. I said I would tell them after it.

I wore a red long-sleeved t-shirt over the jeggings. I painted my lips red. I hid my eyes under the sunglasses. I walked to therapy and got in an oxxo before my session. "Sofiaa, I need your help". Is she mocking me? Is she being polite? Is it a game to her?

Why am I getting this defensive? When I read the text I felt excited and glad. Is it the beer?

I dropped a coin when I was putting my notes in my wallet. "Oh, I found 2 pesos" said the man who gave it to me. Was he being playful? Did he see me as a woman? Did anyone?

I met Catherine in Plaza Rio. "You've looked more feminine other times. You don't look as feminine, but you don't look masculine, either. I can't pinpoint what exactly is it. You really look neutral. I'm sorry"

Did it have something to do with this feeling?

We saw Room after eating a pizza in Food garden. I was excited and motivated telling her about my research project. What I plan, what I want to do.

There was a phone conversation that lasted a significant fraction of the movie, as well as a lot more than a handful of different ringtones that rang several times along the projection.

Catherine was tired. After picking up her dress I left her home. It's her first day and she walked a lot.

I am tired, too.




### 2016-02-25

"In that one you don't look like a woman. But yo do in this one" "I'm bisexual, no, trisexual: I am a man, a woman and a swagger"

Does he know what he is talking about? I know he's playing but he makes me nervous. What if he's like me? What if me coming out actually confuses him? Did I want to tell him when I was in bed laughing at his jokes? I pointed towards the box that is in front of my books. He read what it said and didn't get it at first. "It was my valentine's gift".

He opened the box to look inside. There are two kit kats but he didn't recognize them. He thought they were really condoms.

I woke up early today. I've been awake since 7 in the morning. I opened my eyes when my mom and he were getting ready to leave. Was she screaming? In the evening when they arrived before my dad, she had no voice left. As soon as the car drove off I got up and drove to the oxxo. I bought a small ginger ale and a large bottle of lemonade. I wanted to drink something sugary since yesterday. Now, after almost a liter of soda in the whole day, I regret it.

I was in pajamas when I paid. There was a young man paying in front of me. The cashier called him "young man" like 4 times. Yesterday I shaved. I was just up. Would he see me? How many times would he say it to me? I payed. He just used it once.

I watched a movie. True story. Jonah Hill and James Franco. A journalist interviewing a man who killed his wife and children. A psychological thriller. A half an hour episode of Law and Order, like one of the reviews wrote.

Yesterday's movie was different. I didn't have much expectations. I almost asked Catherine to see another one when we met. We cried when the mother finally was rescued by the police and ran towards her son in the patrol car. I felt the anxiety of the prep for his escape. I felt the sadness of the punches the questions of the interview gave them. I felt.

How many movies have I wasted not really feeling? Is this how everybody experiences cinema? Was Whiplash the first movie I really saw? How do people like going to the movies?

I downloaded a pdf reader in my tablet. I haven't opened the statistics book I downloaded in a lot of time. Yesterday I downloaded a manual for doing research protocols from the National University of Mexico. I can use it as a guide for my project.

When I was explaining my ideas to Catherine she confessed to me how she didn't really see me going to the schools and doing the survey. Sure, I would coordinate the project and organize it, but she couldn't really see me doing the field work. I know from where she was talking about. I know myself too. This was different though. I have thunk about it. I have considered calling or sending emails and presenting myself to the principals of schools, to the teachers.

The professors and students is even more feasible.

But that's not what I remembered. Afterwards, when I asked her which one of them would she like to do, she evaded the question. Doesn't she really want to do it with me? Maybe it isn't really her thing. It's ok.

I guess.

It was weird. We chatted a little in her breaks. After returning from the US, we haven't talked much. I actually have chatted more with Anahi than with her.

I went to my parents' closet and looked for my high school grad suit. Yesterday was, I think, when I commented it to her. I thought about not wearing a tie. I imagine myself with the suit of the wedding. But it doesn't really fit. It feels wrong. I saw the first five minutes of the next show that was recording. It was... I don't remember. There was this man with a suit, a three pieces suit, but he looked casual. He wasn't wearing a tie and hist shirt was open just over his waistcoat. I remembered my grad suit. I could use it. It would fit. A graduation suit. The first and last one I use.

Before the movies I thought about Luis' grad, too.

I sent her a picture of me with it. "I felt weird when I looked at the picture ... I liked it, it looked good, but it wasn't you."

She asked me, too, if I changed my voice yesterday. It was different. I did, but not totally. Today I heard myself. I downloaded a voice analyzer and a sound recorder. At first I read a fragment of Dorian Grey in my own voice. Then, I read it changing my voice. It marks if it sounds feminine, masculine or androgynous.

Even though it marks it, even though there is a confirmation, I can't allow myself to believe it.

Why?



### 2016-02-26

I can't stop thinking about that fucking question.

"In your place, I don't think I would be wearing the clothes outside, not yet. I couldn't deal with people wondering if I'm male or female, not until I had went to the laser or started the hormones and had physical changes. Not until I blended in." Don't I blend in?" "No, you don't." "So, how I look right now, it is not enough for you?" "It isn't enough".

I feel like she lied to me. It doesn't hurt because of what she said. It hurts me because of all that she has said before. I was fooled by her double standard. I look good enough to be outside and be seen, but only because it's me. If it were her, it wouldn't be enough. I don't blend. I don't look bad, but I still grab sights. "3 in 10 people, maybe, turn and wonder what you are. It's not that you look manly. There is something in you, something weird, that makes people doubt, you know? 'is that a man? Nah, or is it?' "

I was thinking about that conversation in argana in our way home. I felt like an idiot. I doubted everyone but her. Anahi, Liliana, Paola. How could anyone use that name if I look like a man still? She was the only one whom I trusted. I could had bet that she saw me as a woman. I was a woman to her. It threw me off when I realized that I haven't changed enough.

How can I ask them, then? How can I want to be called Sofia if I haven't changed? That was the whole fucking deal. I look like a man. When they used that name or feminine pronouns when I still look like this, it's a lie. It's a favor. It's because I wanted, because I asked it. I feel like a midget being called a giant. Just because of its good intentions doesn't make it less of an ironic mocking.

That's not the question that bugs me. That's not why I opened her stupid conversation and typed again, even though it won't change a fucking thing. It'll make things worse. If she doesn't answer, it'll be about her apathy. If she answers back, it will be her coldness or her hypocrisy. If I receive the answer I want I won't believe and if it isn't, I'll hate myself for even wonder it.

And yet again, here I am still seeing her fucking ghost. I won't let her die. She's gone. Why can't I just understand it and deal with her absence. She's gone, god damn it.

She left, I cried, it hurt. It's in the past. There it belongs.

I should worry about the future. I sent another CV. This one about tutorship to adults on their classes. I don't think I'll be contacted. It doesn't matter. I tried.

Catherine saw her patient today. She started the evaluation but won't be able to continue it. Their schedules don't match. They referred her to me. I felt envy of her case and now it's on my lap. I might receive just less than 10 bucks for my work but it's something.

Liliana asked Catherine to tell me to call her. I did. How should I introduce myself? Ivan or Sofia? Who the fuck am I?

She went ahead of me and addressed me even before I could open my mouth. "Sofi, how are you?" Later she sent me the contact info of the girl, and the hypothesis that I would investigate. I just had to schedule the meeting and tell her later about it.

I called her and she answered. I hadn't think about my past patients until later. She was in class. "Can I return your call? I'm in class and it's just started."

I packed the phone in my bag and finished getting ready. I wore my red pencil subtly in my lips. I wanted to look feminine. I failed.
"Do I look more or less feminine than when we went to the movies?" I saw the worry in her eyes before her answer. "Less" she said quickly to get over it. It didn't matter, whatever, I could take it. At least it's the truth.

There I remembered about the call and checked the phone. I had a missed call about 20 minutes earlier. I sent her a text so I would not interrupt another of her classes. She hasn't answered yet. TTomorrow I will call her again. Then I started to remember and worry. What if she abandons me, too? What is it with people leaving?

There was the woman who got angry when I turned in the street besides the fish place. She didn't address me in any way. I don't know what she saw. The only one who address us was the gum seller in the bay: "Misses, would you help me buying some gum...". It's the same man who tried to sell to me and Monica and later to Catherine and me. Now, it was the first time she met Sofia and Cathy.

Was he lying, too? Was he one of the 7 who sees me?

Do the strangers lie or they address me with kindness?

Will I escape the people who knows my past to surround me with strangers so that I can live with my persona hidden in a secret?

### 2016-02-27

It's almost midnight and I'm in bed. I have the phone next to my pillow. I'm not talking with Catherine, not tonight. In the computer I had the whatsapp site open. I looked for Monica's conversation and typed the damned question. I hesitated to click enter. I went to bed with that day's conversation still in mind. I have the question typed in Monica's conversation in my phone. I want to push enter. I want her to read it. I know she's online and won't see it until tomorrow, I don't care. I want to know. I want to know if he saw me. I want to know if I was recognized. His reaction won't be camouflaged in kindness. He hates me. I know how my friends react, people who love me, or claimed to, do. The reaction of someone who loathes me is invaluable, unbiased.

It would be a secret. I'm planning not to even mention Catherine. I won't mention the question, the hesitation. I don't even plan to say a word about her response. I think about possible answers. "No, he didn't." That would be it. All for nothing. "Yes, but he didn't recognize you" That's the one I hope for, but why? What does it change? It makes no difference and yet my heart starts running and fears that because of my anticipation it will never come. "Yes, he saw you and was surprised, he didn't say nothing" "...he said something". Would I ask her what was it? It would be an endless fall with no end. I would want to know what he said, and then, how she reacted, and then what she felt, and then how he answered back. Did she tell him something? Does he know now? Does her family?... That's what I fear. And then it comes. The most possible answer, the one that I don't expect and yet, after its arrival I would feel like an idiot for not seeing it come:

"I don't remember" "Ivan, don't start"

I throw the phone away and go to sleep.

It's nine o'clock. I went to the United States. I feel manly, freakish. I feel broken, betrayed. It's not that I think she let me down. I don't doubt what she told me. I doubt that I asked for the right information. She might have answered with the truth, but that's not what I wanted to know. It helped me shit that she sees me like a woman if nobody else does. How many times was I exposed and vulnerable? How many people didn't see me and thought ridicule of me? How many of them did laugh or pointed or avoided me?

I am a doubt. I am a freak. I have no changes. I have not changed physically at all.

Monica was a bitch because of her answer and yet I feel sorrow at cause of Catherine's opposite one. She sees me as a woman and I was fooled by it. I trusted my own false image. I let myself believe I was invisible.

How ridicule will I look when I tell my parents?

I thought about mentioning. I want to make an appointment to clean my facial hair with laser. I want to get rid of it. Why? Because I don't like it. I don't like it because it makes me look like a boy.

It was something to say. A little thing. I'm not asking them for money. I'm not asking them for permission. I am letting them know. I am sharing it. I couldn't open my mouth. Did they notice my silence? Does anyone ever?

I shared something else. I said how the guard didn't recognize me last time I crossed. I narrated the incident but omitted my outfit and my face. I left out the most important thing. "You know how sometims I wear make up? I wore it that day". My father would be furious. How could I be so foolish? What if they said something or took me to secondary inspection?

Why would I wear make up anyway?

"I would not risk being seen with that ambiguity. Knowing that I lie between a boy and a girl. I would not wear those clothes or make up, not until I had started changes"

I was angry and decided to know. I sent the question to Monica. And then I asked the same to Anahi. How do I look? I thought about telling Johanna, about sending another one-way letter to Helena. What do I care how they react? They are half a world away from me. They know almost nothing of me. They won't miss me. They won't note my absence.

I had no internet so I didn't.

I smiled with Anahi's response. It seemed honest and clumsy and sincere. And yet, was she really saying the truth? Can I really trust in the people who care?

### 2016-02-28

I'm full of energy and anxiety. My leg is restless and agitated. There is music in my ears but it doesn't calm me.

Many languages that I mostly don't understand. What was the last song in my own manner of speech? For a moment I forget it's spanish. I've lived where that tongue was born. I've stood in that country, in that city. I've seen the moon from that distant place.

Yesterday I thought about sending my secret towards there. I could tell Germany, I could tell Estonia. Did her mother die? Did she get a job or started her master?

Did Johanna ever wonder what caused my melancholy? Did Helena ever imagine my obsessive thoughts with her? One was way more obvious than the other.

I thought about sending her an audio message in her birthday. I didn't. Hers was little after mine. Helena was earlier, last year. Which could I tell first? Helena's reaction worries me less. I did kiss her, but maybe it actually never even happened. Johanna was closest and yet we haven't had a conversation in months, haven't heard her voice in years. What do I win telling them? Another person knowing, another one who knows before the ones who could actually help me. Another practice. Maybe that is it.

I asked her again. "How would you had told Paola?" "The same way you did, I guess". I remembered her my thoughts about her reaction. "I freaked out, sorry". I could ask Paola herself how did she take it. What were or are her thoughts. I could ask her Wednesday I will see her. I will deliver her book. I will see everybody again. All but Anahi.

Anahi is my best friend now. I asked her just as I did Monica. Monica is still silent, gone. Do I ignore her phantom or is it gone also? The times that I reluctantly go back to her conversation to see her last time online it marks the same way. Maybe she went out. Maybe she uninstalled the app. Maybe she ignored it. And yet again I am here writing about it, waiting, wondering and expecting. The answer will be trivial. Later I won't even remember it.

The Oscars were today. Leo won. I told Catherine how I didn't want Redmayne to win. I knew there would be stupid jokes in the internet. And then, when Leo's name was called and he gave his speech I thought about what would Eddie had said. Would I feel as Anahi felt with Lady Gaga's song about rape?

I was ignoring what was happening until I saw my phone and in it Anahi's crying emojis. I rewinded it and payed attention.

Weekend is almost over. My mother is alone in her bedroom and I'm here typing. Catherine and Anahi are both asleep. Eusebio didn't see my last messages. Maybe tomorrow I can message Paola and start a conversation. Follow Catherine's advice.

Next week, after graduation I will call and make an appointment in the laser place. I will have a "grad present' with that money maybe I could pay it myself. I should mention it to my parents. I don't want to go and talk to my mother now. I don't want to talk to her even more without saying a word to my father.

Catherine dreamed with me last night. We were in the movies and there was this game where you passed your phone. After the movie ended I realized I was phone-less. Catherine took it upon herself to go ask if someone had it. Everyone pointed towards the next person and she continued looking. Even I wasn't in the dream anymore. It was all about Catherine's search. A theater, even the swap meet where we went. Miguel, lastly Jhonny gave her a necklace which fit with something she already had. She felt relieved and woke up.

I interpreted her dream as her guilt over my "lost secret", she wanted to see who knew about me. Who could give me the answer and confidence I lost. At the end, she got a necklace instead, symbolizing our relationship.

Next week is the graduation. I will see the patient wednesday's morning and from there I'll go to my therapy. A day before I'll have my rehearsal. Thursday I'll pick the grad dress or however is called. Friday will be the ceremony and Saturday's evening the party. And then it will all be over. Will I tell them after it? Will I pick another late date or will it finally be it?

Will this desperation make me tell them even earlier?

"What did you do today?" "Nothing"

I really thought I had done nothing. I was wrong. I did a lot. I looked for people. I sent a message to Eusebio and talk almost more with Anahi than with Catherine. I started a conversation with Hilda. I opened up. I woke up late. It was past noon when I got up from bed. My dad was already home. Last night were just my mother and me. I think I heard her leave in the morning. I know I dreamed something but I can't recall anything from it.

I heard the door and the keys. I heard the footsteps climbing the stairs. I didn't know if it was Miguel or my dad until I went outside. "Have you eaten?" "No" "Do you want me to get you something?" "No, it's ok, I have something in here".

We were all alone today. It was like yesterday's evening when it was the perfect opportunity to bring the subject. He was lying in the couch and I was on the other one. There was no one else who could interrupt us or listen to it. I felt nervousness and my heart raced. I let it go. I let it escape. The moment passed.

That's when I took a shower. He picked up Miguel from college. I shaved both my legs and my face. I had cuts all over my shins. My face was smooth. I could had mentioned it. It didn't have to be about me or my gender or my appointment. It could be just mentioning my plans. "I'm thinking about looking for a laser treatment for my beard."

"Why?" "Why would yo do something like that?" They might laugh. They might mock.

Why do I want them both to be present?

Monica hasn't gone online. Sure I sent the message but I still avoid her. Why did I archived the conversation as soon as I touched send? What was I looking away from? What is it that I don't want to see? Whom do I want to convince that I don't care?

Catherine doesn't know. Nobody, not even she, knows that I sent it. The message left my phone but hasn't reached hers. It's still there, somewhere, floating, like a ghost.

I unarchived the conversation and let it be. Why should I be so afraid of it? It the answer really doesn't matter, then it won't change nothing. Then it has no importance.

Tomorrow it's the rehearsal of the grad. I'll meet Catherine in the afternoon in school. I'll drive and wait there. Tonight I will interpret some of her tests and look for other ones to apply. Maybe I can just use another session and finish. Less than an hour and I'll be paid 125 pesos.

Tomorrow I won't shave. I'll wear something normal. I should always be wearing something normal. I heard it, I learned it. I don't pass. I knew that already. She's right. She had told me before. Why did this time was different?

Why do I keep thinking about what to wear then? Why do I keep caring? I will wear the leggings. Will I? Will I meet my patient like that? "You can always just introduce yourself as Sofia the psychologist. You don't have to explain anything".

"You usually say your name before, though. It all depends." And yes it does. She already knows who I am. She knows my name. Will she know my face? Does it make a difference?

There was that microsoft page that guesses your age and gender with a picture. When I read about it, several people mentioned these other, more advanced sites. Face++ was one of them. Yesterday I looked for it. I saved a couple of pictures. One of my birthday, the one where I supposedly look like a teenager and the recent one.

One, the recent, the first I sent, said I was a boy with a 99.9% of certainty. It was a little hurting but it wasn't wrong. I couldn't be more objective than that. It had certainty degrees and a complicated algorithm and an unbiased non-feeling computer behind it. Catherine might lie, even unconsciously for my own sake. Anahi might lie for not hurting me. Strangers might condescend for kindness. But a computer doesn't care. A computer doesn't think or wonders, it just answers. Its task is to guess my age and gender and that's what it'll do.

The other ones said female with a more than 90% certainty. I didn't believe them either.


## March, 2016

### 2016-03-01

"Excited? ... Make use of it. I know you don't like being who you are not. I'm not telling you to enjoy when they call you Ivan, but, being honest, Ivan deserves a lot of things, too. I believe, from my humble opinion, a good bye?
And when you tell me I get a excited. When you say it's your last party that they'll celebrate with Ivan, I get excited about you, Sofia. "

Just know I shared with Catherine how I asked Anahi about how I looked those times I wore woman's clothes. I copied and pasted the first answer she gave me, warning me, making sure that I wouldn't take offense from it. I said I was going to the bathroom but in reality I went for something to drink. Tea this time. Now I don't want nor need alcohol.

I pasted her long "three thousand words essay". "Wow, how did it make you feel?".

Honestly, I don't know. It was nice. I would be lying if I had said that it was a relief or it wasn't the reason I am even considering wearing something feminine tomorrow. But that's not all of it. There was something else. An insecurity, maybe? A sick disbelief.

Today I dressed as masculine as I dared. "As masculine" I imagine with that answer dressing as the mid semesters from my career when I used formal pants and dark shirts. I dress as a caricature of an adult, an exaggeration of a man. I dressed like a little child trying to be his father. I was trying to be my dad. Being who he wanted me to? No, he never asked that from me. I wanted it.

I assimilated that expectation. I was the little boy who said he would be an engineer like his father. I would work with computers. I liked math and the sciences. I was excited to learn physics and chemistry. What happened then? I learned those subjects but didn't like them. They weren't what I expected? They failed me like I will fail my dad?

No.

In jr high I entered the electricity shop. It was full of men. I didn't dislike it, but didn't enjoy it either. I had my friend Medrano, and I wondered, I remember the choice. Communications or Electronics. Miguel chose that path. Miguel did follow my father's footsteps. I remember looking at them, chatting, ordering parts. My father was proud of him, helping him in his projects. He never did that with me. Was he disappointed as Medrano when I didn't went that way?

I followed Monica. It wasn't that I wanted to be with her. I wanted the chance to know her. Talk with her. To me, she wasn't Monica. I knew her name. But I didn't knew her. I chatted with her, had an idea of who she was. She was the X girl, to me. She was an avatar for the idealization of the persona I had created. She was the materialization of the femininity that I repressed and hid. I avoided being with men. I wanted a mixed group.

And then it happened. The first day when I didn't talk to her. No, that was what I believed. I did talk. I talk with her and Joanna and some other girls. I look in front of me, and behind me, all around me there were girls. And I didn't fit with them.

I didn't fit with men in jr high and I didn't fit with women then. I just didn't fit. I had chosen that path and I was lost and alone.

That was the trigger. Even Alan who moved to my class couldn't help me. I finally got close to her and could displace that femininity to her again. I fit the role of the male. I wasn't alone, I felt loved. I lived in my own fantasy bubble.

Today it was the rehearsal. I will be the first person in the line who will enter. I will come in and take my seat. Half of our generation behind me. "I thought about making my own speech". She rolled her eyes. It was like with Anahi and her, when I did their parts. It's not that I don't want you to do it. I did it for me. Anahi screamed and left. "It's for me". I said again.

Would I write it? Hilda told me her GPA is lower than me. I might be Magna Cum Laude. I might have a diploma and a postgraduate study free of charge.

But will I take it? It's like a safety net. I could stay here. Study some more. Do some more. Lose more time in this limbo. Or I could keep looking for a job, get out of here, travel and change my name. Be who I want to be. Be who I really am.

For that I have to have first to courage to say my name out loud.

### 2016-03-02

"Sofia has a face of not knowing"

I didn't expect it from her. Now that I write it, she's the person from whom I should had expected it most.

"I'll dress him very handsome for the graduation of his aunts"

It feels good but fake. An undeserved pleasure. I was driving home when I realized. I wonder about them believing my name because I don't. I fear of them thinking it's a game or a nickname, because I'm terrified of actually embracing it and make it mine. I am scared of having to fight for it. Defend it, defend me.

"Ivan, are there women who, you know, operate themselves, but, uh, like men who made themselves women, transexuals..." "Men who were born women? Yes, there are."

Why, why does he ask? What is it that gives him the curiosity?

The alarm clocked started singing at 6 in the morning. I could hear the showers upstairs. My dad was in the bathroom. I had no reason to get up then. I could wait. There was a second alarm. I stayed awake, anyway. I did shave. I did my hair. I wore a gray undershirt but took it off in my room. I wore pants but took them off too and put on the leggings. I looked myself in the mirror with my face shaven. It doesn't matter how close I do it, there is always dark spots. They always are seen.

I guess I do have to wear a mask.

I drove to Liliana's office. It was early. Catherine yesterday told me she was thinking about not going to school. She was in the border crossing line when I was getting ready. I arrived and looked for the guard in my male outfit. How much change could there be. I just had women's jeans and a clean face. Those were the only changes.

"Young man" he noticed me and opened the office. I waited there. It was early. Time caught up. It passed us. 15 minutes after our meeting time I sent Catherine a text. "What is it? Why me? What do I have that I can have a patient? Why do people don't give me a chance? She hasn't even seen me."

I thought she was inside the building or on her way to school. The patient said "Good morning" from the waiting room.

I applied the tests I carried and later did a short interview. She paid me. I left the money in her desk but it still was my first pay. I sent a text to Lili tonight, telling her about the money and the session. She asked how it went and told me her mother has a meeting next tuesday for the results. I offered to send her the report before printing and signing it. "If you like... thanks my beautiful girl".

Why did I feel warmth like with Paola's comment about her son's aunts? Why did I believe them and felt cared about? What is it? Why can't I see my own mother making some comments like that?

Is it really more difficult for them to accept it? To call me their daughter, to see my like a woman. To accept me and love me.

Catherine loves me as who I am. Anahi is my best friend, mutual, the first one, and cares for me the same way. Paola made the question about how to treat me. She changed the name and used it several times today. "I like your lip color" she said as she got there.

I returned from Liliana. I made breakfast and ate it. I applied make up before leaving but messed it up several times. Three times I had to color my lips. I try to sharpen the pencil's point and ended up using the lipstick.

"I had my first patient today" I started the session with Rene, "of course I wasn't wearing this".

Would had there been any difference with her? I would had a reason to attribute her absence. It's not logical because she wouldn't had known anyway, but still.

I felt peoples' sights all the way from my car to the building. Their eyes were heavy, like big and wet water balloons splashing me.

All the way back and the drive to the plaza. Chevo was already sitting waiting for us outside the movies. Catherine was sitting in her car parked with an empty spot besides her. I put make up again to cover the shadow in my face.

Nobody confirmed me today. There was no validation but Paola's different Sofias. Do they count?

Did Eusebio hear? The first one we were just the four of us. Then Jessica was there when she said I would roll the stairs. Did they notice? Do they care? Are they waiting for me to say something?

Should I wait after the graduation? We won't see each other until friday's ceremony and then it will be the party.

I will be dressed as a boy, I will be playing that character again, for the lasts times. What difference does it make?

Today. Today's feelings should had been difference enough. Is it really that I don't dare? I'm not courageous. I'm not brave. I am a coward.

I am fear materialized.

### 2016-03-03

There was something strange in today's morning sounds. I could hear my mother's voice at the same time of my dad's, Miguel and Luis were talking at the same time. The four of them were in the same room. Why was I awake? Did I dream something? I remember this weird sensation in my body. My head busy sorting thoughts. Separating fantasy from reality. Every morning is like a review of what has really happened and what has just been fiction.

The door was opened and the voices departed. I went back to slumber.

The door was opened again and there were steps around the house. Was Miguel home already? It was 9 in the morning. I think I checked the phone. It was my mother. Did she talk? Was it the phone? I realized it was her voice, her presence. What was she doing here? Whom did I tell? Catherine?

"My mother is here." I stood up and exited the room. My eyes were half-closed. "What happened?" I asked for a short answer and she narrated me her story. She has this, something, that she thought was hemorroids. They started growing so she went today to the hospital. The ER guy checked her. When he actually saw, he arranged her a meeting with the specialist. She has the meeting for the 7th.

Catherine offered me today of going to the movies, going to the hotel. I wouldn't shave today. I don't want to do anything of the sorts. I am not ok. I feel sad, I feel desperate and anxious. It's like time's running so fast around me, teasing him and I can't catch it. I'm dizzy with its motion and just want it to stop. At the same time I wish I just were as fast as it.

I wrote the time in the male persona. I went back to change it to the material it.

Several times I had thunk today about telling Catherine, asking her, not to talk until Sunday. After the party, after the ceremony. After all of this.

We went to pick up the, I don't know, graduation dress. Whatever it's called. She came for me after her salon. We picked the pictures. Asked for the different size. They did have ours saved in the system. It was just a matter of paying and waiting. He welcomed me with a young man. Of course he did. Now even a single day is enough for me to have a visible stub. I fantasize about plucking each and every one of those hairs. Feeling them hurt, grasping my skin and screaming as they let go. Enjoy the pain of their leaving.

Why haven't I made the appointment for the laser place? Is it really bigger the fear I have of telling my parents than the displeasure of being seen like this?

The next place was picking up the cloth. In the way, I saw a message of Melissa who said the ribbon would be given to us tomorrow. I had already saw how it was made. The psyches were red when they should had been yellow. The name is bigger and has a bigger psyche over it. The logo of the university is a green and ugly, the cloth itself is broader. The whole thing is a disaster.

Catherine felt even more distressed because she was the one who brought Ramon. She fears everyone will blame her. I just want all of this to end. I can't take it. I want to get over it. Sunday I'll have all of this behind me.

In her message Melissa said to take our id and an insurance of address. I didn't have any with me. Catherine either. There was a big notice posted in the wall saying they would ask for them with no exception.

The lady argue they told us when they gave us the receipt. They sure had given us that white paper. We had never seen it in our life. The lady who took our measures confessed, she didn't give us that paper, but she did say it. Maybe she did. I don't know.

They finally compromised and just check the address were the same as the one written in the receipt.

I tried it on. I didn't feel no excitement or fulfillment or emotion. It was a disguise. Another piece of cloth. Something to hid and go undetected.

We ate in the burger place near my house before picking the pictures. I thought I heard the waitress mix up her way to address me. It was an accident.

Outside my house, we kissed and touch. I put on a condom and we touched each other in the visitation parking.

I should interpret the tests, make the report. I've had a headache all day. I just want to lie down and sleep. Get over this.

Let it pass, let it end.

### 2016-03-04

"I have to go now. Sorry about my first message after all this time being about this, but I really wanted to know. I don't know how you are about me and everything that happened. You can talk to me if you want, or not. However, I understand. I hope you are all right."

"Pretties"
"Excuse me, girl"
"And academic mention to Ivan Fernandez for having the most perfect hair in this generation"
"I didn't recognize you with your flowing locks"

Today she had been online. I had already my clothes and broke fast. I was just waiting to leave. I was walking and opened her conversation. She was last online today in the morning. No. Before that I saw a red exclamation mark next to my message. It was not sent. I could click it to send it again. She had been online in the morning. She was alive. I had already checked.

Should I? Could I? Would I?

I touched it. And it came the first check, and then the second. I tried to hide my phone. I was scared, nervous. The message was received. Then they turned blue. A green Typing appeared under her name. Again I tried to lose the screen.

"red one, Sorry, I passed to leave Vania" "Okay, I'm doing my words." I wrote.

I made a mistake. It was the wrong conversation. Monica had not been online. It doesn't matter. She just wrote back. "How was it?"

I didn't really think she would write back. I saw it as closure. After the blue checks and time passed. I had, nothing. I just didn't expect.

In the morning. Her first message was an answer "no" and a disclaimer. Had I sent another messages? Her phone was stolen. She had just gotten whatsapp back. I had my answer. I didn't need nothing more. But I kept. And so did she. She talk as if nothing had happened. It hurt. Her message hurt. Why did I stay?

How are you? she asked. Did she really care?

I left. I sent her the message and I left.

I waited for Catherine in the plaza where Anahi goes to therapy. I had my gray pants and blue shirt and curly long hair. My face is clean. I looked manly. It was the beginning. I needed to get ready. These two days would be of closure.

Ramon took our pictures. There were some girls already there. Catherine was with Vania. She put on the grad dress and then I did. They gave us our ribbon and one by one we stepped for our picture. I went after Catherine. My pose would be different of theirs. He wanted me to cross my arms in front of me. Lift my chin and keep my back straight. The picture was taken and I saw it. It was good. It was fine. I didn't look like a man. I didn't look like Ivan. I looked... fine

After leaving. No. We waited. We waited until the matter of our party pictures was arranged. Hilda Catherine and me stayed there. Ramon took the camera and asked us to get together. We would have a special picture. "The gentleman in the midde". It was fine. These two days would be full with those kind of comments. I expected them. For now I was immune.

Hilda was by my left and Catherine to my right. "Closer... closer". I liked that picture.

When we leaved...


Catherine arrived. TOmorrow I will contine.

Sorry, this will end here.

### 2016-03-05

Sorry I'l have to cheat again.

In a couple of hours I will leave to the party. Liliana sent me text message asking how the report is going. I freaked out and told her I would have it by tomorrow. Now, I have to write the words, too, but I think I will just cheat today.

Yesterday I went with my parents to Cheripan, the argentinian restuarant. My mother ordered a choripan while I asked for a churrasco. I didn't drink anything. I would drink plenty today. After returning, Catherine sent me a text. Could I go out? She felt as if we didn't spent enough time just the two of us.

I remember the pictures. I liked them. I looked fine. We looked equal.

Now I am wearing my tux and I won't look the same. "Congratulations to the two bachelors" (in the male neutral). I wanted to correct her. I didn't. Just one more day. Just today.

My father had asked me the same question. Was I planning on going somewhere else after dinner? I answered no. I really had no plans. So when Catherine asked I hesitated. I did want to go. I could use a drink. I went upstairs to my parents' room and started innocuous conversation before telling them about leaving. They almost convinced me of going. I tend to do that with them. Looking indecisive so they push me into doing what I want do, instead of me asking permission.

I can't do that with my situation.

And I kept writing instead of grading the test.

Catherine drove me to plaza Fiesta. We could go to El tigre or Zenzontle. It was full. It was filled with people. We walked a little but ended up deciding to go somewhere else. We could drive a little to Paseo Chapultepec, they had some nice places and we were already dressed nice.

1994 was the place where we went. That cozy bar where we met with the rest of the group. We stayed there for a while. After our liter she drove me home.

No, it was when we arrived to the parking lot. She was looking for an empty slot when the car in front of us put on its reverse lights. She stopped and waited. The car came to us closer and closer. She honked but it was still coming. She honked again and again. until the rear met us in a crash. She kept honking out of desperation. She opened the door and got out. The driver of the white car did the same. He was an american. They saw there was no damage done so it all ended there. The guy would let us the empty spot he found a little while later.

I went to sleep. She slept with my long red sweater.

Today in the morning after breakfast I took the robe and little funny hat and returned them. I could stop somewhere and buy a nice spaniard wine. There was a licor shop near the place of the rent of tuxedos. I didn't find it. After returning the clothes and getting my id back, I went towards Galerias plaza. Wal-mart. I found a bottle of wine from 5 years ago. The same year we entered school. I also bought a bottle of asturian sidra.

I am all dressed and ready with my words almost finished and the tests still unchecked. I haven't written a single word of the report and yet I told "my boss" I would have it by tomorrow. While in a couple of hours I'll go to my graduation party and won't come back until after 2 in the morning.

I made the same mistake again today. Catherine had asked me at what time would I tell my parents to go take our picture. I wrote "near 6, I guess" but sent it to the wrong conversation.

It's the second time. It was a coincidence, and yet it still seems wrong.

She returned yesterday after my calling of the obvious. Hey* she corrected. She came back. I, instead of hating her, hated myself. Why did I put myself in that place again? And after the superficial conversation I ended with a pathetic request. "Don't be a stranger, ok?"

That's what she is.

No. She has always been Monica. All of her life she's stayed the same way. I hadn't met her when I saw her as the nameless girl. Then I idolized her. Then I really got to know her. But she's been the same person.

I am the one who changed. I am the one who is a stranger to her.

After my mistake she saw it but said nothing.

Now I did archived her conversation. I won't make the same mistake and I can stop looking at her picture if the silence returns.

### 2016-03-06

It's done. It's over. I'm finished with school. Well, not really, I mean, I still have to go and actually do the procedure to get my license. But, I gave my parents their party. I wore the tuxedo. I went and took the picture with them. I danced with Catherine. I laughed and drank with my friends.

"There's no shame in being tired (feminine)"

The last letters were off screen but I know what she wrote. I was there. She asked me if I wanted it that way. I did. She published it.

Everyone took pictures and videos. We all had a good time. A couple of flashing moments of real feeling struck me several times in the night. I drowned them in alcohol. For once it actually worked. I went ahead and got in line in the last assistance list. We made a toast. It didn't count towards the challenge I had with Chevo and Paola. Everyone in the table knew about me. Jhonny hadn't arrived yet. Yarely's boyfriend ignores my story, too, I guess.

"The most beautiful hair in the faculty" greeted me Viramontes when I met him outside the bathroom.

"Isn't he handsome, that cabron?", said again to the group of people he was with when I exited other time. Was it the time when I couldn't control my breathing inside the cubicle?

I remember thinking about how I had the escape plan ready. I could go with my parents and ask them to leave whenever I felt anxious or dysphoric. In the afternoon when I put on the suit and was grading the tests it was heavy and uncomfortable. It was like a cage, constricting me, asphyxiating me.

I remember seeing the pictures of Ramon and liking them. I was surprised of how good I looked. Even though I was a man, I could see me in those eyes and that smile.

In the party I got desperate with the absence of organization. There was no map of tables. We didn't know which was our table, where could we sit? What would I do? Claudia had the list, I guess, but she didn't publish it. One by one she was saying their tables as we asked. Catherine was in her way.

I met Chevica for the second time that day. I sat with them in Catherine's table. I saw Luis sitting bored, listening to music, quiet. Why was I sad about him? I felt like I had abandoned him. Inviting him felt like a punishment.

One by one I destroyed my suit. First it was the coat, after that, the tie. Then, after midnight, I took off my vest.

Where would we go as an after-party? Jhonny asked us. Paola had already said we could go take a shot to finish the day. I didn't want to say no. I wanted to go, but how could I? My parents would wait for me? Would they take me or pick me up? I didn't want to ask permission. After the party ended, they said we should go ask. I did. At first my parents didn't know what to do. Where would I go? Was it far? Would they wait for me? Could they?

Then, Catherine asked their parents if they could drive me home so my parents could go their way. They said yes. I asked her if she was sure. When I told my dad, he asked me the same question. Sure. They would take me. It was all set.

Except that it wasn't really the plan. Jhonny wanted us to stay in his house. When he said that I thought there would be more of us. He did sit with Miguel. He stayed with him and danced with him, chatted with him. We joked about him, how Miguel was waiting for him. He had left him all alone.

We had to go so Miguel would go, too. Catherine could ask her parents but I would need to, first. In one of the videos they took, I can see myself in the phone talking with my mother, asking her permission. "Who is this jhonny? Was he with you in the table? Where does he live?"

It's just the second time that I stay in somebody's house, and yet to my parents I've done it a lot more.

I had their yes. After another call, Catherine had hers.

We drank the shot. And then, Paola asked me to drink the absynth one. The didn't have it. So we ordered a similar one. Then the bartender gave the girls a free one.

Jessica passed hers to me and I gave the little glass back empty to her.

I went to the bathroom. Paolas went first. Paola was drunk as hell. She was literally speaking in english. Paola called an uber to pick them up. Later I would know paola's mother would intercept it and take Paola to the hospital. She was that drunk.

We went to a karaoke and drank a beer. Jhonny sang. We ate hot dogs in the dawn and took a taxi to jhonny's apartment. I undressed and slept in his spare room with Catherine.

I told her I loved her.

We had sex and my foreskin got stuck. Catherine would hear the sounds of the bed in the other room.

"Our little kid will have your name" he told me last night.

"Ivan... and if it's a girl?"

"Sofia" I wanted to tell him.

Now there is no reason to not tell my parents. If I hadn't gone, I actually think I would had done it.

### 2016-03-07

The gas dispatcher welcomed us in the feminine form. He didn't correct himself after, but then again I don't know what he saw. If it wasn't for his word I would never had known anyway.

Does it change anything? Is there like a meter that measures the number of people who sees me in a certain way? Under a certain number I don't qualify as being a woman.

I wasn't going to do anything today. I sent a text message in the morning to Lili. She answered almost instantly. I could send her the report by whatsapp so she would read it so I can present it to the patient tomorrow. After the link I got nothing back. I went back to sleep and didn't get up from bed until almost noon. I remember a couple of nightmares. They weren't the usual ones of a catastrophe or a interpersonal conflict. They were surreal. I knew I was dreaming. I found myself in this kind of mansion where I of course knew terrible things were gonna happen. I saw myself and tried to wake up. I tried to take control of the dream. I could turn the lights on, I could get away. It was my mind that created everything. I could do whatever I wanted. Except I didn't.

I woke up and fell asleep again. I fooled myself into thinking I was safe in reality. And then a glimpse of failed imitation of physics or a realization that the clothes I were wearing were not right with the moment would bring me back to my panic and frustration.

Yesterday I worried that I would not be able to sleep in the night. I fell asleep without a problem and continued to do until noon.

Miguel got in early. He opened the door and went upstairs. Catherine was answering my question about how were we going to resolve signing the report. She had returned already from the doctor so she offered me to go and eat in her house. I didn't want to get ready. I didn't want to change clothes. I didn't even want to shower. So Miguel's request made everything easier. "Could you give a ride to the sports unit?"

It was pouring and yet the kid wanted to do some exercise. I went and showered. Sure. Little balls of ice trickled in my windshield when I parked to leave him. I arrived in Catherine's house with the tank almost empty. She had no white sheets into which to print our report.

"Hello, tal-Ivan" said his father. He smiled and joked, he's kind with me. Her mother is the one who made a face when Catherine's aunt asked her to take a picture with me. She's the one who doesn't like me the same way after knowing about me. Maybe with his father will be similar. Maybe he'll resent me for being a freak who is in love with his daughter.

We went to fill the tank after eating the soup. Then Soriana. I told Catherine about Monica's messages. "Answer mee" she had said. Why was I talking to her? Was I betraying my own feelings?

Why did I think about asking her about my francs? She didn't give them to me for a reason. It was a way to start the conversation. When I told Catherine I really didn't remember how she came from the archived conversation after my mistake.

I archived her now again.

"Have you spend my francs?" "No"
"Not even in gambling and skanks?" "No"
"Lame"

Three times. Three messages and two nos. I talked with Catherine how I made a mistake continuing her conversation and I was here again, starting it. And for what? A couple of european coins.

Catherine's phone rang as we stopped in front of her house. Her parents would go to the doctor. While their absence we fucked on her bed. The trojan condom felt weird. I remember how it was the only one which I could actually wear and now it was loose and ill-fitting.

We went downstairs and watched the movie Zoolander. I fell asleep on her shoulder. I hugged her and kissed her.

We had just signed our first report as psychologists. It felt weird when I finally got an answer from Liliana. I had to change my own conclusions. I imagined she wouldn't want me to put a diagnostic on. The therapy recommendations were off, too.

What if she just wanted the results? What if my "good job" was not enough?

Maybe my work is just wrong?

It feels weak, poorly supported. Maybe my whole thing about doing everything perfect is because I don't value myself?

At least I hope I will get paid.

### 2016-03-08

Since last week that I saw the patient I have not written in the journal. The last time that I attempted to fill a notebook was with the university's planner that I bought in the gift shop. I used it for a couple of months and then forgot about it. Left it there, grouping blank days.

Now I have this little notebook that I bought with Catherine the day that we saw The Danish Girl. It was February? Now I have a blank week that I want to fill.

Will I be able to remember what I've done? What have I done this week? I saw my first paid patient. I applied test in a professional setting for the first time. That day was my last session with Rene. I came home and changed clothes. Was that the day that I met with Paola and Chevo and Jessica? Yeah, I think so.

"I like your lip's color" She called me Sofia twice.

This weekend Lili texted me to see how we were going with the report. I panicked and said I would have it by Sunday.

And I did. I had it. Now, today, I delivered it. I dressed nicely if I had to meet with the patient's mother. She wasn't there. I was sharing Lili's session. She asked for my input. I delivered results, handed her the report.

By the end of it I had my feedback. I am a charismatic, empathetic, glowing. "How many times have you done this before?" It was actually my first and I said the truth. Did she expect it? Maybe she could see where I lacked. Maybe I seemed knowing and experienced.

She kept talking about this other project. A workshop about tests. At first I believed it was about Catherine and me giving it. No, she wants us to take it. Maybe then we could have more patients. Where will I get patients? Now it's not that I don't believe I'm ready. It's not the knowledge that I lack, it's the patients. The thought about paying for them to teach me more sickens me. More even that they expect me to get patients so I can pay them.

I got stuck in traffic on the way home. Was that it? Was it meeting Ana Karen? She hugged me and said hi. "He also graduated". Did she know I've met Liliana? Maybe she left with the idea I'm another of her patients.

"Erick" "Erick" "...Ivan". She apologized. I'm not Erick, but I'm not Ivan, either.

She called me several different nicknames, petnames along the session and the feedback. All her adjectives were male. Of course they were. I presented that way.

I can think of me, imagine myself and I don't cringe anymore. Do I?

Why did that picture came to mind? The one I took outside Rene's office. I don't like my face. I don't like my complexion nor lips. It was that same day, the same one of my meetings.

...So I came home after 40 minutes. And when I arrive to the private, I can see my father's pick up. It fills me with rage. I couldn't get before him. Now I have to park outside him and came all the way in, look for him and ask him if he wants to move the cars, return and move back so he can get out, get the car in and wait for him. Then I can come home and get in.

It irritates me even more how I can sense they are in the living room. They are not far from the door and yet, knowing I've arrived, hearing how I fumble with the keys, they stay where they are.

I come in Miguel is lying in the couch. My parents were in the table. Just seeing me enter my father asks "let's move the cars".

I threw the stuff in my bed and returned to my car. When I put reverse, I almost kicked the pedal so I would crash with the gate. I'm furious. What is it? What was it?

I come back and eat, again, for the third time. Even after my salad I would go to the fridge and grab a hot dog and a bologna.

Today I had another dream. Catherine told me how since Sunday I've been uneasy in my sleep. Yesterday it was about how I couldn't get out of my dream. Today I defended some movie's character and got confronted with the bigot's doubt. Why was I caring? He grabbed my hands and looked at me suspicious. I feared he would move them to my chest, feel my bra, know about me, hit me, do something.

It wasn't any bigot. It was Nicolai. Jaime Nicolai from grade school. I didn't tell Catherine that, she doesn't know about him. There is nothing to know about him. I haven't seen him in more than 10 years. There is nothing from the time I knew him that could even relate to this.

What does he have to do with my fear of judgement? With my frustration of not being able to wake up from this nightmare?

### 2016-03-09

I haven't started.

I was dreaming and yet I knew it. I tried to control it again, but failed. I could use the opportunity to tell my dad. He was driving. We were in a mall. Outside Target, there were no other stores, just houses. Houses, again, just like the mansion in that other dream I could not control.

I would later narrate my dream to Rene. The second, most important part. I was more conscious about my being inside a lucid dream. I entered voluntarily to the house. I knew I could control it, make my mom appear. I went upstairs. Outside there was a three plants house, in the inside it was endless. Several different rooms, connectors and stairs. Inside them there were numerous and infinite rooms. Huge, gigantic furniture. I looked for a more normal one. I'd later find it and lie on the bed.

I made my mother appear in the room. Inside, she wasn't my mom. "My mom is not my favorite person in the world and yet the person in front of me wasn't her. It was even less." I called for my real mom and another one appeared. She also wasn't and my mind asked for another. Again, a third person entered. I was sick of it and blurted it out. "I'm trans". There, it was out. Nothing would happen when I would wake up. It was a no-consequence-exercise.

I can't even remember how she reacted. Was she surprised, angry? Was she disbelieving?

Nothing came out of it and I finally woke up.

I could interpret the other ones from earlier nights, bu this one? What could this one mean?

"Well, wasn't it what really happened?"

"You wanted your "perfect" mother to appear and she never did. You told her and nothing came out of it. An yet, the interesting part was that even in a dream you couldn't tell your dad, the one who you want to tell the most".

Today I didn't cried, just listened.

I shaved in the shower with the cheap razor. The one with which I shaved my legs. They're smooth now. I can't remember the last time I did it. It's a subtle little difference.

I applied make up and looked fine. I picked Catherine from near the crossing border. She had bought two tacos for sharing. I drove to Playas. A movie and then our cafe.

We ate the tacos, but where? In the movies? Yeah, in the parking lot. We bought the tickets to Zoolander 2. I laughed. I hugged her. She put her hand inside my leggings.

From there I parked near the park so she could apply more make up to my face and cover my facial hair. I applied the pencil instead of the lipstick. She put the foundation so I wouldn't have to see my face.

In the cafe I don't know if I were recognized. The new waitresses don't know us. There is just one from before we left the country two years ago. She gave us our menus and forgot about us until Catherine went down to order. The other waitress would constantly come upstairs to ask us how we were and if we needed anything.

We took pictures and videos. I shared some of them in snapchat. Sent them to Chevo and Paolas and Anahi.

We were talking with Anahi about tomorrow. What would I wear? How would we cross. What could we do with the cars? Anahi would cross in her car from otay. And us? what would we do when we return later at night? I have to take my car so I could return home. I will drive myself to San Ysidro and cross with the sentri card. They will cross in Otay and meet me in San Ysidro.

Today we also talked about that night. The sunday I slept with Catherine and talked drunk after having sex. I told her I loved her. I do. I know it. I don't doubt it. She told what I also said.

"After that, yeah, I felt this butterflies in my stomach. But I freaked out a little. It was more about what you said later. I haven't mentioned it."

I didn't know what else I said. She had told me about how I kept playing with jhonny about having sex. Was I teasing him? Didn't I really care? I can't remember that just as I can't remember me saying

"I want to have... ok, adopt, little babies", with a playful, childish and almost unconscious smile.

### 2016-03-10

Today we had sex. A thousand times I've said that I won't be able to have children. Yesterday we talked about how I said in a drunken state of consciousness how I'd be willing to have, or, more like, adopt children with her.

My father woke me up at 5:30 in the morning. The bathroom was ready. I shaved part of my chest and cleaned my hair. I put on pants and shaved my face with the double edged razor. It was close enough. I didn't put neither the bra nor the t-shirt. I went downstairs to my room with both my pajama pants and the clothes I'd wear today in my arms. In my room I had to lock the door so Luis wouldn't enter and see me. I painted my face and put mousse on my hair. Just a little black in my eyes and something to cover my facial hair.

Then I exited. Catherine and Anahi were already 20 persons behind crossing. I was in my car 5 minutes before the time I had to be leaving. There was traffic down the 5&10. I got into the gas station and went another way. There was some traffic too getting down the Americas. Down to the boulevard there was a full-stop. A couple more minutes in the 20 de noviembre neighborhood. After getting in to the freeway there was no more traffic. I parked the car and actually ran to the line. I showed my sentri card and got in the building. I kept walking until I stood a couple of persons behind the counter. Again the border officer held my card at the same lever of my face to corroborate my image. This time he didn't say anything. "Yes, it's you" He mumbled something I didn't get. "Your bag, what do you bring from Mexico" "Nothing."

I waited for Catherine and Anahi to come pick me up in the Jack in the box.

Anahi drove us to the Zoo. We got in there on time. We actually were early. We waited until some other people arrived.

How did they see me? There was someone who called us ladies. This time Catherine and Anahi weren't in front. If he didn't see the three of us, then he saw me with Anahi. I wanted to go to the bathroom. My underwear was uncomfortable. Where should I go? Partially blending is not really a solution. It has its own drawbacks. Getting in to the men's one would be admitting failure. The women's was overconfidence.

I waited. The next time we stopped, when Anahi did enter, I asked Catherine. "Which one should I use?" "You don't look girly girly", she admitted with a worried look on her face. I couldn't hear the rest of it. Her words were silent. I just caught her personification of manly man. "You are not a manly man". I don't care about extremes. I just want to avoid this ambiguity.

I can't remember now much of the zoo. We saw some animals, we went into the sky boxes thingies.

I wanted fish & chips, but the food was really expensive. It would be better for us to eat somewhere else. In n out? Chipotle?

"los llevo" "morros" "mamon". Why would those hurt me? She told Catherine she sees me as a woman. She calls me Sofia. I have seen the picture. She has me by that name in her phone. She's sincere. They're just mistakes, slips of tongue. Why do they hurt? I feel so pathetic worrying and hurting about that nonsense.

She drove us to the border and we walked towards my car. I used the men's room and she the women's. There was just one bathroom.

We could go fucking. We could go to the movies, too. We stopped in the Love boutique near my house. The lady in the cashier welcomed us with doubt. How did she end her word? "Bienvenid..." and then a whisper. Is it their voices that goes off or is it my ears that shut?

"Cualquier cosa diganme, reinas", said the older woman by her side. I didn't want to turn. I didn't want to face her. I liked being noticed, called like this. I don't want them to correct themselves. I don't want to correct them a third time. I've never done that.

In the motel I finished four times. The condom slipped and ended up inside of her. We were nervous, a little scared. I drove her to the pharmacy and bought an emergency pill.

My blue bra is damned. Everytime that I would use it, I wasn't able to show it to her. And then, today that we actually went to a motel, the condom slips. And after leaving, I think I forgot it. It wasn't until we were outside her house when I looked for her camera in my bag that I had to move it. I had put it in. I still have it.

We did what we had to. She took the pill. Now we just have to wait. Let her period come. She had her last between the 20th and 24th. Two weeks until the next one.

Two weeks and I can stop worrying about that. Two weeks after that and I'll worry about going to my appointment.

### 2016-03-11

I asked Cahterine to go to the university today. I could had gone alone. Nothing impeded me. Why didn't I go by myself? I stayed in bed. I slept the hours I lacked yesterday. I enjoyed my free time in bed, the warm between my sheets, the softness of my pillows, the rest in my muted thoughts.

This morning I did broke fast eating a bowl of cereal. The sweetness of the food was something new. A couple hours later I ate a sandwich and some chips. I watched several episodes of House of Cards. From bed to the couch. Walking nothing more than the necessary. My legs still hurt from yesterday's trip. The photos finished uploading. Even the videos are now in my computer. I could spend some time organizing most of them. Seeing them.

Catherine and Anahi published several on the internet.

"Is it bad that I'm a little annoyed with Anahi?" Catherine asked me a little ago. Yesterday in the Zoo Anahi avoided the camera, made faces when we still shoot at her. I kept doing it. I don't mind she doesn't like them. I want them for me. Still, when I got home, the first thing she did was ask us for the pictures we take. The contradiction made Catherine feel uneasy. I've gotten used to it, I guess. I noticed it, but didn't mind.

I like the pictures of that day, the ones from the day before. I like looking at me. Seeing me smile. I feel a little as if I want to share them, show them to my friends, post them on Facebook and let the world see me, see how I'm able to smile and be happy. I want to look at me, to notice me. I guess that's why I feel sad when I do post them and almost nobody notices them. There is no reaction. Nobody cares, why would they?

Why haven't I told my dad? The graduation has passed. It's not his reaction that I fear, it's not his face either. It's not his disappointment nor anger. It's not even his pain. What is it that scares me?

I don't know how to say it.

Yes, I do.

"Dad, I'm trans". That's what I have to say. Anything else is just an explanation. I can ease into it. I know that, too. Bring the topic up: "Have you seen that they're now the Wachowski sisters?". Let him talk about it. If he's supportive just say it. If he's not, say it even with more reason. "Everyone can be. Most of the people would never now".

I know what to say. I don't fear the reaction anymore. I just don't know how. How can I get close? How can I bring it up?

I told Catherine how I felt when I was in her house the last time. Being called Ivan, hearing the same old joke about that name.

Her mother invited me to the wedding of one of her friends. She hadn't told me about it. She didn't know if she should. How would I feel? Would I go?

I was honest with her. I'm not thrilled with the idea. I don't want to wear a suit. Introduce myself in that name. Play that role again. She understands. She knows. "It's just that, it was the first time that my mother mentioned taking you somewhere".

It was, except it wasn't. She wasn't inviting me. They don't know me.

Not even my parents know me. It's not fair to give Catherine pressure to do something when I can't even make myself open up. My parents are now alone in the kitchen. I don't even bother anymore making me feel guilty about the passed opportunities. I won't do it soon. I don't know what I am waiting for. Whenever they see something or ask about something will I admit it?

There are pictures of me in my computer, clothes of mine in my room. There is make up in my shelf. There is profiles with my picture and name online. What will happen when the wrong person finds them and says something? What when my aunts notice my name change in snapchat? What will I do when I meet Jessica and or her parents in the movies or when somebody who knows my mother recognizes me with the wrong clothes walking to my therapy?

What will happen when I make the appointment and finally go to the laser place. Will I tell them before? Will I tell them after? Will I answer truthfully when they will ask me?

Will I lie?

Will I ever be able to stop lying?

### 2016-03-12

Tomorrow I'll run a 5km race. It will be like the first date I went with Catherine three years ago. Now, everyone of us but Anahi will be there. Colors, water, running. I have the clothes ready in my bed. I asked Luis for a white t-shirt.

I got distracted. I was chatting with Catherine and Anahi. Anahi asked me where was Catherine, if I was with her. She's in a wedding. She did invite me. I decided not to go. I didn't want to wear a suit and meet people. I don't want to dance I don't want to be around people and feel invisible and hidden.

Ironically I was just talking with Anahi about going somewhere to dance. She doesn't know about any place and neither do I. After I mentioned our conversation to Catherine, she told me she doesn't know either. I think about the differences between dancing clubs and bars. I like the latter, but the former make me nervous. I think about the line that forms outside the door. The security men with their chains who decide who enters and who doesn't. How would I dress? They would look at my clothes, judge me, evaluate me. Am I formal enough? What would happen if I decided to go differently? Would I obliged to wear pants and shoes and a shirt?

Would I be mocked when I showed my id to those people? Do I have to go as a man? Would I dare going as something else?

Rene told me last session he should be starting with my report. If I wanted something special. What could I ask him to write? Does he really think the treatment is the right thing for me? I know it is. I know I am convinced. But is he on the same page as me? Do I have his total support?

I can ask him to put in what I have done, the things I've accomplished. I've told my close friends. I have a partner who knows and supports me and loves me just as I am. I've told my mother. I've gone outside several times dressed as female. I've known for years now.

Writing those things made me nervous. I feel agitated and anxious. I haven't told my dad. I haven't asked all of my friends to really acknowledge me. I haven't found a job with which I could live. I haven't started the laser sessions. I haven't told my brothers. I haven't confided in more than a handful of people.

I think about what I've done and I can't help but run towards I haven't done yet. What I'm missing, what I don't dare.

And time keeps coming, it runs and runs and it's closer than ever. Two months have passed since my birthday. Two months since I did the appointment, since I dared to make the call. Two months and nothing has happened since then. No. I'm lying.

Paolas know. Paola knows, Paola knows my name and about me. I've shared more with them. I graduated. I'm done with school.

I'm closer with Luis, I guess?

I won't tell him until I tell my dad. I think again and again how I could approach him. I go blank. My mouth is shut, my throat closed and my mind empty.

Tomorrow I'll wake up early and run. Tomorrow I'll see them. Will I say anything? What's the point in telling them more when my father is still blank?

Monday I can go to school and keep doing all the bureaucratic procedure that I left undone. I have the pictures and I've paid what I had to pay. Paola still has the book I took out for her. I need her to return it so they can give me a paper that says I don't owe anything to them.

Catherine gave me a convocation to this scholarship of community work in Colombia and Chile. I had seen it. When I gave myself the time to actually read it, something in it made me uneasy. I had to have and propose this new and creative idea of something that could help the community. Do a video of me selling it and promoting it.

I gave up without even trying.

I should be studying, preparing for my own goal. I haven't opened any of the books I should be reading.

I must call to the laser place. Catherine is right. Is just a consult. Asking about prices and terms. I'm not signing anything. I'm just asking. I can do that and then talk about my parents. Why do I keep feeling I'm hiding it from them. That I'm betraying them.

I can tell them that I went and asked. I want to do this.

"Why?"

Because I don't like how I look with facial hair. I don't like looking like a man. I don't like being a man...

And then just take the jump. Close my eyes and take that leap of faith. In the air, it doesn't matter the coldness of the water or the frozen punch of the fall. There's nothing left to do but embrace it.

### 2016-03-13

My eyes are heavy and tired. They are aching for closing and rest. My whole body is restless. I turn and see my bed and I'm filled with this sense of longing. The desire to crawl to there, hid under the sheets and turn off the lights is almost unbearable.

Yesterday I turned off the setting of my cellphone which automatically sets the time and date with the data sent by my cell provider and/or the information on the internet. Manually, I set the summer time schedule. I fell asleep somewhere between one and three. A couple of hours later the alarm started vibrating and singing. Catherine had asked me to call her whenever I woke up so she wouldn't stay asleep. A big six was in the dimmed screen of my phone. Was a text message enough? Must I actually call her? I did both. She was asleep, her phone marked 5 in the morning.

I went upstairs and grabbed a towel before entering the bathroom. Yesterday I discarded the idea of wearing a bra. I would sweat. It would look. Nobody would know me so I didn't really care about it. I still decided not to wear it. I shaved yesterday, too, so I wouldn't have to this morning. It was stupid to think of hiding my beard with make up. Why? I would run, I would sweat.

My phone did change its own time. It set ahead another hour. I slept an hour less than I should had. I woke Catherine an hour before we both should had risen.

I have been writing her in english for almost more than two hundred days. All of those days in english. I type a quarter of a thousand words daily in 20 minutes. And yet, I still feel judged. Catherine is nervous about speaking it. Her pronunciation bothers her. She feels that every mistake she might have will scream and point at her face. I know that feeling. The whole purpose of this exercise is to write, without censor nor editing. I should type my thoughts as they come. I should let everything slide, stop caring about syntax or orthography or grammar. And yet, here I am, writing a whole paragraph, again about her.

There is this little voice that speaks what I write. Every word sounds in my head as I see it being formed in my screen. The voice is not mine nor someone else's. It's not a personal voice. Sometimes it's male, others female. I don't really care. That voice is not the one that bothers me. It's that phantom ear in the back. That ear who listens and judges. The one ghost who is evaluating, looking for a mistake. No, it doesn't need to actually look. Mistakes are like little cockroaches moving when the lights turn to its sight. They escape and run and be as obvious as shooting stars in a dark night. And the ghosts notices, and marks them. The ghost speaks and judges. And then it stays, looking, hearing. Speechless, faceless.

"Who is the girl from the graduation that looks like Monica?" "The tall one".

We arrived first, before anyone. We were in the school, parked in the parking lot in front of the sports faculty one. We were early enough to actually receive t-shirts. There were only Large ones when it was our turn. Paola and I just received X-Large.

The race began. Catherine and I finished. Last.

Any other day I would had felt her. She would had been a burden. Maybe I would even hate her for bringing me with her. Making me be the last one. She wasn't forcing me, actually. Several times she offered, almost asked me to run. Run, go ahead. Any other day I wouldn't dare. I would had stayed and resented her still.

Today I stayed. But I didn't resent her, nor felt burdened. Today I wanted to hug her. I wanted to be by her side. What would be the point to go ahead, to meet Paolas or actually get to Chevo and Jessica's position. So what if I would end up being the first of the group to finish? I would win, maybe. But I'd be alone. Worse than that. I would had left her alone again

I didn't even think about that. In my head there was no option but walking besides her. I felt just as good finishing with her as I would had felt if I were the first one.

We ate with the rest of them. Paola didn't took the book with her. I might ask her about picking it up from her house. I need to return it before asking for the no-debt paper.

Why do I feel this, uh, pressure? Why is it hard for me to just send her a text message and ask her if I can pick it up?

Will I actually call tomorrow to set the appointment? Will I hesitate as I hesitated the day before my birthday? Will I ever tell my parents about any of those two appointments?

### 2016-03-14

I said I would wait and I did not. Just before starting typing I unplugged the headphones from the laptop and connected them to my phone. The little buzzes of the touches crawled like bugs from the cushions on my ears. There were three recordings in the screen. The top one was from this afternoon. I was narrating to myself, in some kind of journal entry way, how Anahi was talking to me about her crush asking her out.

For the first time I felt like somebody's best friend.

No, that's not fair. I've had best friends before. Is this what has happened with other things? Does every love feels like the first one? Does the current love seems like the best one? I was best friend of Catherine before we were a couple. I went with her to the motel as a best friend. I confided in her with a girl friend. I loved her as a friend. And before her there was Monica. We were not lovers or a couple until leaving high school. All the moments before then we were friends. She was the best one I had until then.

This time I felt required, solicited.

Today was just like yesterday. Again my phone skipped ahead an hour. The alarm broke the silent darkness of slumber an hour before it should. Catherine sent me a text saying her mother had left her near the border and she would wait just a little. There were no sounds in my home. Nobody had risen. What if they would not leave? I started being nervous, getting agitated with anxiety. Time seemed to pass so fast. I didn't notice the moment my father left with Miguel. Then, it was my mother's and Luis arguments as every other morning.

After they left, Catherine told me she would be leaving downtown. She'd text me when she were on the boulevard so I could meet her in the Burger King.

There was not as much traffic as I thought it would be. I texted her my location when I waited for the red light to turn green for the third time. From the gas station I estimated a time of arrival of 10 minutes. When I realized I had no data and decided to send it as a normal text message instead I realized it would not take me 10 minutes so I wrote 2 instead in the correction a minute later. Another minute later I was just outside the parking lot waiting for an altisa van to move.

I brought her home in my pijama. I was tired. Maybe I'm still am. As soon as we entered my room I got under my sheets. Paola had answered my message but Catherine continued the conversation in my place. She returned the book and sent Catherine a picture of the stamp.

After the university she had an appointment with the pediatrician. "For her or Diego?" I asked jokingly. She wrote it as "Sofi says".
"Then who is this?" And she explained it. I would read the conversation later when I drove Catherine home and read the first message of Anahi asking me if I were there. "How is it that whenever I need you you are not here?"

We hugged. I asked her if I could take my pants off. Why do I want to sleep in my underwear when I lie by her side? I love the sensation of my bare legs surrounding her. It was an innocent request. Yesterday she had asked me if she brought anything. No. I was not in the mood.

We did end up fucking. She touched me and I touched her. I made her finish after she did me. She put herself on top of me. After I put on the condom she slide me into herself and rode me. I came inside of her. This time the condom did not slip.

We fell asleep. I know I dreamed something but even just waking up I could not remember any of it. What could it had been about? I don't even remember the sensation it gave me.

After waking up we tried again. Now she slide her finger inside of me. Neither of us came this time. It was nice though.

Was it the first time or the second when the phone rang? Was it mine first or hers?

Hers she answered after several rings and checking that the number was known. "Good-bye" said a creepy woman's voice before hanging up.

Mine was an unknown number but not marked as Telcel. It, actually, was a man's name the one which appeared in the application that lets me block them. I answered and it was a lady. "Hello, with whom do you want to speak?" "Hi, miss, I'm from Telcel". I hung up.

She called me miss.

That was the reason I recorded myself again. This time I heard it with hearphones even though I wondered if I could wait. It was, weird. It doesn't sound feminine. It sounds a bit fake. I couldn't even hear it whole. I checked with the older one and the voice doesn't change much.

Would I call me miss if I heard that voice?

We got ready for school. I applied make up. Nobody called me any way. We paid the kardex. We made the appointment for the papers. It will be the 28th of this month. We met with Jhonny in the faculty and paid for my ticket for his show this Wednesday. Tomorrow I was supposed to pick the kardex but there will not be any labors. I can pick it up wednesday after therapy and before buying my pills.

I didn't make the appointment with the laser place. I didn't mention it to my parents either.

For being one who whines about waiting a lot, I really do not know what is it for that I make myself wait before telling my parents.

### 2016-03-15

There were a lot of messages when I grabbed my phone in the early morning. There had not passed more than half an hour since my mom and Luis left the house. Anahi, Catherine, and the conversation with the two of them. Anahi sent me several messages just to me. Her crush had asked her about a date. What could she do? What could she answer?

The whole morning I spent it in bed, under the sheets, trying to sleep and chatting with her. Catherine told us she was already in school. Later she was on her break. Anahi was asked where would she want to go. At what time. I helped her with her clothes and her hair. What shade could she use on her lips? Did her blouse look too transparent? Was it weird that he asked her to meet in Target?

After noon. No, it was 11 o'clock when I returned to bed. I was so tired and my eyes felt so heavy. I just put the alarm two hours later and shut my eyes. I turned off the alarm two times and got up at 3 in the afternoon. I ate saturday's breakfast in the morning and waited until 5pm to heat some chicken and potatoes. I was half through my plate when my mother called home. The phone was off. I ran upstairs and answered the one in my parents' room. I redialed her number. Luis answered.

"Miguel" he thought I was. I didn't fake the voice this time. I sound like him. Both my dad and my mom ask who is talking because they can't tell us apart. I hear him declare "I'm Miguel", several times too.

How did I talk yesterday when the Telcel lady heard me?

Minutes after they came with food from the Carl's jr, both my dad and Miguel entered the door. He has been going to the gym. Will he bulk up? Lean down? I can't remember the last time I saw him thin. He used to wear the same size I did. He was a Medium adult. He is now XLarge. I've stayed medium. I'm wearing now one of his shirts that he gave me. It still smells like Catherine. It's the one she wore when she slept in my bed.

Yesterday night I sent my resume to the job organization of the university. I see lots of reviews saying they got them a job. Maybe they will find something for me. Maybe they will ignore me, too...

As soon as my dad entered the house I told him they would show an animated film about food rated R. I showed him the video of my phone.

I don't see myself standing up to him and saying "I'm trans".

The first days I wondered about writing a letter. Two years ago I typed a long, repetitive e-mail that I would sent to the both of them. I deleted a couple days later. No. I discarded the idea but the document might still exist. I wouldn't use it anyway. It was maybe three or five pages long.

I could do it in a page. A lot has happened since then. I'm treated by my depression now. He knows that, but still I could use it as an anchor point.

He knows I take antidepressants.

He knows nothing else.

"I've been wanting to tell you something since a long time. I really don't know why it's so hard for me to open up with you.
It's been weeks since I've tried to muster up the courage to talk to you. But I can't find my voice, I can't find my words.
So I decided to write them. If I can't tell you, at least I'll show you.

It was hard for me to tell you I take antidepressants. I never told you the years before that I was depressed. I've never told you things.
I'm sorry. Even when I told you I was taking it, I couldn't describe the reason why.

I don't like my body. I don't like how I look. I don't like being a man. It feels wrong. It has felt wrong all my life.

I am not a man.

I am trans.

I am sure you know what that means..."

I can't. I thought I could, but no, I can't.

My mind goes blank. The words tangle up and explode and hide. The thoughts run loose and the emotions blow up like a grenade.

It's more hard than I thought it would be.

Even pretending, even rehearsing, I can't do it.

### 2016-03-16

I was supposed to wear something neutral today. I woke up and answered Catherine text messages. I had to turn off the alarms because I had no energy to wake up. I swallowed the two last pills in a dry gulp. I painted my face. I showered and shaved. I'm wearing black jeans and a red sweater. I walked the same path of every wednesday. I stopped in the Oxxo and bought a lemon beverage so I could break a 100 note. The cashier just looked at me and smiled politely. Nobody said anything. I looked at myself in the reflection of the building and it was nothing out of the ordinary.

I waited the fifteen minutes I was early sitting in the stairs of the last floor. I sent a snap to Chevo and paolas and Catherine and anahi. I wanted to see me. I finally played the doorbell and waited for Rene to come for me. He was alone.

The first part of the session I talked about how I can't dare to tell my parents. What is it that stop me from telling my dad. It's not his reaction, not that I don't know what to say. I'm scared of standing in front of him void of words. I'm afraid of the silent expectancy, of being naked and vulnerable in his eyes.

Then, he asked me since when everything started. I could tell his question was so he could gather the information he needs for the report. He hasn't started, or maybe he did. He confirmed the date of my appointment. "The seventh..." The other third quarters of the session I spent them talking, narrating the story and development of all this.

His question trying to discredit the differential diagnosis of a transvestite fetishism hurt me. I know it's not just sexual excitation. It's not a sexual desire. I have it more than clear.

I wear the clothes, I use that name. Even with the daily use of the antidepressants and the lower sexual desire. I have come from masturbating daily to doing it every other week, if even.

From his office I drove to the pharmacy near the university. I stopped in the parking lot and entered the building. I had the prescription and the wallet in my hand. I took off my sunglasses and held them in the other hand. I was almost blind when I gave the pharmacist my prescription.

Hello. Could you give me two bottles? Thank you.

She asked me if I had a card. I declined and then remember. "Oh, yeah, yes I do". The three of us smiled. Silly mistake.

"Could you attend the miss?" Said the one who had my prescription to the other one in the cashier.

I saved all the notes and the bottles and the prescription and my card. Everything set I drove towards the school. It was early still. The guard from the parking lot let me pass with just a wave of the hand. Does he know me? Does he recognize me?

The building of offices had all of its lights turned out. There were 5 minutes still to their return. I walked around the campus. I tried to get the wifi signal but it kept bouncing off my phone. I saw some familiar faces. Nobody who could recognize me. I walked around looking for a place to sit in a shadow. There was none.

I return to the offices and there was a line already. I stood in it, waiting. There was a little kid, maybe two or three years old. He had blue or green eyes and a soda bottle in his hands. His back was covered in a brown monkey backpack.

The three people in front of me were waiting for the other window. When I finally got to the clerk I asked him about my kardex. He asked for my name and started looking.

"My classmate couldn't come, can I take hers, too?" "If it's here, sure"

I said Catherine's lastname and he corrected me "First yours".

He was looking for Fernandez. He asked me if I was a graduate. He used the neutral, male form. Maybe it was my voice, maybe he saw through me.

He didn't find the kardex and asked my to write my name, program and number in a yellow post it. I wrote Catherine's too. Maybe he looked for a female name? I was waiting for that. "Ivan? Is this you?" "I thought you were a woman".

No.

The girl standing next to the door came with the papers. He signed them and gave them to me.

Luis and my mother arrived a couple of minutes ago. I was just painting my face again. They didn't notice. I let my eyes the same.

"You look pretty" Luis told me in a mocking way. "That's rude" my mother reprimanded him. He clarified he was talking about how a woman in my grad told me I looked pretty. "I'm just joking... or am I?"

I returned to my room and finished my eyes. Catherine sent me a text saying she was on her way.

We'll see jhonny's show.



### 2016-03-17

Anahi sent a post to the group of the seven team. The one where we are all signed up from years ago. We all were in the school. We all went to the congress. It was fourth semester. Before Anahi dropped out, before Paola got pregnant and dropped out, too, before Catherine and me went out of the country. It was before I broke up with Monica and before everything of mine came up.

Those were simpler times.

I think about fake times, like a fantasy bubble. A facade blinding us. Pretending we were living the time of our lives. No, I was pretending I was living.

My relationship was a mess and I refused to see it. My own persona was breaking. The repressed things were boiling inside and the shell was breaking. I was fake with "my friends". They knew nothing about me. They barely do now.

One by one were leaving. First it was Anahi. Paola was the one who saw through the lies. She left. Paola got isolated in a different group. Me and Catherine just left. I died in Spain and returned as a shadow. One by one we started realizing we were not this perfect group of loving friends. We paraded a lie. We celebrated a fake ribbon.

Anahi realized it when we didn't looked for her after her accident. I had my reasons stupid as they were. I don't know theirs. Catherine looked for her and was responded by apathy and indifference.

Then we started getting back together. First I looked for Catherine and she helped me get in peace with myself. From there, I opened up to Chevo and Jessica. Then it was Paola, and then the other.

By my own account I looked for Anahi, too. She's been talking with me about her crush. I felt as her real best friend. It was nice.
Meeting with Paola, the last one which I told, she kept repeating about this team, this group of friends. I was surprised by the way Anahi opened up to her and met her and talked as if years hadn't passed by.

On our own way, she confessed us how she wanted to correct her, eliminate this idea of hers that we're all still friends, this fantastical team.

And now here was her post. No... even before that. There were comments on memories. The first time we all went out. Maybe it were the pictures of the color run. Maybe she saw them, all of us posting them and celebrating. After that day, she came with the comments. Then told us about how she answered back to a snap of Eusebio. And today finally was her post.

All this talk about closure she asked for a meeting, seeing us all together. Maybe that first coffee to which we went the first time. Argana. She was answered by emotion and excitement. I was filled with doubt. Everyone kept asking about a time or place, getting organized. All but Catherine and me posted.

Catherine was going to meet Miguel that day. She's not excited to meeting them.

Before that Anahi asked us to see the batman and superman movie. We could wear superman and batman t-shirts. Catherine could wear one of wonder woman. Wonder woman, like the character which my mother's cousin liked to play as. Anahi would be team batman so I would wear a superman one. I know Miguel had one. I remember seeing him with it. Was it a long time ago? Did he give it to me? I don't have it. Maybe it was in his closet. I went to see.

I saw his open drawer and remember that time that I found a pair of panties reeking of semen. They were hidden in a camera pouch that was actually mine. Was the underwear my mothers? Did he do the same thing I did? Was he like me? I panicked and left it there.
So this time I opened them looking for something, expecting what I would find. When I saw the pillowcase at the back I didn't have to open it to know what it hid. Instead of one pair there were like five. I didn't smell anything.

Does he masturbate with them? I know he locks the door. Does he wear them? Does he just touches himself with them?

I know it's a common fetish. I want it to be a fetish. I wouldn't know how to take it otherwise.

I'm scared of telling my parents. Was Catherine right when she asked if it scared me of other one saying it first?

No. I'm scared of not being the only one. Of being blamed.

### 2016-03-18

In a couple of hours Catherine will arrive for me. We will eat and then watch a Tango concert in the CECUT. We bought the tickets the day before yesterday before Miguel arrived to watch Jhonny's show. Yesterday I couldn't decide what to wear today. I thought about the leggings and a blouse. Catherine proposed me to wear the blue one I wore in the pride. Two days ago I asked her if I could wear a dress. Why did I want to wear one? I haven't worn the gray one I bought since we went to the beach months ago. Was it last year?

The other one, the first one she gave me I haven't worn it since one of the times in the motel, more than a year ago.

So I had several options. It was all about trying em today in the morning. And so I did.

I woke up with the usual sounds in the morning. I had different dreams. In one I remember looking at my hand, the lines that are drawn by its age and reading Monica's name. It was like a Facebook status. I was surprised by it, it had a text. The next time that I looked at my hand it was gone. I tried to read from it but it had lost all meaning.

The next dream, that is fading right now as I try to recall it, it was about a game? No. I was in Mexicali. Something like that. I remember a house from there. Sleeping, beds. Something about my grandmother?

I was in my house. We were playing a game like Monopoly. My father and I. Were somebody else playing, too? I had rolled the dice and it was one. When I tried to move my piece it was gone? Where was I set? How could I move? Somebody had misplaced it. My father was winning. I had no properties. No, I did, one, maybe two... He had like three monopolies. I was sad, upset. I told him I didn't want to play anymore. There was no point, I didn't know where I was. He was a little upset. My uncle was there with him. Everyone talked about me. A sore loser, a brat. They judged me. I decided to put the game away. The board was big and heavy, like a mat or a rug. I wanted to folded but, no matter how I tried, I didn't get it right. Defeated, I went to lie down on the couch. I used it as a cover and put it over me. It was so heavy I could not move. It pushed me down against the couch. Every intent of moving was harder than the last.

And I woke up. It was an hour before noon and yet I was restless. I put an alarm half an hour later but ended up turning it off..

I ate breakfast and watched some tv. I tried one the blue blouse but it's wrinkles annoyed me. I saw my arms huge. I saw the dress in my closet and decided to try it on. I put it and then this black cardigan over it. I looked at my reflection and liked it. Even the black betraying spots on my face didn't bother me much. I took a picture and sent it to Catherine. Just now she saw it. She took a screenshot. I took another one and sent it to her. To Anahi and Paolas and even Chevo, too.

Is it possible that those kind of pictures make them uncomfortable?

Catherine, in the morning, told me how she would not go to the day at the beach that Anahi was planning with them. She sent the conversation to Miguel but he didn't answer. I can understand that. It seems unfair, I know.

She actually asked them, it was ok to take a male guest.

"Yeah, you can bring Ivan" Answered back Jessica. "A MALE guest, Miguel... Sofia is part of the package" Jessica knew. It was a joke. She told her to ask Anahi, but for everyone else it was cool.

She used that name, she defended me. Jessica is the only one who hadn't heard it before. Chevo, maybe, although he has me on Twitter. Both Anahi and Paola recognized me from the picture and name. It's foolish to think Chevo didn't too.

"I added you, already" He said, and yet he had not. He followed me until after I did.

In 40 minutes Catherine will leave her house and come for me.

Ever since the shower I've felt my heart rush. Is it the medication, maybe? I've been thinking about going to my dad. I decided to apply make up even though I asked Catherine for her lipstick. Do I want to be found? Do I want to be cornered and forced to say out loud?

If I don't say it, soon, I fear I'll be betrayed by my own unconscious self.

### 2016-03-19

There were dreams today but I've already forgotten.

Luis woke me up with his breakfast sounds. It was early, like 8 o clock and my door was open. Yesterday before falling asleep... no, it was before that...

I wrote yesterday's words before Catherine picked me up. We ate in the pomodoro restaurant. From there, we parked in the River Plaza. She bought an oreo milk popsicle and I, a glass of sangria. We waited and took pictures and talked. The car was parked near the food garden. In there we chatted about the thought of having kids. I remember her doubts and insecurities about her wants. After last trip to the motel and the slipped condom and the day after pill, we both gave the idea a recap. She do wants them. Because of her, her own motivation and needs, not her parents.

I want them, too. I like the idea of a little child. I am scared. I am scared of that little person growing and resenting me. I am afraid of the people's sights and judgements. In the morning Jessica had made that joke about me being Catherine's guest. She corrected her. We mentioned that, too.

"I didn't tell you, did I?... I was talking with Chevo, when he sent us the picture of his conversation with the empty group. He told me something, I can't remember what we were talking about, but he said 'like the colored people, as Sofia would say' ".

He used the name. I had just told her how I didn't identify what Jessica's exchange made me feel. She said how she was a little upset, but Jessica didn't know the name. She wrote, no she thought of telling her "I've told you, she is not a man to me. She is a woman." and yet again, how could she write I am part of the package? "Don't call her Ivan. Ivan's always included".

And so, she wrote Sofi, as if she had known.

After the anecdote about Chevo and realizing that. Late at night I wrote them. I told them about the name. I wrote a little letter in a new conversation in whatsapp. The didn't see it until today's morning. And that was the first thing I saw when I opened my eyes and reached the phone.

Their answers. They had heard it but didn't want to ask. They were waiting for me to tell them. Something was left vague, though, did I want for them to use the name or not?

I covered myself in the sheets and muted a scream with the pillow. I was anguished. What had I done? Why? How could I ever tell my dad if even with them that they know it's a disaster?

After a couple of breaths I answered with the same nonchalantic manner. Yes, fuck it. Use it. It would mean a lot to me. I repeated them the offer of asking whatever they want. I gave them some ideas.

After the shower we drove to the united states. I offered the idea of eating in the In N out. We all ate outside in the table I could save.

All day I had the words stuck in my chest. I could feel them moving with every breath. They were burning me. Nothing stopped me from saying it. In the freeway on our way home I even mouthed them silently with my lips as if I were rehearsing the movements needed.

"I want to go and ask how much they would charge me for getting rid of my facial hair".

Of what was I afraid? Of course I know. Because it means of saying the rest, too. Even Rene told me. "They will ask you why".

Yeah, it's right. And I know, with that little push I'll let everything out.

Even Luis asked me if I were going to look for clothes. "No, I don't like men's clothes". We looked for the t-shirts. I found one of Superman and a large one of Batman. I asked Anahi if she had bought them. She told me no. I could buy hers and let her pay me later.

We found a couple of sweatshirts. They were short-sleeved and a little shorter on the front than on the back. They were longish and yet slim. I liked them. There were some red ones. Luis liked them, too. After looking a little I found some gray ones, too. On the other end there was a blue thin one. It was Large so I suspected it was women's. I grabbed it, still. I liked it.

After a while I noticed it was too feminine so I left it.

I almost run out of soap so I need to buy some from Amazon. I saw some bags that I liked and a little leather wallet, the most expensive item that I absolutely loved.

Anahi told me a story about her. Some pictures she saved and kept. She wanted to give me and Catherine an album of us. It would had been amazing. But we grew apart. She thought about ripping them apart.

I felt sad and wanted to hug her and apologize.

We will print a picture of ours to Catherine.

### 2016-03-20

It's just barely past midnight and yet I got this urge to write. Why? It's the earliest I've written yet.

I had this sudden low.

I was organizing the pictures. Since the graduation I hadn't moved them. They were a mess. The dates, the times, they were all misplaced. And I looked through them. One by one, searched its place according to the rest, measuring the time when it should had taken place.

Since the graduation, firsts of march, to yesterday. I've put all of them on their place now. They are all set. I went back to see if I deleted all of the excessive ones. I can't tell.

The software kept crashing over and over. It always reopened on the same picture of me with red lips smiling to the camera in the food garden. I just had told Catherine how I liked the way I looked. Did it change? Did I change?

"Did the picture change or did my eyes?" Said the last twit I posted on Sofia's account. I had just changed the display picture...

Yolanda kept telling Catherine how she was narrating what happened and yet spoke about nothing at all. I feel, or realize just now how I am actually doing that just now. I opened this window to type how I feel. I could have told the moment that I noticed Yolanda's position. She's looking for someone to be her secretary. A student, she can liberate professional practice or social service. I could call her and ask her. The time is ok. 4 hours sitting on her office taking calls and doing her scheduling.

Catherine told me to call and ask. I couldn't. I was paralized.

"What is Catherine studying? ... Her mother told us, how she wasn't losing her year. She actually made me think how we let you do nothing".

My father asked me if I kept contacting or received notice of the school. I should call and ask.

I had told Catherine how I didn't feel their pressure. And today it was apparent. Why didn't I write about that? Didn't I remember?
Just now I feel like crying.

All day I had been with an euthymic mood. Joking, talking... What happened this moments?

I looked the pictures of a year ago. I have changed. I don't look the same. In some I look more feminine. Yet, it's not enough. And then I think of Chevo and Jessica. I asked them. It may be hard but nothing that they can't get accustomed to.

In three weeks I'll have an appointment with the endocrinologist. He will ask me questions and prescribe me some tests.

My father is just leaving to pick Miguel up. I should tell them. Mention the laser, do something. I want to scream it.

I feel so pathetic. I wanted to change before I telling them. I wanted to see me and just go like "oh, yeah you already look like a woman, I guess it's natural". It hurts me, saying it, how I feel like something and yet look entirely different.

Am I scared? Am I angry? Am I alive?

Am I anything?

What am I? Who am I?

I'm tired. I want to lie down and cry a little. I look at the pictures. I look attractive. I sent one to my aunt. A picture of me and Luis. "Handsome boys". I looked better than him. He looks handsome, thin and tall, with an athletic fit. His face is the one of a pubescent boy. My body is fuller and less formed and yet my face is softer, more defined. I looked like a handsome man.

I am not one. I don't want to be.

The picture I put in Twitter I looked feminine. The clothes don't look out of the ordinary. My face is softened by the make up and my eyes defined by the blackness of its surroundings. My face is contoured by my dark falling locks. There is an almost imperceptible trace of shadow around my lips and yet it's almost invisible. My factions doesn't scream male. But Catherine is right. There is something there, something that makes you doubt. Like an essence. Or a stink.

Luis said again "woman". "Pretty".

I made some comments about body hair, like forcing me to blurt out the laser appointment. Chest haired man. "I am not one", it's true, I don't have chest hair. He corrected himself: Chest haired woman".

He's wrong. I know it and feel it.

But where? I don't have chest hair, except I do.

I am not a woman, except I am.

### 2016-03-21

I don't know what I have done wrong.

I feel this immense guilt as if I had done something terrible. Yesterday, the day before, I stayed up and did the words of the next day. Yesterday? Yesterday we went to Mexicali. The day before we had gone to the United States. I was fine, I was playful and cheerful. I could see in me the initiative to actually say it, to tell my dad. Something late at night made me feel different.

I went to bed and dreamed. Dreamed about driving at night in the college. Then it was a party in my own home. Before that I walked to the picture with a cane and I hid it behind my back as I smiled. In the party my mother asked me about jobs. Mariana from the hospital was there. I screamed at my mother. She wasn't understanding me. There was this pressure. "You told me, promised me that the place where I'd do my internship would ask me to stay. They did not."

I waited outside. My father was just arriving home. And I did not say anything. I wanted to meet him and tell him. He went straight to the door. Mariana and her boyfriend said their good-byes.

Yesterday I know I dreamed something but I can't remember it. There was a dream in the conversation with Catherine but that I can't recall either. Something about my mother and grandma? Yeah. I was sick and lying in bed.

I feel like I wrote it before.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. He asked me to change our appointment. I was at the beach with them, no, at the Oxxo, when I read his message. 'Sofia' he wrote to me as usual. It felt as jab, a stab in the abdomen. It was fake. No, I was.

Maybe wednesday we'll go to the universal studios. No, we'll cross but wait there for the next day. Thursday is the day of Catherine's surgery.

I asked her if she wanted me to stay. She didn't answer. Anahi had offered her help moving her furniture. She denied it because her mother would help her. She was considering mine.

I was trapped. If I went, I'd be leaving her alone and wouldn't be able to enjoy the trip with my family. If I stayed, she wouldn't even note my presence and I would leave my family without me again. I wanted to split into two so I could be with both of them. And again I felt this rage inside of me. I have all the time of the world. I do absolutely nothing. My days are as empty as space and yet everything has to collapse.

I look into the mirror and see a chimera again. A mixture of ideas and wasted dreams and potential failures and what I'm not and what I could had been. It hurts me as it never hurt me before. I am a little more than two weeks to meeting the specialist and yet I feel it so distant and far away. I feel like I will never be able to escape this body. As if I will never actually meet freedom.

I talked to Anahi. Maybe too much. She attacked Catherine with questions. Why do we do intercourse if I don't like it? Does she ask me to do it?

I just told her what I was thinking and feeling. I just opened up with somebody. Why do I keep doing the wrong thing?

"Can I ask you a favor? In a month that I propose to go out all of us again, please tell me not to"

I told my mother to not go today because of this meeting. I caused the surgery dilemma so I could see them in the beach in the cold feeling like a pathetic freak wearing a blouse. Everybody knew. All of them know. It's the same. Nothing has changed. They use the name but is just that, a fucking name. It has no meaning.

"Being antisocial together [male neutral]" tagged me Anahi in a twit when I was talking to her in the teriyaki place. Even she that would later "defend" me with Catherine slips it up. She always slips in the plural.

Why do I feel like crying?

Tomorrow I won't have make up on my eyes. I can cry tomorrow. Tell everything to Rene. But what will I say?

Catherine's period came today. I was supposed to be relieved. I feel all but tranquility.

### 2016-03-22

It's really weird to type with my ears uncovered. I actually miss the pressure of the headphones on my temples.

Did we have our first fight? Was this our first? How can this be the only time it's happened when we actually stopped talking for months?

I opened up with Anahi. "How are you?" she asked like half the world does. This time I was honest and I wrote what I felt. How I actually was. She envies my family. She actually does. She has a brother and a mother and a father which she doesn't care about and a tragic memory that still haunts her.

It's the little moments and not the trips or the parties that make my family valuable. "You don't know, they could be the most inclusive people ever". And yes, they could be. Right now that I went upstairs to the bathroom I actually looked into my parents' bedroom. I listened to the idea of telling them. Telling him.

"You remember what Luis said yesterday in the crossing border? How it might be cool being a girl? I feel something like that, kind off. It's not that I want to be a girl, it's that being a boy literally hurts me. That's what depresses me, that's why I keep going to therapy and I take antidepressants. I'm not a boy. I am trans."

I feel those words in my throat as I felt the laser ones. I don't think about his reaction or even his feeling. I don't care about what would happen after, I just want that sweet relief of not hiding it anymore. I could do anything, by anyone.

I'll do it sooner rather than later.

"You can't ask me to tell my family while you haven't told yours. It's my family and I will tell them, like you, on my own time."

Was that a challenge? Of course not. Why did I take it as one?

Why am I angry? Is this anger or guilt? Do I feel guilty or sad?

Is this the depression or just failure?

Tomorrow we will leave after my mother's appointment. We will cross the border and stay in a motel. Friday Anahi and me would go visit her. I feel weird now the idea of going, seeing her. I remember the feeling of her fingers around mine, the shared warmth of her hand inside my pocket. It was undeserved. It was wrong.

How can I love her when I am wrong?

Catherine, Monica, Anahi, Carlos, Miguel, Eusebio, Jessica, Yolanda, Rene, Liliana, Paola, the other Paola. All of them know about me, about my name. My mother and hers. They know, too. They have not seen me, they might not even comprehend.

According to today's session that might be the meaning of my dream. I, lying in bed, burdened by a heavy illness. My mother escapes from the house, leaves. I screamed at her what I don't dare to mention. I wish I could leave, too. I wish I could abandon all of this, but I can't. I am the one bedridden. I have grown accustomed to talk all by myself."

She knows like me but she acts as if nothing had happened.

"I am not Ivan". I have told countless times to Luis. Why don't I dare to tell my mother I am not her son?

Because I still am.

I told Catherine I feared she would leave me if I didn't penetrate. I think we don't fool anybody when we act as if I were her girlfriend. I don't look like a woman, I don't feel like one nor sound like one. I look like a man and sound like a man and smell like a man. I touch her like a man and kiss her like a man. I don't have the body. I have this one. I can't deny her what I have to the promise of giving what I never will.

I can;t be her daughter, I can't tell Luis I am not his brother. Because I look and sound like this. I haven't change. And again I fall into this unreachable request. To change my outside I have to accept what I feel inside. But I will never accept how I feel until I change the way I look.

I don't know what will happen with Catherine. I don't know how can I save this.

I will tell my father, and then so what? And then wait to the endo? And then, what's the point of finally looking as I should if there will be nobody who really sees me?

Who cares if I finally look like one and the whole world sees me as one if the only person who could see the real me before is not here anymore?

### 2016-03-23

My mother and father just arrived from their meeting in the hospital. I think I should had cheated today again. Maybe I should had just let the days pass and the streak to break. I can start again when I take the pills.

Yesterday I wanted to tell my dad. I could actually see it. I felt the words in my throat. I could spell them inside of my mouth. It wasn't a matter of if or not. It was a when. I could tell them before getting to the park. I could tell them after on our way home. I wanted to say it. I didn't even matter than Luis and Miguel were with me. I want to tell them all at the same time.

"I want to tell you something..."

I was lying in bed and closed my eyes and I could see me. I was taking my little notebook from my notebook and the pencil and just started writing in it. The page was so small that only the words needed would fit. "I don't know how to say it: I'm trans".

That's all I need to say. That's all that I want. I could say the rest, that's the thing I have to take out what I'm scared won't come, what might get stuck and asphyxiate me. After it gets out, everything else will float.

"I'm trans"

"Remember how Luis told us he might like being a woman? I feel something like that. I just hate being a man. It literally hurts me. That's why I keep going to therapy even though I graduated. That's why I take antidepressants, that's why I've been depressed most of my life. Because this body doesn't fit, it's wrong. It doesn't matter how much weight I gain or loss or how long my hair gets. It's being a man what makes me sick. I will change it. And I need you to know...

I can't keep going.

Catherine and I are not ok.

She asked me to visit her Friday, just me. I have to cancel with Anahi. I feel nervous. I'm not really sure I want to visit her. I feel she's not Catherine anymore. I feel like she were possessed. I thought it would leave me alone.

I'm scared of seeing it in her eyes. I already hear it in her words and it hurts.

Jessica asked about me. "She told me she exchanged more words with Miguel than you"

"When she told you that, did she call me Ivan?"

"Yes".

Of course. It would be hard. She would try. It's fake.

"Is everything all right?"

I nodded. Why do I keep lying?

I can't tell him like this, now. We'll leave in a moment.

I cant' keep going. I can't...

I can't... I can't...

Dad, can I talk with you? I've been meaning to tell you something since a long time ago. It's really hard. It's about my therapy. You know I'm taking antidepressants. It was hard to tell you even that. I didn't tell you why, though. I don't like my body. I've been depressed since I was little. It's been getting worse by time. I don't like how I look. I don't like being a man. I don't like looking and sounding like one. It literally hurts me. That's why I keep going to therapy even though I graduated. That's why I'm depressed and I've been taking antidepressants for almost a year. They help, but not completely. You see, I am trans. I am a woman, something like that.

I want, I need to change my body. I will transition. And I know everything will be harder. When I realized what was happening with me I was a complete mess. I was suicidal, I couldn't see a future of me. My whole life plan was ruined. I thought my future was gone.

Now, I'm not so pessimistic. I will look for a specialist, I'll change. In the capital I can do the process to change my name and birth certificate. I won't be alone. Catherine knows and loves me like this. Some of my closest friends know, too. I know people will hate me, and almost anyone won't understand me, maybe won't even try. I don't mind if it's something hard for you to take down. I don't expect to just accept it. I just want to know you'll keep loving me, even though I wasn't and never will be the son you thought you had.


I actually thought I would be able to tell him today. I knew I wouldn't be able to the moment I told Catherine I was thinking of it.

Yesterday's was Catherine surgery while I was in Hollywood. I just sent her a picture of this text. She answered back saying how it hurt her. She feels guilty about how I asked her to tell her parents. Today she waited for me in her house. I visited her. Her mother opened the door for me and ask me to move my car a little back just like she does.

I read the text again after looking at her answer. Her emotions were behind my eyes in this second reading. They overflowed me, they rolled down by my cheeks.

Yesterday I was in the park. I woke up in the early morning by Luis side. We shared a bed. Miguel was sleeping in the other one. I was awake before his alarm started. I turned the first and second one off. He did wake up to shut the third one down. Was I going to dare wearing the jeggings? I had forgotten the black lycra shorts I wear under them. I forgot my long black cardigan, too.

The bathroom was empty and dark. The sink was outside the door, exposed. I decided to shower first. Miguel was still asleep, maybe, but Luis was already awake. I took my clothes and brought them with me to the bathroom. I put the gray panties first and the gray bra. Was I wearing a tank top underneath? Yeah, it was a red one. The jeggings fit fine. There was no obvious bulge. I was anxious, though, I did hesitate and fought with my genitals, trying to hide them, to get rid of them, even for a day.

Just like that I wanted to hide my beard. How could I shave? The sink was outside. I forgot the shaving gel, too.

My dad just came down the stairs, like my dream, he walked away instead of close. Do I want him to come?

Before leaving the day before I was typing this words. I had to cheat but I did half of them. He came and saw me. "Are you alright?" I nod my head and started cheating. We were getting off. Luis told him what I was doing. He asked him instead of me. Words for what? What are they about? How do you know they are 750 and not 749 or less?

He tries to get close, to know me. He asked me about Caherine. Maybe he finds it just as hard as me.

I wore the gray sweatshirt in the bathroom and shaved with the cheap razor and the rest of the little shampoo from the hotel.

I was with Catherine when my mother started uploading the pictures.

"I hadn't seen them, what are they, tights?" she noticed. Would anyone else notice, too? Thousands of people cross sights with me that day. What do they saw? I ask the question as if there could be a possibility of doubt.

She told me today she loved me.

She loves me.

She told me but I can't to my dad.

### 2016-03-26

The washing machine is now functional. We are not in Mexicali. The technician finished in the afternoon so we decided to stay.

It's fine, I guess. I woke up in the early morning by the light that came from the window in the other room. I dreamed something, I guess. I remember a dinner or something like that. Catherine was with me and there was another girl, too. Ana Karen? The young woman who exit her session with Liliana just before we waited for our patient.

I fell asleep again after eating my breakfast. My father spent most of the day alone in the living room. The Godfather was recorded in our DVR. He saw parts of them. My mother stayed in bed until after the washing machine was fixed. Miguel did so, too.

I should shower, there is a faint smell that annoys me. I feel dirty, like if a stench surrounds me. Maybe I can clean it away with water. Does it have to do with this feeling of disgust?

Did I forget to take my pills or did I took the double of my dosage?

Yesterday I went to Catherine's house. I wore a bra underneath my t-shirt. We lied in her bed. Her mother looked at us, found us in Catherine's room. She asked her if I was asleep. I was sad. I felt vulnerable and exhibited. "Her boyfriend, Ivan".

"I'm not your boyfriend" I told her hurt.

She told me she liked me and it hurt me also. How could she like me?

No, I can't do this. There is this smell that distracts me. I'm dirty. I have to clean myself.


I returned. I am tired. "How are you?" Catherine asked me moments after I left. I changed my pijama. I am wearing the same pants I bought when I was in jr high, four years of college, three of high school, more than 8 years ago. My father is watching tv in his room. My mother is watching some show or movie on her ipad besides him.

I walked into their room to grab a towel. I showered and wondered. Will Rene be disappointed with me not talking to him still? He knows it's hard for me. He must know. But yet again, maybe it's something that I ought to do before he can give me his letter, his report.

I read about those people on the internet. Some are filled of doubts, others with pain and desperation. Some have told to their parents and met nonsupport. I am thirsty. My throat is dry. Maybe it's all those words stuck in there.

I could well go to their room and kneel down on their bed. My mother already knows but my father doesn't have to know that. Maybe he knows, as well.

I can look at them and wait for their "what happened?".

"Nothing... it's just about my therapy. I asked Rene for a report, I will show it to you if you want, but I could tell you right now, anyway. You already know I take antidepressants and that I've been depressed. You don't know why. I talked a little with my mother but that was it. I don't like my body nor how I look. I don't like being a man. I don't like having my hair short or hearing people telling me 'I'm really handsome'. It hurts me, it hurts me looking at myself in the mirror or in pictures. It hurts me wearing a suit, recently it even hurts me hearing my own name.

I'm transgender. I'm trans. I'm part of that group of people that has been appearing on the news. The ones who go through this treatment to change their appearance and sometimes even get surgeries and go through this long and tedious procedure to change their names and papers. I'm those kind of people whom this new laws that prohibit them to enter to certain bathrooms affects them.

I've been talking about it, working with it with my therapist. That's why I've kept going to therapy even though I graduated. The medication helps a little but it's not enough.

That's why I want to make an appointment to get rid of my facial hair and I've already set an appointment with a specialist, an endocrinologist to start some treatment.

I know this might seem rush and I'm really sorry about that, but it's not to me. I've been dealing with this for years, all by myself. And I've been meaning to tell you, but I was so ashamed and scared that it took me just now to get the courage.

...And even yet, you won't read this. As you haven't read any of the other rehearsals I've written for myself."



### 2016-03-27

My parents and Miguel went to the movies. Luis is here, home, with me. Right now he's playing with the Xbox. He made himself some chicken and a pot of soup. We shared the soup. The ice cream that my father bought in the weekend is mostly cream. I served myself a cup and he filled a glass for himself.

I, doesn't matter how much I try to shift my point of view to the present, keep going to the past. What is it in me that fixates on the past?

I'm scared of thinking about the future. Paola sent us a message telling us there wouldn't be a party for her graduation but a trip to Las Vegas. It would be two years from now. Catherine was right, we don't even know where we would be by then. I can't see myself holding a job, having a way to prove financial independence. Two years from now I plan on already having changed my own name. Looking completely different as how I look today. What will I do when I plan to renovate my visa? Will they let me? Will I be able to?

It's just a trip, not even that. It's nothing more than a plan and it brought me fear and anxiety. Next year I want to be in the process of getting into the master. I want to be on hormones. In less than two weeks I'll see the endocrinologist. My father doesn't know about me. My mother doesn't know about the appointment. They might get upset that I didn't consult them.

So, there is a reason why avoid talking about the future. What's my excuse for ignoring the present, too?

Even writing daily, I focus on what I did, not what I am doing, thinking nor feeling.

What is it that I am thinking just now? I am waiting for my parents. I'm hearing Hurt of Johnny Cash. I'm listening to Luis playing in the living room. Could I tell Luis? We are alone in the house. He is confiding more and more on me. He talks about his friends, he makes jokes. He asks me serious questions. He might understand me.

I should tell my dad. I should update my mom about what I am doing. They already know about the laser. I told them, I got their approval. My mother even encouraged me to do it, to endure the pain.

What is it that keeps me from calling and making the appointment? I will just call and say I'm interested, ask for prices or a date to do a consultation. Then just wait for the day or time to go there. Whenever I go, they will just look at me, see me, evaluate my face, how many facial hair I have, they might tell me the number of sessions, the prices and the basic care before and after.

I see the pictures and my facial hair is the most obvious sign of my past. A couple of sessions, not more than a year and it will be gone. I want it. I am sure I don't want a beard. I am completely sure that I want it gone. Even more than the hormones. So why am I delaying it? What is it that scares me?

I keep looking to the message that I wrote to Chevo and Jessica. I offered them to ask me any questions and didn't answer my own examples. The last time they saw me, in the beach, nobody called me by any name. Jessica asked Catherine about me, about us. She used Ivan. She has every right, I wasn't even present. I would never read nor hear it. Why did it hurt? I asked them, I told them. It hurt. Now they were asked, so not doing wasn't an accident.

No, they did tell me. If it slips out is not personal. Why did that hurt, too? It's normal. It's years knowing me by a certain way. I can't just expect them to change the way they know me overnight.

I considered answering the questions. Opening up. Reminding them about my offer to chat. A cup of coffee, a cup of tea, anything. I could pay, it's not a problem. I just want to talk, nothing in particular, doesn't even have to be about me. Just want to see some familiar faces, hear some voices, remind myself that I'm not alone.

Why don't I just send it?

Why don't I just go to him?

"I want to talk with you about something".

### 2016-03-28

"It makes me nervous you telling your dad ... It makes me nervous thinking about telling my parents"

Today I could not wake up in the morning. Yesterday I stayed almost the whole day in bed. I woke up and ate breakfast. Returned to bed and slept. It was a cycle of getting up and coming back to bed. Past midnight I longed for that need of sleeping. I'll keep getting bigger and bigger if I don't stop sleeping.

So, this morning I kept postponing the alarms. Catherine went and returned from the doctor and I was still in bed. Did I dream something? Does it matter?

I thought, again, about telling my dad. Today he would return to work. He would not be at home the whole day. His vacations are over. There are just two sessions left with Rene until my appointment in the hospital.

I made myself breakfast with the leftover taco from yesterday. My parents went to the movies with Miguel. They saw Batman v Superman. Luis stayed home with me. My father told my mother how Luis stayed because we was waiting to go see it with me. How he was waiting to the day I would leave him alone. Does he really thinks I would be capable of doing something like that? Is that how he sees me?

He is still upstairs.

No, I just heard his voice in the living room. I won't tell him tonight. Probably I won't tell him tomorrow either. I don't know if I will tell him this week.

There is this thought that keeps coming back and back again. Rene will give me the report. He might give it to me the day after tomorrow. Will I show it to my dad? There is something a lot of people do when they come out to their families. They either send an email. or leave a written note. I, two years ago, when I was in Europe, wrote and e-mail to send home. Why have I discarded that idea since then?

Because it's just waiting. It's giving him the letter and waiting for it to be seen. After that it's waiting for him to say something, made a comment of it. Ask a question. What if he stays silent? What if nothing comes out of it?

What if I stand up in front of him and hand him the letter face to face. A little piece of paper that just says "I want to tell you something." In the backside it can say "I'm transgender". No, I keep thinking of this gimmicky stupid ideas of delaying my own words.

I will go to him whenever we can be alone. I'll tell him I want to talk with him about something so I can't back out. Then I'll just say it. There are few point that I have to touch. I don't have to give him all my story or share all the details.

I know this. I will start with what he already knows.

I'm still going to therapy. I take antidepressants. I am depressed.

From there, I can, slowly,say what he might know or suspect.

I don't like my body. That's why I am depressed. I haven't liked it since I started puberty. I've been living in this kind of fogged state, numb.

No... I start rambling again. Keep it short.

Known facts: I keep going to therapy. I take antidepressants. I am depressed.

The surface: I don't like my body. I don't like how I look. I don't like being a man.

Connect it to the known: That's the reason I keep going and I'm taking medication.

A little deeper: The treatment helps but it's not enough. I feel better but it's still not right. There is something wrong with me. I don't like being seen as a man. I want, no, need to change my body.

The punchline: I am transgender.

 From there the rest is just explaining. I realized before going to spain. I've been scared about them, about my own future. It's been two years since I realized it and started coming up to terms with it. I've talked with my closed friends. I've been talking about it with my therapist. I know what I will do. I will go to an endocrinologist and ask for treatment. I will go to a laser place and get rid of my facial hair. I will travel to the capital and apply to a master. There I can do all the legal paperwork so I can live my own life. Not anyone's else. Live as who I really am.

I'm not ready. I'm not ready to tell him, to defend myself.

I can't stand more time living like this but I'm not strong enough to fight for what I want.

### 2016-03-29

5o again.

Tomorrow I will might get my report.

150 days with today's streak and I haven't told my father. I've written it here several times. I've rehearsed it in my bed, in the shower, in my sleep. Today when I arrived from Catherine's house he came down to my room to ask me to move the car. Since then he has spent the whole night in his room. My mother was here in the living room but then went to give him company. It should not change a thing.I could tell them both. It would be easier. Both of them in bed and I kneeling at the bottom.

"Can I talk with you about something? It's about my therapy. You already know I've been taking antidepressants. It's been, well, more than 150 days, actually. Almost half a year. I have been depressed. I don't know how much have you noticed but you know that already. That's why I keep going to therapy even though I graduated. I talked a little with my mom about it before. I don't like my body, I hate it. I don't like how I look, how people see me. I don't like being a man. I'm not one.

I hate saying those words, explaining it. It's hard. I am transgender. You have seen the news about people like this. They change their bodies, their names. People don't want them using certain bathrooms. It's a mess, but I am like this.

I like when I go out with Catherine and they "get mistaken". They welcome us as two women. The waitress asks me for my order as a "lady". Months ago sometimes someone would come to me and call me by a female noun. Then they would see my face closely and apologize profusely. But they were wrong. I liked their mistake. I liked how they see me the first time. It was their apology that hurt.

So, yes. I don't like being treated as a man, I don't like when people expect things from me because of my genitals.

No. I just don't like my body. I don't like my big hands or my broad shoulders. I hate these tiny damn hairs that grow on my face. I want to shave daily but my skin gets irritated. I wish I could just take them away. I've always hated cutting my hair.

It doesn't matter. I don't have to explain it. It's not something new. This is what I've been talking about in my sessions. This is what depresses me. Half a year ago I needed help and I was prescribed with antidepressants, but they're not enough. Sure they've help but they don't fix the problem.

I want to change what I don't like. I want to stop being who I am not, who people expect me to be. I want to be myself. I want to be me. And I have to change my body to do that. I will. I will change my sex."

No.

No, no, no. I can just say that. That is not right. How can I stand in front of them and open up? How can I explain it?

What if they don't understand me? What if he doesn't agree or approve?

What if he hits me?

Yesterday before falling asleep I imagined asking him to fix the glove box and using that time alone to start talking. I imagined his reaction. It was not what I would actually expect. He reacted violently. He was enraged, he raised his hand and hit me. He ran towards me. He would keep hitting me.

That is not my dad. That would never happen. Why did I think it?

Today I went to Catherine's house. Tomorrow is my session with Rene. Tomorrow I'll stop by the pharmacy and buy my medication. Tomorrow I might get my report. I might use it. I can show it to them.

Catherine told me how her therapist published the same offer again. Now it's not just a receptionist, it's an assistant who would manage her agenda and maybe apply some evaluations. Half time, a thousand pesos every two weeks. This time it didn't specify being just for students.

Why did I feel pressure? Why was I scared? Why wouldn't I call? I don't want to ask it by phone. It's easier to deal with rejection by an e-mail or just silence. On the phone is actually saying it: "I'm Ivan and I need your help."

And then expecting and answer.

I am not Ivan. I don't want to keep saying it. I feel trapped in my own lie.

It would had been better if her parents would had never known me as her boyfriend.

### 2016-03-30

This week I will tell my dad. This week I'll make an appointment to the laser place on monday. I want to start. I need to start.

Rene didn't print me his report but he showed it to me. He apologized for putting Ivan as the name. It hurt, reading it. Reading the name and the sex and then reading the history of my feelings and fantasies. "Has thought about wearing his mother's clothes". "Sometimes dresses in women's clothes and wears make up".

It's a report. It's just something that he has to do. I can understand it.

This morning I decided to wear something feminine. I shaved thoroughly and wore make up. I thought about wearing the leggings but instead put on some jeans. In the morning I tied a scarf around my neck. I cut myself in the bathroom shaving. I should had made the appointment. Will I call or will I send another text message? I prefer calling now. Setting the appointment and asking for precise directions to the place.

I don't know how people saw me. Some said good morning, something that they never do. I drove to the pharmacy. The pharmacist received my prescription and looked for the bottles. "Did the young man gave you a card?" asked the woman who would charge me.

I went to Dax and looked at the make up. I bought a new foundation, the same one that is almost empty. I picked some make up removal tissues and some little sponges. All of it I paid. There was no mention of anything in the cashier. No looks, no words.

I saw three different people scan me with their eyes. It was as if their sights were an x-ray machine, looking through me.

With Rene I explained how I can't tell my dad yet. It feels as if I'm cheating. I don't consider giving him a letter, or telling my mom to explain what I told her to him. I have to do it myself as if it were some judge who were looking. As if I don't deserve it, somebody will prohibit me the change.

He turned my words around. What if... what if I can't tell my dad because of this feeling of betrayal, of treason. Is it, that I feel as I've cheated him of his son. Betrayed the relationship he thought he had with him, made him believe something I never was. Is that what scares me of telling him the truth?

It has to be with the fear that I have of telling Catherine's parents. I regret getting them to know me as Ivan, as their daughter's boyfriend. They've known this person, this young man, and I'm not him. They invited him to dinner, to their house, to their table. He played with their nephew and stayed with their daughter. And yet he doesn't exist. He's a lie.

What will happen when they know, when they realize. Will they be angry? Will they be upset? Will his dad resent me?

There is a possibility that they uninvite me from their wedding.

And I wander away from the thought of telling my father. Rene asked me to send him a message when I tell him. It will be something big. His reaction is still something unknown. It might be big, chaotic. Was he trying to be helpful? He's there, he will be there no matter what happens. Maybe he could act as a transferential projection of my father.

Maybe it was his way of pressuring me to do it. Create an expectancy. I might have already the deadline of doing it before next thursday but know there is somebody who knows and expects it. I talked about closing the door behind my back when I enter to my parents room to talk to him. Maybe he's putting himself by my back, both as a support and a pressure.

I stayed with Catherine. Ate again in her house. Her mother made soup. Her nephew was with us. I played with him. He looked for me with his big and innocent eyes. He smiled. What does he look? Everyone sees me as a man, everyone of her relatives know me as "that-Ivan". Will he get to know me like that?

I picked Anahi up from the Burger King and drove her to Catherine's. We stopped in the Oxxo to buy something to drink. The police guard welcomed us strongly. I stayed quiet. Anahi paid and there was no comment, no lady or welcome. Nothing. Like there were no need to say she was a woman. We went to the door and the police looked at me "You have really long hair, man". I just smiled and swallowed my pain down my throat. "Pull it down to see where it reaches", I smiled again but maybe Anahi noticed my discomfort in my eyes. I ignored him and exit.

We saw Paper towns in Catherine's bed. Anahi told us about her date. Tonight won't be the time I tell my dad. Maybe tomorrow. I have a week.

Days keep passing by. I told Anahi about my plans with the laser. Everyone wants to get rid of hairs. They don't have to deal with a beard. Nobody sees them like men.

That's not the point. Three times today I asked my mother what were the plans for tomorrow and the weekend. What answer am I looking for? What is it that I want to know? After my father got home, he went straight to his room. My mother was already there. Even now is early enough for me to go and talk to him, to them.

I've made my speech, I won't repeat it again. It almost feel like cheating at this point. In my words, I mean.

Cheating, that was the interpretation Rene gave me about my reluctance to face him. It's not just tell him. It's facing him, standing in front of him and show myself, open up and let him know me, show him his mistake, correct his wrong idea about me.

It has to do, also, with shattering the future he might had thunk I have.

I have Luis here by my side just know. He's lying in my bed watching some video on youtube. Do I fear the same about shattering the image of his big brother? I don't care about how Miguel thinks about me, why don't I tell him first? Doesn't he look up to me, too?

I did laundry today. First it was my underwear. I remember when I was nervous about cleaning a pair of panties and a bra with the rest of my underwear. I would wait until nobody could see me. I would close the door on hide the garments inside the ball of the rest of my clothes. Over and over would I go and check the timer left. It was impossible for me to forget about it and let the clothes there.

Now, what is it? A year later? two? Now it was some tank tops, three pijama pants and the rest was woman's underwear. Three bras and maybe ten or twelve pair of underpants of different colours. Have I really changed without realizing? I was taking them from the washing machine to the dryer when Luis entered the laundry room.

"What are you doing?" I threw the black pants into the lighted hole. He peeked inside towards the colourful pile of wet clothes.

I tried to cover them and thought: "why?" And why indeed? I keep again and again to cover it, hide it. What would happen had he seen something?

"Is that a brassiere? Why do you have a brassiere in your laundry?" "Those are woman's panties"

Yes. Yes, it is, they are. They are mine. That's the answer that I could have given. That was the only thing needed to be said. Everything coming after that would had been just an explanation.

Maybe that's the only thing I need. Letting me be seen. Letting them see me and explain it.

No. I'm doing it again.

I will do it. Yesterday was the first day. Today, the second. I have a week. I will tell my dad. I need not to pressure myself. I have time. A week is lots of time. More than enough.

I showed Luis a condom. I picked it from the drawer and let him handle it. I, after that, let him know I have a bottle of lubricant. Why wasn't I afraid of that? I play with him about the idea of suppositories and prostate exams. I would feel no shame in telling him, or even my parents that my sex is unconventional. They don't need to know, though. What's the difference then?

What's the difference of them knowing that I like the feeling of being penetrated and dominated to letting them know about how I'm not really a man. I am a woman. Inside.

The words of Rene's report keep coming back. Reality's idea. Self-perception. The subject commits himself to the idea of pertaining to the female gender.

It reads so clinical and impersonal. I answered Jessica's question yesterday, too. She hadn't written anything after confirming Chevo's comment. She asked me, taking names out, who would be the person she would be in front of next time we would see each other.

I let Catherine know of the messages, the things said. Something in Jessica's made her feel something, too. "It's like what you're going through goes over her head. Like she's unable to comprehend. I feel her agressive.

She answered back and told me that they would visit Catherine next Wednesday. If I wanted to see them alone we could see each other, today they would leave work after 6pm.

Wednesday would be fine. I will meet Rene and get his report. Anahi asked me if I wanted to cross the border and going with her to target Tuesday.

Maybe Saturday we will go to the united states and maybe we will spend the weekend in Mexicali, too.

Every day gets filled. I don't think I'll make the appointment to the laser's this next week.

Now it really is just one week. I'm nervous. I really am.

But I'm even more excited.

## April, 2016

### 2016-04-01

I actually believed for a minute that I would have told my father today. I guess this will be another missed day.

I woke up later, as usual. It was hard opening my eyes, stop turning looking for another minutes of rest. I took my pills and stepped out of my room to see what was happening in their lives. My mother was having breakfast so I ate what was left in the stove. She has this habit of making a little more food than usual. She's used to cook food for more people besides her. She has never lived alone.

For a year she lived outside her hometown. There she lived with a friend and a family. When she came back and married my father, actually younger than I am now, she lived with him, her lover.

I haven't lived alone either. I lived with roommates in another country. It was a little like living alone but not really.

It doesn't matter. I ate breakfast and lied down on the couch. Catherine sent me a text message telling me that she had just gotten news of Liliana. She had two patients ready for an evaluation. Why did Liliana keep contacting Catherine? Why not me? I remembered how she's still in bed. It would be me the one who would attend them. I don't like treating children, but it's work.

I'm excited and full of energy a total opposite of how it was before. I showered in wait of the call. I decided for her to give them my phone instead of the other way around. All is set. I will see them tomorrow at 1 in the afternoon. It will be an interview with the parents. I maybe should had looked for an structured format to be prepared. One hour. I can charge them 400 pesos or 200 dollars for the whole procedure.

I dreamed with Monica today. It was again the same school of my childhood, the one Luis actually is attending now. Six years I spent in there. It's more than 10 years ago and yet I keep dreaming with that building. Three floors. I was looking for a room, for something. I don't remember that part.

I just remember the scene of me looking for her, waiting for her. She was wearing a skirt, was it blue like in high school? She wasn't a kid. Both of us weren't. I turned and her skirt was clipped on her waist. Except when I turned it wasn't. Her crotch was exposed. She wasn't wearing any underwear. Her skin was as pale as I remembered, there was no hair surrounding her vulva. She quickly covered herself. There was no comment. I can't remember the rest.

All day was getting prepared mentally about the meeting, and the battery of tests and the evaluation.

That and telling them.

Miguel decided not going to the gym. I was going to take him. It was a relief. I showered anyway. My hair is dry now, undone, just tied.

Tomorrow they will cross the border without me. I have work, I have a patient. It feels... great.

Not telling them, on the other hand, it's a huge weight. This secret, I've been getting used to it's toll. But the pressure of telling them before the time comes, it's a whole other issue.

Rene was right. I'm scared and feeling guilty of cheating my own father of his son. I feel like I have betrayed him and keep doing so every day he doesn't know. I have to tell him and tell him right. I have to face him and confess.

On the other hand I am scared. I have seen myself in those pictures. I have seen myself with make up and a dress. I have seen my face. I have seen me and felt hideous. He sees me now every day and sees his son. When I tell him he might see me as I see myself in those pictures. He might see me as hideous and monstrous as I look in the reflection. And there is no coming back. After he knows I can't take the words out of his ears, I won't be able to take the image of me out of his eyes.

And so I continue being scared. I was in his room and knelt down on his bed and started chatting. It's way easier for me to tell him about something I am proud of. "Look, I got a job" I have something to do. I am not useless.

Miguel came in and I dropped the will of blurting it.

Right now I have the words inside of me. I promised Catherine I would write a letter. I might just give it to him. I should
start writing it.

### 2016-04-02

I'm right here in the same couch of my uncle's house. We are all gathered in this sort of living room or meeting room with the tv on. There is always a movie playing and being ignored. Everyone is talking with somebody. I'm here with my words. There is a smell of popcorn in the air.

I was going to have a meeting with my patients. The alarm was set on 10 and a half in the morning. I postponed it by 10 minutes. A couple of moments before its time, my phone started singing. I answered and there was a male voice introducing itself. For a moment I thought he was with Telcel. I waited a while until he said he had a meeting with me. He had a job inconvenience so he would had to postpone. It was fine. It was better for me. I could go to the united states with my parents. I will see them next Tuesday. Two days before my appointment.

I haven't talked with my dad. Today I was in my grandmother's house. I was lying on her bed, Luis by my side. My father was nowhere on sight. I asked for him and my mother told me he was outside. Miguel said he was in the car. I stepped outside. It was dark. There was nobody on the street. The car was dark, too. Not a single light on. I could see the drawing of the shadow of my dad. He was asleep, resting.

I thought about it a lot. I wanted to, didn't I? I could had gone outside, opened the door and sat in the copilot seat. Maybe he would be scared. "What happened?" he might ask. Did you need something?

"They see worse things today" My cousin went to see the Deadpool movie. "And that homosexual thing they showed us, Ranma 1/2, the which converted to a woman in the night."

Yeah, of course they would say something like that. Why does it keep surprising me even now?

My mother again reacted. No, it's not like Rene said. She wasn't testing nothing, she was being carried by the social pressure. She jokes about stuff to be funny. She gets defensive and uses stupid jokes to ease the tension. Looking for approval? It doesn't matter. It doesn't change shit.

"No", I would tell my dad. Of course I would back out. I would get scared, my heart pumping furiously, hitting my chest. Maybe a couple of minutes would pass in the darkness, me hating myself and my dad trying to get back to sleep.

One of two things would happen. Either I would had stayed silent indefinitely until leaving the car or I would start talking.

"I did want to tell you something..." By then my heart would be unstoppable. I would actually fear it leaving my body.

"...it's about therapy".

It wasn't the right time. My mother could had gone out at any moment. I don't know how he would react. Time is still running. The day is closer than ever. It's less than a week.

Yesterday I could not sleep. Tossing and turning were both the thought in my head and my body in the sheets. How could I say it. How could I force me to talk about it. Three times I stepped inside their room, at the feet of the bed. I wanted to say it, talk about it, scream it. I wanted to be seen and heard but I'm scared of what they will see.

My father didn't laugh at the joke about the cartoon. My aunt did see it. She explained it a little to my mom.

One, two, three in the morning. The night was running, as well. Even at noon I was afraid of not getting to the meeting. I took my phone out and started writing. I told Catherine I would write a letter. I still have it here in my computer. aiWriter is open; there is a window with a short text I could use as back up. I discarded that idea.

"Will you print it?" she asked. Something about that idea she didn't like. I can see it. It's impersonal, artificial. I thought about writing it, but what if it's illegible? What if he doesn't understand?

So there at night the idea came up again. There was a box in the shelf over the bed. There lies my plaque and the one of my parents. I didn't give it to them. There was an opportunity. I could write a note with it thanking them for their support, asking for it more. Telling them I need them.

I fell asleep thinking about that idea. Today I will sleep in this house, hundreds of kilometers away from both the plaque, the unwritten note and the room in which I've imagined telling them all these nights.

### 2016-04-03

I took the plaque out. It's here besides me in the desk. We've arrived from the United States. My stomach is upside-down. I feel my heart beating in my throat. I want to tell them now. Everyone is in their bedroom. I just help putting the cover to the iron board. I feel like the air I'm breathing is not enough. I have this words inside of me and their burning, poisoning me.

I have to tell them today. I will...


I deleted the words. I was going to cheat but I have an hour still.

I did. I finally opened up. I could hear the disappointment in his voice. Something that he said broke me. I could not see his eyes.

"You will make your life very difficult. Have you think this through?" That was the first thing that worried me about telling him. I know his pessimism and doubt. I know his worries. I knew this would happen and waited for it. Even then I was not prepared to fight for my decision.

"It's not something that I thought yesterday. I've been thinking this through for 2 years and a half."

I defended it with an iron wall. I was going to be unmovable. At first I even considered saying it: "I just wanted to tell you, I wanted you to know. I felt this inside of me, burning me and I wanted to take it out."

I was going to continue, but fortunately stopped and let them talk. "Now that you know, I don't care if you support me or not. Now that you know, that's all that I wanted." Those words got lost in the silence.

"Don't do something foolish... I don't know what would happen if I knew you ever do something stupid... Don't give up... the world is hard..." At first I thought he was referring to my decision as foolish. At first, maybe he was. Changing your body. Everything will be harder. Doing something permanent.

Those were his words in the first half. By the second one he was telling me over and over to not give up and that he would never care what other people say. I was his son and would always be his son. Those words hurt me and yet comforted me. I wasn't going to ask him to change his way of talking.

I talked about the appointment. This thursday I will go and won't have to be alone.

I feel like crying. I talked about looking for a job, being denied.

I had never seen my father cry before. Just remembering his eyes watering makes me want to crawl in bed and bawl my own eyes out.

But it's done. It's over. He knows. She knows. My mother talked about my brothers but I won't rush it. She mentioned the kids part. I talked about my own life versus the one drawn by other people's expectations.

I told him about my depression, how I felt. How it was. I explained antidepressants, their methods.

He's proud of me. I'm excellent at what I do and have a brilliant future ahead of me. And then repeated his words. "Don't give up".

He corrected me furiously. "You're not alone, don't ever say you were alone."

Silly dad, of course I was. Inside of my mind I lived, hidden from the world. I might had not been trapped like the stereotype says, but I was hidden and alone. Nobody knew about me, not even myself. Years I was alone, unseen.

I didn't come back from Spain. Their son went there and died. He was dying before leaving here. His dead was announced on my 21st birthday. When I was in Spain he perished and I surfaced. Just Catherine knew about me and saw me.

I was scared of coming back, taking his life, meeting my family, letting me be seen. So I hid in his skin. I played his part again. I ignored the only witness who knew about my existence. I abandoned her. Miraculously she never gave up on me. She always stood there waiting for when I returned. And I did, and I love her and she loves me. And he's right. I'm not alone, she will always be by my side.

And now I will have them, too.

She hesitated on some pronouns by half of her talk. I still won't ask her yet. Luis and Miguel will be a piece of cake from now.
Everything from here seems so easy. The changes are now welcome.

### 2016-04-04

"Yesterday I told my dad. I'm fine. I'll see you this Wednesday. Will I pay you something extra for the report?"

I sent him the message this morning. He asked me to tel him when I talked with my dad. Was he worried for me or was he expecting it for the report?

There are a a couple of blank sheets of paper besides me, on top of the Human Development text book.

I asked Hilda if she took the class about child psychopathology. She enlisted for me the tests they reviewed in that class. I have their names and authors. As they used them for the battery of their own patients, there ought to be a way to get them. I don't have to look for them just now. Tomorrow I'll meet with the parents and offer the evaluation.

I don't have to offer them anything. They are the ones who are consulting me. They looked for me. They looked for somebody and Lili sent them my way. They are asking for my services. They are the ones reaching out, not me.

I can name my own price and they have to decide if take it or not. I won't be offering, just naming it. How much is my work worth? I know my last work was higher than 250 pesos. Five labor days of the minimum wage here in Mexico. I researched and graded.

None of my colleagues would do what I did. I used a test even some of my teachers don't know.

Nothing will I gain for throwing myself flowers. They might deny me or just don't come back. Patients always leave. Last night I rehearsed how I would talk to them, explain how would things go. I talked towards my white wall as if he could give me feedback. "Yeah, that's great. Sure you will get them. You are awesome".

I had a headache. This pulsing pressure just inside of my forehead. I had told Anahi what had happened. I had a conversation over the phone with Catherine. My voice was calmed and tired. I wanted to cry as I changed the sheets before lying in bed.

I visited her today. I took Miguel to the gym. My mother was supposed to be at the salon but as I came down from the shower I met her sitting in the kitchen table. I drove him anyway. I shaved and wore a bra under my shirt. I didn't feel the need to put on make up.

I don't think I'll wear any Wednesday either. I know I will cry with Rene. What will I wear Thursday? How should I meet the dr? I think about going as androgynous as I can. Jeans and a t-shirt and the black long sweater.

I'll think about that later. Today is 4th. Just three more days. Yesterday I told my dad. Tomorrow I will have my second consultants. The day after that I will receive my report and then, the appointment.

I am nervous. I am scared. I won't deny it. I am anxious, too. Excited as I have ever been.

"I don't know if we're not talking again. Months ago when I told my mom I wrote to you. Yesterday I talked with my dad. You might not care, I felt like telling you anyway."

I talked with her ghost as I was driving in the freelane from dropping Miguel to Catherine's house. I said that line and turned as if I could see her. More than a hundred and fifty days with a break inbetween. I deleted her from my contacts. Both my mother and brothers still have her. She might had seen the pictures from them. Has she noted my absence? Does she care?

"Do I change the name I have in whatsapp?"

I had thunk about changing the picture, the name. Putting on Sofia, setting an even more feminine snap of my face.

What would I gain? My contacts know already. In my cellphone the names of my contacts appear as I have them in my address book. Nobody might even notice. Do I feel nervous still? What is it that scares me?

I put on Sofia in snapchat. My aunts possible saw it.

Does my mother have me in Whatsapp? Does she even use it? Does Jessica? Hilda?

I won't create a new Facebook until I take the first pill. I have decided that. I don't know how will it work.

If I change the name, would Monica notice? Would I sent her a message still?

### 2016-04-05

"Confirming today's appointment at 1"

When I read her message I sensed I had made a huge mistake not confirming to them.

I woke up several times in the morning. The first times where around 8. I looked at the phone and saw a couple of notifications. Monica had answered my message. I did send it. I had changed the name and the picture. "I feel weird, I don't know, like exposed, vulnerable". The feeling wasn't enough so I reached out for her. In the morning I saw her "what did he tell you?".

Catherine and Anahi said other things about tomorrow's visit. I will see her after my session. I don't feel like parking far away and walking the couple of blocks to Rene's. I don't know if I should shave tomorrow or until Thursday. Tomorrow I know I won't wear any make up. I plan to cry tomorrow, to tell Rene and tell him my worries and cry, because I feel like doing that. I am nervous and a little scared. I told my parents, they know, they are assimilating it. Miguel might suspect it and I doubt Luis has no idea. There is no reason any more for the report to not be tomorrow. Without its absence and the lack of my parents knowledge, I don't know what may make the endocrinologist to reject me for treatment.

I have my father's words stuck in my ear still. What will Rene say? Will he say something about me reaching out to Monica? I don't feel guilty about it. I did nothing wrong. Why don't I tell Catherine?

What will I wear, both tomorrow and the day after? What image do I want to give to the dr? How do I want him to see me? I shared with Catherine my worry and uneasiness about asking for Ivan's appointment for Hormone Replacement Therapy. On top of that, will I meet them with skinny pants and a made up face? Do I want to be a walking contradiction? What voice will I use? I listened to today's audios from when I was driving home. The voice is different to the one I hear inside of my own head. It's different to the one I imagined when I didn't dare to listen.

What was I going to wear today wasn't such an enigma. I took the square printed pants from the closet yesterday. The shirt was still undecided but unimportant. I showered. Did I shave? What would be the point to that? I don't think so. Exiting the wet room I put on the underwear and pants. There was no bra. It felt like a skipped step in a habitual routine. I didn't shave the face either. I had more time than I thought I would need.

I kept chatting with Monica and exchanging funny pictures with Eusebio. I waited for the time of the meeting with my consultants. I rehearsed what I would say the last couple of days. It wasn't really a surprise when they didn't show up. I had thunk about it. I told Catherine how I felt different this time. I remember when I was waiting for my first paying patient. She was late and I started getting anxious. I feared her abandonment. As my heart ran faster and faster and my mind filled with sadness and self-pity I heard her greeting.

I knew this time wouldn't be the same. If they didn't show up, yeah, of course it would be a disappointment but the world would not end.

Just now I turned towards the door and remember another of my father's words. "Don't bury yourself in your room. Don't isolate yourself. I remember asking you what was wrong. If something had happened". Was it guilt? Did he feel guilty about my melancholy? He is not a bad father. He has never been nothing less of ideal.

I arrived to Liliana's.

No, I was talking about earlier than that. I tied my hair tight in a bun behind my head. I sent a picture marked as "today I will be a boy". It was fine. It didn't hurt. I got to the gas station and was greeting by a sir, and mr, and young man. They didn't hurt either. I didn't enjoy them, but I certainly did not mind.

I was with Liliana, chatting, waiting. She would be my secretary for the day.

They just didn't show up. She will cal them. She might refer me another patient later. A young teenager.

I... I feel fine. And yet my leg is restless.

And my thoughts bouncing from here to there. I keep thinking of tomorrow's session and Catherine's house. Then it's finally three months after my birthday. The day I waited for so much. The day is closer than ever.

### 2016-04-06

I received a message from Johanna. I remember my picture and the changed name. I know that maybe not in every phone it will appear the change. Did it in hers? Has she noticed? I scanned through her words for a mention of it and yet nothing appeared. I read it superficially and ignored it.

I had the phone over my bag beside me in Rene's couch. I was talking to him when it kept ringing and ringing. I had it outside because of what happened earlier while I was showering.

Yesterday Catherine and I talked about Monica. The comparison and parallels between the time we started dating and continued talking with Monica and Anahi's relationship with Ricardo and his ex-girlfriend Carmen.

"Will you tell me when you talk to her? I'm not asking you to tell me what you talked about. Just, you know, not hide it".

I kept silent. I hate

her?

I put the song I used to repeat while we were exchanging videos on youtube. I hate you. Catherine looked at me. I had told her about Monica before Anahi arrived.

I woke up today and skipped the alarms one by one. I didn't have to get up until 11. Tomorrow will be another story. Tomorrow...

The day is here, now. I am nervous as hell. My head keeps looking for reasons why everything might turn to shit.

I took my clothes to the bathroom, brushed my teeth. Did I touch myself today? I stayed in the shower room, my hair dripping wet. I did. I finished and exhaled.

I shaved, too. I decided to skip the bra. I did wear Catherine's pants with a t-shirt and a hoodie. When I came down from the bathroom, there was a notification on my phone. Two missed calls. The application that shows me the name of the registered number showed "Francisco Magallanes". It was just one number different to the one I called three months ago. It was his office. Were they confirming the meeting? Maybe something changed? I returned the call twice. The weird sound of old routers answered me. I hung up.

I waited outside Rene's office. I was early. I parked my car.

...
I'm fixating on the past. Is it that I am reluctant to think about the future? I am on an edge and yet I'm talking about today. I could summarize it in a couple of sentences. I received a message from Johanna. Rene gave me my report. I went to Catherine's and Anahi was with us later in the evening. That's it...

Tomorrow I have an appointment with the endocrinologist. I will have to wake up in the morning and get ready and go to a clinic I've never gone before. I will tell a complete stranger my secret. I will hand to him a report with the information that took me months to be able to tell my own father. In his hands lies my future. He can deny me and I'd be lost. He can say no to me, tell me to wait.

I don't know how doctors treat people like me. He might be kind and nice, he might be an asshole and a bigot.

I don't know. I don't know what will happen in his office, what will I say, what will he?

Whenever I arrive, will the secretaries guide me to his office? Will I have to wait a lot? Will I wait to see him? Will I wait for treatment? Will it be weeks? months?

Just thinking about it makes me feel nervous. I am anxious. The report states that I am fine dealing with frustration, I know the treatment will be multidisciplinary, I know it will be long and slow.

I know, I do know. Why do I keep ignoring it? I want to start. I want to stop disfiguring myself. Two years have passed already. I went and returned from Europe. I went and returned from this. I've told my parents, I've changed my name in the phone.

I fear not being able to get up in the morning and yet I think I won't be even able to sleep.

Thoughts keep spinning and spinning inside of my head. I feared not telling my dad and that is done. I was scared of Rene not giving me my report. I have it in my bag, ready and signed. The appointment has come. The only thing left is waiting. Going and facing him.
Wait and see.

### 2016-04-07

I was drowning in nervousness. Three alarms were set in my cellphone. The first one woke me at 6 in the morning. I stayed awake until minutes before the second one. The first rays of sunlight ignited my anxiety. Today was going to be the day which I had waited for all year. What would happen today?

My mother and Luis left home. I took the clothes that I had set aside and walked upstairs to the bathroom. I showered and shaved. Closely I tried to get every single hair. I didn't want them to see me as a man. I wanted to be surprised, be unrecognizable even though they would not know me. I wanted to look like a woman to fool them when they asked for my name.

And I did put them on. I shaved with my bare torso. I stepped out and returned to my room topless. In my room I hooked my bra in my back. I looked into the mirror and accepted the image. I even did my hair that way. It's the longest I've stayed like that.

I did put make up. It was subtle just a hint to hide the darkness of my face. A little to open my eyes. My voice was kept the same.

I drove. I knew the way, I had checked it the day before.

"Ivan... with the change of name, will there be a way to change your diploma? It's done. There ought to be a way, doesn't it?"

I took the wrong turn. No, I actually missed it. It was raining. I changed my shirt home. I ended up going as I would had gone to the Universal Studios hadn't I forgotten my sweater.

After circling around I got there. The problem was now finding where to park. Another round and I did. Walking in the rain, my hands were shaking with fear. What was I scared of?

"I have an appointment with the Dr Magallanes..."

She confirmed by that name and gave me a piece of paper to fill with my information.

A group of people entered to the waiting room and the receptionist gave them a similar one. "It's a problem with their identity" said one of them. "It's because they don't know who they are..." he kept going about someone they know who never had a girlfriend. Were they talking about that because of me? Hearing steps from the other side of the door made my heart race.

When it finally was for me, I was relieved that the receptionist didn't call out my name. Whatever they thought about seeing me there, it wasn't confirmed by the "you can come in, sir" or "Ivan Fernandez? The dr will see you now".

"So, what can I do for you?" and so it began everything. There were questions and confirmations. "The matter of the name", I said it. He changed it in the file. Everything went smoothly and cordially. It was actually nice meeting him.

"How did your parents take it?" They actually took it very well. I confirmed it when he asked the next question. "There is no violence, right?".

Fuck. Sometimes I forget that some people do fear being hit and thrown out of their homes.

There was something before that, before leaving. I put the Daily show because of the glimpse I caught when I asked my father to move the cars. "Transgender people" said the captions. The whole theme of the show was about people like me. "How does it feel being the focus of such hate?, let's find out". That was what my father saw yesterday.

He checked me, physically. He didn't ask me to undress, although he did see my bra. "Do you have breasts?, or is it the bra? ...oh you fill it... well, they come like that".

"Have you taken hormones before?" "Perfect, it's really good that you brought these, because I was actually going to send you for one. Now we can start with the medical procedure..."

After the examination, back in the chairs and the desk, he took a piece of paper and filled with the information of the test I will take.

Tomorrow I will get my blood drained. An analysis of hormones and other shit. How am I. "Let's see how you are so I can pick the best treatment for you".

I am scared and nervous. I am surprised that I haven't cried.

I told Johanna. I replied to her messages. I told her about me, how I'm feeling, how I felt. She... she didn't answer.

My parents know about my tests. They were to the bank. My father wanted to call and ask for the price. He asked me for the order. I gave it to him. Sofia Fernandez said in the top. Did he see?

Maybe, probably.

Will it hurt me?


My next appointment is the 15th. It will be in the morning. The hour is pending. That day he might give me the prescription.

That actually might be the date. I don't know which of those days, tomorrow or the 15th, scares me the most.

### 2016-04-08

I have high cholesterol and and a high level of blood glucose. My linfocites are a bit high, too, but almost insignificant.

My testosterone levels are in the normal range but high up there. I told Catherine, if they were low, it could mean a reason for my behavior. It they were high, that would mean the changes coming from lowering them would be drastic.

Why do I feel like shit, then?

She's right. I have done a lot for me, I should forget about the world. I went to the endocrinologist, I did the analysis. Now it's just waiting a week so he will give me something. Will he tell me to lower my cholesterol first or the glucose? I am in a risk state of diabetes. I don't drink soda, I don't eat candies.

That is not what has been worrying me.

I began writing avoiding the idea of starting narrating the day, and yet I haven't even mentioned what's on my mind.

Yesterday the dr wrote the order for the studies by my name. I felt glad. It was different, for the first time I had something physical with that name. I am that, this person, I thought. There was a hint of fear, though. At first I just attributed it to my distaste for needles. I slept so little it barely almost counts. Time passed so slowly between 3am and 6. I checked the phone maybe 20 times hoping the alarm were far away.

I imagined this room almost empty, a receptionist and an exam room. Nothing more... just one person who would know about me.

From my seat in the parked car I could see the place. There was a man standing in the door. Three receptionists in the counters and several people in white coats walking from a place to another. Various patients were there already, waiting.

The order said Sofia. I didn't put it. I wouldn't dare to write it and present it. I had a bra under my shirt but it wasn't enough. I shaved yesterday so I skipped this morning. I wouldn't put make up on my face for a half hour.

The man from the door asked me several questions. Day of birth, age, when the time came to the sex, he skipped it. I was interested in seeing what he would put. He hid the table from me. They would call my name so I sat. They sure did. After calling everyone before me by their full name, my turn came.

"Patient Fernandez Lozano?"

I raised my hand shyly. I heard the doubt in her voice.

Just remembering this I feel the tears clouding my vision. Before reading the results I was excited and thrilled. What changed since then? Is it really the cholesterol and glucose? Am I ashamed because I should be healthier?

I had seen the answer by then. I looked towards the paper and saw the M.

"Excuse me, what's your name? ..."

Did I really have to answer it? I was scared, I wanted to run. It was just a fraction of a second. "Is it Sofra?".

I smiled, as trying to tell her "no, I know it's stupid, I'm sorry, it wasn't my intention, the dr wrote it down. I know I don't deserve it yet". Instead, my lips told her "Sofia".

"Sofia, yeah, right." She gave me a bottle to be filled with urine and asked me if it was my first time going to that lab. She gave me a card of discounts. My name is written in its back. I was excited about that, too.

Exiting from the bathroom I gave the full bottle to a woman who extended her hand to reach it. "They will call you in a minute" she told me in the masculine formal 2nd person. She didn't see the name. How funny that then it was what hurt me the most, and now after everything, it's the encounter that I least think about.

I waited in my chair trembling of fear. Another woman grab the last piece of paper remaining and called my name. I stood up and followed her. She took my blood. It didn't hurt as much as I remembered it would.

Everything was over really fast. I drove home. The results would be online after 5pm. They were since 2 in the afternoon but I checked them just an hour ago.

And there it was, my name, by birthdate and my gender.

The card with my name will always be attached to that information. I will always be masculine. It doesn't matter what I put in my body or the changes I will experience. To them I was, and always be, the man with a female's name. I am the man named Sofia and that is what's been hurting me the most.

### 2016-04-09

I wrote my words early yesterday. It was in the early afternoon, 5 o'clock, I think. I wanted them to be done so I could stop worrying about it and just go to sleep. And so I did. I talked about what were on my mind, the initial shock about seeing the sex marked as masculine just besides my name. It was confusion. I would had put it anyway. Even if asked I would not had lied to them. Even if put female I would had corrected them. So what was it really the thing that made me upset?

I kept going back to being there, recalling their words, their faces and reactions. The questions of the guy, the way they called my name, how I was seen again and again. The M made sense. The question about my name. They saw me as me, the real me. Not the me I sometimes ramble about. The transgender person me.

Every person who saw, not just me but my file too, noticed. The first thing seen was the in-congruence. I was Sofia but a man. A man with a woman's name. The receptionist confirmed it. They gave me the card anyway. They didn't ask for my "real" name. They were nice. What would I had preferred?

And so I kept thinking over and over: my file will always be the same. I will always be on their archive as Sofia Fernandez Lozano, born on january seventh of 1993, and male. My age will keep changing, but it won't matter the hormones or physical changes I get, my file will always have "Male" as it will always have my birth date.

I will always be a man with a woman's name. To them, at least.

With that thought I went to sleep as soon as the clock marked 7. An hour or two later I woke up and eat three tacos. Then would I get back to bed. And I slept and dreamed.

I woke in the early morning and typed my dream to Catherine. Anahi was driving a car and I was with her, just the two of us. We were supposed to be in the United States but when I looked out of the window I recognized Tijuana. She lied to me and said we were going to be to Ikea so she could buy a gift for Catherine and me. she admitted to me that we were in Tijuana and we would cross soon somewhere near, she took this path because it would be faster. I asked her if we could go to Target. She accepted telling me how she had said before she really like the clothes there, maybe she could buy something. I told her I wanted to buy something as well. Anything, I didn't really mind what. I had this need of having something feminine, validating, as if a garment of clothes could change the way I were feeling.

I started feeling this tingling between my legs and went down. The familiar sensation of nearing climax. I had no stimulation, the thoughts were sad, the feelings were the opposite of erotic. I was surprised, confused and ashamed. I tried to cover my pants with my arm so she would not see. I put the left one over my left leg as it started to get wet. I turned and, before seeing her reaction, woke up.

In a rush I checked myself with my fingers. Nothing, if I were fast enough I could go to the bathroom and avoid something embarrassing.

It was then that I recalled the scene. Again I was on the left seat and yet was the copilot. Anahi was driving the car as if it was a British one.

Today we went to the United States. We ate in Denny's. I told both of my parents the results of my test. I've decided to take more care of what I eat. I could go to run or do something physical. I want to lose weight, be smaller. I want to be healthy.

I ate salmon and vegetables, a bowl of soup and one taco. I've drunk unsweetened iced tea, a tall cup of iced coffee and glasses of water.

Will those changes last? Even with time will they have an effect?

I am terrified of staying the same. It doesn't matter how much I lose weight I keep getting it back. It doesn't matter how different I look I returned. Maybe that has to do with what has been scaring me.

I have my new glasses on. They're smaller and clearer. I actually like them unlike the pair I chose here.

### 2016-04-10

The day before I had slept more than I should. Yesterday I woke up early to go to the United States. Was it really yesterday? Yes, today is Sunday, the last day of the week. I went to bed but could not fall asleep. I was chatting with Catherine on the phone. Around midnight I stopped answering her texts and turn around. I needed to sleep, otherwise I would wake up late and fall into another insomnia cycle.

After one in the morning the dog from the house next street started barking. An exchange of sounds between the dogs in the neighborhood. I could barely hear the answers it received, but its responses were as loud as if it were lying besides my own bed. Half an hour, maybe a little more I could not take it anymore and stood to close the window. Even then it was difficult for me to catch slumber.

I woke up before my father arrived from his morning coffee. I heard the sound of his pick-up, the rattling of the keys in the keyhole, and the murmurs of the paperbags over the table.

I ate my breakfast trying to take more time than I am accustomed to. I measured my bites before taking them. Leave the food on the table until you're finished with your mouthful. I drank a glass of water with it.

Nobody but me and my dad were in the living room. Miguel was still asleep, Luis, too, maybe. My mother was upstairs. Before coming back to my room my mom came down. I lied down under my sheets and went back to sleep. It was a rest so delicious I would pay normally to have it every night.

From eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon I slept and dreamed.

I showered and visited Catherine in her home. I decided not to shave. I used the machine but it's useless. I had thunk about wearing a bra but it was pointless, too. I asked my dad to move the cars and drove. I have returned from there. We watched netflix on her room. I touched her and she made me cum. We kissed over and over.

I feel weird and I told her just now.

I was hungry, we shared a bag of chips. I ate a slice of pizza and half of a portion of spaghetti. Over there I drank nothing but water. I should be proud, I was taking care of my eating. I could be losing weight. Coming here, though, I did save the ciabatta my parents bought me into the fridge. Nonetheless, with a fork I devoured more than half of an order of spaghetti. I am full, now. I have nothing to be proud for today.

That's not it. She talked with me yesterday about my reaction to the blood results. She's right. I've gone to the endocrinologist. I took the tests. Now it's just waiting. Next week I might get the prescription. It might start sooner than I would have thought. The weight is no longer in the years or even months.

Why do I feel empty and hollow?

I haven't call to the laser place. I have to do that still. I received the mail for picking up the certificate of my Honor's mention. I have to make an appointment with the doctor so I get my license. I haven't gotten any news about neither of the two trips I might do this year.

After the prescription, what is it? I take my pills and then what? Just wait for the changes. It will be different, though. I will had already started with the changes. A wait before then means prolonging the change, staying here, in the limbo. After that day, the days keep counting, one by one will be increasing into weeks and months. Little by little will I change. Every step I'll be closer.

What is it, then? Why ain't I excited? Why do I feel the days so void of anything? It feels like there is nothing in here, nothing to do, to eat, to see. I came back to bed so the tomorrow could come earlier.

I told Catherine tomorrow I would call the laser place. I have to, I will. I'll make an appointment whenever they have a chance.

"Catherine, I don't know when it will happen, but would you like to be with me when I take my first pill?"

She wasn't expecting that question.

The more I think about that moment, the more I let myself be excited I get nervous and paranoid somebody is planning something to take it away from me.

### 2016-04-11

Days keep coming and going. Yesterday I lamented the hollowness of my days and the difficulty of waiting for empty days to end.

Just today I've filled my week completely. In the morning I woke up with the rays of the sun illuminating my bedroom. I was tired and exhausted, I longed for more minutes of rest. The calm of sleep and the comfort of the dark silent were seducing me with their charms. I wasn't able to sleep, though. A couple of minutes past and I gave up. It was 9, maybe a couple of minutes shy of 10. I checked for the number of the laser place, and its schedule. I could call but it was too early. I talked to Catherine and commented her my fear.

"I want to call but there is something impeding me to. I get frustrated with myself. I hate being this coward".

She told me I could call by 11;30. I stayed in the couch and watched tv. I want to eat less. I want to lose weight, be slender. I want my muscles to atrophy and disappear. I want my beard to be gone. I gathered the courage to dial the number and call. A mechanical voice in my cellphone warned me I had no credit. Right...

Those seconds gave me a chance to be caught up by my own fear. I grabbed the house phone and call from there. I have the appointment. Tomorrow noon. She offered me 11 or 12. I picked midday. She advised me to shave today. No cream or anything, just my face clean and ready. I am scared. I have been applying kanka to my mouth sore to get accustomed to the pain. "A rubber band slap to the face" they describe it. It's heat penetrating and burning a hair follicle, several at the time.

It's a little pain but it'll make this shadow disappear. It's the beard what screams masculinity. I don't mind my face, I don't even mind much of my body. It's the facial hair that I compulsively cut and hide. 8 or 10 sessions. There is a finite number to it. There is a clear start and finish. I have a date. Tomorrow I'll go and start and a couple of days or weeks later I will see the hairs shedding and falling. When they return a month later I will have another session and they will be gone, too. Every one will leave less hairs than the last, every one will be less painful, too.

I received a message in whatsapp asking if I was the Dr Ivan. I freaked out. It was just a number with a stranger's picture but I knew instantly of whom it was. It wasn't the fear of making an appointment with a patient or the potential of being abandoned again in the consultory, no, this time it was something else.

I never imagined being contacted my patients via whatsapp. I have Liliana presenting me and referring patients as the Dr. Ivan. And then they put this number on the phone and dial as I dialed to the laser place and three months ago to the endocrinologist office. Of course, as I have no credit in my phone I couldn't receive the call from the United States. So they put the number of the "Dr Ivan" in their phone and see the contact of Whatsapp of this Sofia Fernandez. I had changed the picture of me with a blouse and red lipstick to one a little more androgynous. But even then, which name appeared on their phone?

It didn't matter. I answered back and set the meeting. I'll be seeing them this thursday at 6 o'clock in Liliana's office. I have the interview ready from the last patient. I could do some research on some tests for teenagers.

This Wednesday I'll see Rene and talk to him about my meeting with the endocrinologist. I can talk of the waiting, the getting up early and getting ready. Getting lost in the traffic and then the rounds looking for a parking spot. The excruciating waiting in the waiting room, signing the initial sheet and answering the appointment as Ivan. The chat of the people outside, the change of name inside, the comments, the analysis... The day later when I would take the order with Sofia on the name. The fear and anxiety. The uncomfortable kindness of the professionals and seeing the results.

I'll have tomorrow's session to talk about, too...

What will happen? Will I endure the pain?


### 2016-04-12

"why didn't you use the doorbell?"

Several scorching hot needles penetrating and burning inside of my skin.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. I can go to the pharmacy, too. No, I have to do it. There are just two pills left. I ought to go and buy them. After that I will take Catherine out to eat. We will go to the restaurant near her house.

"Sofi, sofi, I told Enrique how you already went to the endocrinologist and he asked me where. I told him to the Hospital del Prado. 'Oh, Magallanes? Francisco Magallanes?' and he started to fangirl for him and tell me he was the best endocrinologist of Mexico and I don't know what else. So I guess you're going through a good path?"

I keep reading the stories about other people like me, the hoops they have to go through. I remember years ago when I read the procedures they kept talking about, and their first meetings with a gender specialist or an endocrinologist or their first laser session. I used to see those things so far away. Letter of recommendation, Informed Consent Clinics, blood tests...

I used to wander through the trans timelines site and looked through people's pictures. I liked looking at the ones of passing people and marvel at their changes. They non-passing one made me feel uncomfortable. I didn't even look to the first ones, I just wanted to see the results. It was as if I wanted to reassure myself that there were people who were happy, who looked fine.

Now, today, it feels so different.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene for the first time before the endocrinologist. I have the report that Rene wrote for me. I called to make an appointment with the endo. I saw him and answered his questions. He has a file of me with my name on it. I went for the blood tests, I have everything ready to start. Just today I had my first laser session. I am just a prescription away from beginning my life. After that the only thing that's left is waiting.

I made the appointment yesterday. I woke up with a fear of the pain I would have to endure. I showered and didn't know what to do with the extra time I had in the shower. I took my antidepressants and ate breakfast. I toasted one of the english muffins and fried an egg. I keep track of the food I eat in this neat app I installed on my phone. Yesterday, according to it, I ate 1650 calories. Today, with that breakfast, an apple, a popsicle and the plate of chicken salad I am still under the limit.

Will I lose weight? I want to, I want to change, the hormones will do some job but they're not magic. I don't want to depend on them. I can manage my diet and exercise. I can go to the laser and keep blasting my beard off.

I got ready and swallowed two advil before leaving home. After putting 350 of gasoline I went to the plaza. Even after stopping at the oxxo and the gas station I was way too early. There was a pharmacy in there. I asked for cell credit but said therapy instead. The lady over the counter was pretty. There was no system either. If the patient tries to call me I won't be able to answer her calls.

There is still another day before the appointment. Tomorrow I can try again.

I got the password of a wifi network and sent messages to both Catherine and Anahi. 15 minutes before my appointment I walked towards the place and hesitated to use the doorbell. I turned to wait a little longer and the lady came to open me up.


I filled this sheet to her with my information. It was weird using this name and signature so different to the last one I used last week. The session was way shorter than I thought it would be, at first a lot less painful, too.

The last places were the hardest. Under my mouth and my upper lip. There it hurt. My eyes watered and I couldn't answer her when she asked if it hurt.

This morning Jessica answered the text I sent both to them about Catherine. It made me mad. I couldn't identify what about it upset me. I shared it with Catherine.

"Hi, hi, I've been asking about her health and even apologized for not going yet. But yes, the problem was that the four of us could not agree on a time, nonetheless we will go just the two of us.
About her loneliness I think it goes deeper than just the company, but it's not my business so I won't get into that. As soon as we go, we'll tell you, ok? ;)"

### 2016-04-13

I saw Rene today. There wasn't much new that I learned this session.

This morning I didn't shave. Just a couple of minutes ago I was lying in the couch watching tv when I felt the beard getting stuck in the neck of my t-shirt. It's been weird. Since the meeting with the endocrinologist I haven't been wearing a bra every day or even applying make up. I've been dressing more androgynous even when not needed.

There was a difference, this friday being received as Sofia, labeled as her, signed with that name to yesterday when I filled the contract and signed it as Ivan.

He commented to me how I looked less anxious, more calm. It's as if everything is easier.

It is.

I showered and parked in the parking lot next to my high school. I walked the couple of blocks. I forgot to wear sunscreen. Will I be affected by the sun? Maybe my skin will stay tinted. Maybe the beard will never really fall. I won't shave tomorrow either. I have to dress formally, no, professionally, to meet the clients and their son. Or is it my client and his parents?

I put credit to my phone in the oxxo near Rene's office. I grabbed a soda from the fridge and paid for everything. "Tell me your hair isn't really like that" "Yes, it is", I answered smiling. "I'm so envious. Mine is neither here nor there".

Would had she said anything if I were wearing woman's clothes? If I had my face painted? Maybe it would had been awkward, she would be uncomfortable. Maybe she would had anyway. I didn't mind it.

Leaving Rene's office I sent a text to Paola. She wrote me in the morning telling me she had news. There will open a new master program of neuropsychology in CUT. I commented her how UABC would give me a master program for free. I considered telling her about my meeting with the specialist. I could. I wanted to.

I did walking down the stairs. "I have news, too", I had said before leaving my house.

"Yesterday I sent you a snap that I had my first laser session. I'm getting rid of my beard forever.

"Last week I had the first appointment with an endocrinologist."

She was surprised and excited for me. She supported me and offered me any help she could give me.

"It's another step that you're taking and I'm so so so proud of you and the beautiful and strong and intelligent woman you are"

I was surprised. It was a warm feeling inside of me. That is what support really is. She was kind and sincere.

I stopped by the pharmacy to buy two bottles of antidepressants. I almost lost the parking ticket. A woman touched me by the shoulder to tell me. I thanked her with my money and bottles and card and wallet in my hands. I drove to Catherine's house. It's the first time in weeks we've gone out. We went to Gourmeli, the recently renamed Pomodoro by her house.

I ate an oriental wrap with soup. She had a sandwich. I told Rene how I've been looking manly. Not manly per se, but, yeah... and it hasn't bothered me as much. I haven't shaved since Monday. Everyone today saw me as a man, for sure. This whole week.

Tomorrow I'll have the session. It will be easy. I've done it several times. It's nothing new. They're paying me to do what I know to do. Everything will be fine. There is nothing to be worried about.

We continued watching Netflix after returning to her home. Her parents and cousin were leaving to Costco. He still smiles when he sees me. Does he like me?

We touched each other. We kissed. The house was alone after her uncle finished eating and we hung her father's uniform. We lied topless in her bed, caressing each other's bodies. I finished in her hand several times. She stopped me the first time I was making her come. When I tried again, her aunt was just arriving.

There is just one episode left of the series we are watching. I think about it, me lying my head on her stomach. She surrounds me with her arm and strokes my back. We're both watching, focused. The emotions of the characters, I can feel them. I can sympathize. It's not just understanding, I can sense his loneliness and pain. It's something new for me. I love sharing this with Catherine.

### 2016-04-14

Catherine wrote a letter. It was not really a letter but a long heartfelt message. She wrote the feelings she's been hoarding for herself towards him. This idea of being lonely, the lack of reciprocity to organizing and moving plans to go see someone.

I haven't shaved still. The hairs area coarse and black. Catherine describes them as "they look burn and thick". There is something, though. I feel they're growing slower. Yeah, they are long but not a week long. And besides, I can't really see the black shadow that marks the growing root. What will happen tomorrow when I shave them off? Will the skin look softer? Will it be smooth?

I don't know what I will wear for tomorrow. I won't be able to meet Catherine and Paola in the morning. I know Paola will meet with her in her house. I was waiting for the doctor's receptionist to call me and inform me of the time of the appointment. I woke up by the alarm of the exercising app I downloaded the day before yesterday. I postponed it. I feel my body broken down, tired. Three days I've been exercising. The activities are not really hard. It's more the absence of condition because of not doing anything lately. It's just 7 minutes. 12 exercises of half a minute each. 10 seconds of rest intersecting each other.

Even that is too much. I can't lift myself from the floor. I can't raise my head to my knees. I am not strong enough, not yet. It's not really the effort the activity needs from me, it's the lack of a goal. There is no goal, just a time. In those 30 seconds I have to give the best of me. I start with my best. Almost a squad every 2 or 3 seconds. I'm exhausted by the next activity. When it's turn of the push-ups, I can't do it. I can't do only 3 in the 30 seconds. Even one is a lot of effort. I might be able to do 7, maybe 10. But if I do those, I won't be able to do the next ones.

They are just 30 seconds, but there is no goal. It's an unreachable finish line. Even 10, 12, 15, they will never be enough. With those setting I would never be able to feel victorious. It's an infinite loop of asking too much of me.

I deleted the app and started another one. This one is easier. one set of 10, then 7 of the next exercise. When the circuit finishes, it's all over again. That's it. Done.

I was washing the dishes when the phone rang. The voice of the receptionist greeted me and told me her business. She was calling to confirm the appointment of Sofia Fernandez tomorrow. The time would be 1pm.

Afternoon. It's too late. It's fine, but I won't be able to meet with Paola. I could go in the morning to Cathy's house. Then, in the noon I would drive to the hospital, maybe the pharmacy and pick Catherine up. From there we could go to the school and to our own house next. It would be three different trips to her house.

The most convenient thing to do is just go directly to the Hospital in the noon. I will give him the results and we will talk about them, he might prescribe me something or explain me the treatment. He maybe will ask me some questions or I don't know. Tomorrow I'll see.

I wanted to go to the university to pick up the invitations if the ceremony of my Honor's mention. This time Catherine won't be my invited. Will my mom go or my dad?

I told my mother I would go today but didn't. The plan was going tomorrow with Catherine, I could wait in line for both our turns. She could verify her documents and I ask for the invitations. From there we would be even.

I am scared... no, it's not fear. I am nervous, excited of tomorrow. I didn't feel comfortable thinking about that because I had the meeting with the parents today. I wanted to get past that before thinking of what would come next.

Now it's done. I finished the interview. I have all the data I need to start looking for and gathering the tests. Next week the application will start. Tests. Family, personality, maybe intelligence.

Tomorrow. Tomorrow we will see Misfits again.

Will tomorrow start the counter again? I don't want to wait for them, expect them. I fear that the more I want them, the larger is the possibility of they not coming.

But I want them, and I expect them, even if I don't want to admit it to myself.

### 2016-04-15

I, again, was nervous waiting to enter and meet him. My appointment was at 1pm. I woke up and showered. Yesterday I wore my long curly hair in a masculine bun. Green pants I haven't worn in a year and a shirt, was the attire I chose. I hadn't shaved either. My beard was days long. It was more than a stubble. Naturally Liliana kept calling me boy and guy. Ivan. There was a situation with the mother and my contact information.

The whole week, this whole week, since Monday that I called to make the appointment with the laser place. Since that shave I had not presented feminine. Today I shaved that week-long beard. I had read how the shadow after the laser sessions is darker, more noticeable. I didn't care. I had my appointment with the endocrinologist today. There was a possibility of today starting hormones. I took a picture with my camera in front of the mirror. In my plans about today I contemplated the idea of going to the pharmacy to buy them.

So there I was, looking for a parking spot. Everywhere was taken. I parked even further away from last week. There was no weird sights. No head turnings. I felt fine. Again, I entered through the wrong door.

I asked the receptionist about my appointment 20 minutes before the time. I knew I would wait. It was fine. I sat and waited.

There were lots of people outside, pharmaceutical sellers, I guess. A woman, older, with a younger one were seated beside me.

When the clocked marked 1, I started getting anxious with every sound I heard from the other side of the door. The first time the receptionist opened the door, it was to call the other woman. I kept waiting. There were another 15 minutes before she opened the door for me.

I was nervous about the results. He welcomed me and we started.

Of course, the glucose and cholesterol. It was alarming, surprising, abnormal. He asked some questions. I answered honestly. He checked the glucose level with a little aparatus of his. Another prick. I wasn't scared. I took it. It didn't hurt, I almost didn't even feel it.

When we returned to the desk he continued. He grabbed another order for studies and started filling it. I would need another one before starting with the treatment. He wrote his cellphone number in a little card and gave it to me. I was going to do the test directly from the hospital. I didn't need fasting. After the results we could agree on another meeting monday or tuesday.

He talked a little about my options of blockers. "Your testosterone is a little high, we will block it with effort". There is the option of the gonadotropine blockers, to affect directly the Luteinizant hormone and cancel the creation of the testosterone. It's an injection once a month or every three months and the taking of the estrogen. The thing is that the medication is expensive.

I've been growing more accustomed to the idea of injections but I don't think I'm really ready for that.

I was dressed and made up. Even then, I decided to come home and pick up the discount card. The drive wasn't long. I got there and this time there were almost no anxiety. I was waiting for them to see what they'd put this time on the sheet. I didn't think about them recognizing me. Of course they would. How many transgender patients would they get? How many of us are even here?

"A man with a woman's name". This time there was no awkwardness. Did the phlebotomist recognize me? Was she the same one? She welcomed me with a smile as I entered. After paying and sorting everything out, she invited me in. She always used feminine pronouns. She was kind and nice. For minute, I actually forgot feeling like a freak. Did she wrote the Masc in gender or was the other woman checking my information from the computer?

She asked me some questions and then drew my blood. This time it was only a little bottle. It was over before I knew it. The results will be ready tomorrow morning. I want to wake up early and pick them up myself.

I drove from there to Catherine's house. I discarded completely the idea of going to the university. I was, I guess, a little disappointed. That's what I feared mostly.

Chevo and Jessica were already there.

"Oh, Ivan, I didn't know who was entering"

Chevo and Jessica told us what's been up lately. They almost broke up.

I told them about my analysis. Jessica asked directly what they were for and I lied to her. Why did I do that?

I could had told her. I decided not to. It's my decision, but even then, why do I feel guilty?

### 2016-04-16

I picked up the results. The alarm was set for 8 in the morning and then every thirty minutes. My father came home late at night with Luis and I assume he went even later to pick Miguel up from his party. It was naÃƒÂ¯ve to think I would had needed to race for the bathroom.

I wanted to shave, I thought about wearing make up. Why? I discarded the idea. I did shave. A couple of black spots came with the water rinsed from the razor. That wasn't enough, though.

I was nervous as I drove there. I had to wake up my father and ask him to move the car. Exiting his bedroom he asked me "where are you going?" "I'll pick up the test results from yesterday.

I was nervous as hell. I had told Catherine, it wasn't the idea of being diabetic that scared me. Not really. I went twice in a week to draw blood. I think I passed that fear. It's not the needles that scare me. It was the risk of not being able to change. Being delayed again. Maybe he would tell me that I need to lower my glucose level for a few months before starting.

I thought about a hundred things in the couple of minutes I drove. I parked a couple of spaces ahead of the lab. I wasn't dressed femininely but I wasn't in guy's clothes either. There were more people than yesterday afternoon, but there were fewer workers. There was no guard in the door and just a woman behind the counters. She was attending somebody and I hesitated at the door. She looked at me and said "I'll be with you (masculine) in a moment".

It was a cold slap, not hurting, just, alarming. I sat and waited.

I gave her my card and receipt. I went back to my seat. She just printed the results. I was nervous still but it was a weird kind of anxiety.

She came to me, didn't call me. The receipt and card were behind the envelope. There were no exchange of words. It was like a mutual secret. Like a guarding of a secret information. Is this it? Is my own identity a secret? Why didn't I go as a girl like yesterday? I keep blaming the beard but that's not really it. My body is masculine, my face and complexion are those of a man.

I started laser, I have written the date of the next appointment for a second session. I have to be patient. It will be a slow change. I know the shadow is darker, I know I won't note a lot of changes in the firsts sessions.

I am desperate for starting the hormonal treatment, the feminization of my body and appearance.

I am not diabetic. My glucose level is high still, yet the hemoglobin AC1 level was below the diagnostic range and even lower than the risk factor.

I am ok, I guess. I'll keep watching what I eat and drinking mostly water. What will he say, though?

He told me to send him a text when I got the results to ask him if he saw them. If he did or not, he would look at them and then set an appointment with me monday or tuesday. And so I did. I sent the text before leaving for the United States. He answered back a couple of cars before the border. That was the last answer I got from him. I sent him a response telling him I would be in San Ysidro so I might lose the signal. When I returned I sent him the last one telling him I was back and if he could not get the lab results I would send them to him by mail.

I fear being too pushy. But, honestly, I am scared. I am nervous. I talk about it lightly with my parents, and yeah, I remember a couple years ago when being diabetic would be hell to me. Now it's scary but not that much. I am more scared about being literally trapped in this appearance.

In the mail I got the package. I was expecting a box, but instead it was just a plastic envelope. I finally have the bag. I can stop using the one from high school. This is mine.

We went to Costco and Target. I ate a salad and chicken nuggets.

Catherine is in Mexicali.

"We went to the plaza today. I entered a store with my mom. When I exited my dad said he saw a really weird gay wearing woman's clothes. "well, a man completely going as a woman, but with a man's butt"

I felt this cold slap again. An electric pulse from the tip of my toes crawling all the way to my hands.

"He always makes comments like in a joke manner, the tone, without a hurting intention, like in a fun way to him. Today he was serious, like for himself"



### 2016-04-17

What was it that brought me down today?

I slept a couple of hours just now. My uncle and aunt came to my house with my cousins. There was an alarm in the morning, 6am, maybe. I returned to bed and continued my sleep after the bathroom trip and seeing that my father came with his coffee and there was no breakfast.

It was fine, I fried myself an egg and toasted and english muffin. I felt fine, there was no tiredness nor hopelessness. Yesterday I got no answer from the endocrinologist. I sent him three messages and got a response just from the first one. I am nervous about my results. What do they mean? They were urgent. He told me to do them just then. There was urgency in his voice. He gave me his cellphone. Why would he do that? He would tell me to see him monday or tuesday.

I sent him a text message in the morning and his answer was that he didn't had them yet.

Do I call him? Do I send him another one? Do I call his secretary? Why didn't he just tell me to set a meeting next week?

I feel the wait as crushingly and heavy as the three months I waited in the beginning. It's different, though. Then, I knew when they would end. Now there is nothing else, the next time I'll see him it's almost sure that I will get a prescription.

I don't have diabetes. My blood sugar is high but I'm not diabetic.

My beard looks the same, darker even. It's frustrating. What it if no change happened? Was the pain for naught? It's just been a week. Less than that. All the forums talk about shedding occurring in the first couple of weeks. They don't even mention the first session.

Why am I so desperate?

Next week I'll go to the university. I have to set the appointment with the dr. to check my papers. I will pick up the invitations to the ceremony to give me my Honor's mention. That worthless piece of paper that just gives me extra reasons to be pitied by not getting a job.

In a week the Game of Thrones show will start again. I might see Misfits with Catherine in her house, too.

Wednesday I'll talk with Rene. I can tell him about my next visit to the endo, I will tell him about the urgent texts and the shame of contacting in his personal phone.

Thursday I'll be having the first testing session with Hiram. That fourteen year old boy. I haven't looked for the tests I will apply to him.

I'll be getting paid. I have been looked for my services. I should talk with Catherine about going to the university tomorrow.

She at first told me how she thought I was exaggerating with the results of my first tests. "Being pre-diabetic". I am not fat. I am just overweight. I remember the reactions of my godmother and Jessica when we were in Las Vegas. 200 pounds was marked in the gigantic weight scale of the restaurant. I was the first person to weight themselves. "No, it has to be wrong, you don't weight that much".

I do. I did, I knew that.

So, me freaking out about being sick, about having a reason for being denied treatment, it was the nightmare I was so hoping to not meeting. Maybe she took it personal. She weights more than me. I am freaking out about this health condition, does it mean that I consider her extra un-healthy?

I am still tired. I want to return to bed and continue sleeping. I don't know what to do to make time crawl a little faster. But what will it do? I had my second appointment two days ago. I should had started the day before yesterday. I am on extra time. Because of my blood, because of those numbers. Is it the food I eat? Is it the drinks?

What can I do?

I didn't do today's exercises. What will happen if I skip a day, will I be able to do them tomorrow?

Catherine told me I could just wait until tomorrow for his call. It's the weekend. He doesn't care about his patients these couple of days.

After that, if I get nothing, I could call the receptionist and make another meeting. I won't be a first patient. I might get a closer one than the end of May.

But, but... I don't know.

"If you don't want to wait, you could just call him directly, by phone, by voice, then you would get your answer instantly."

And I feel I am free falling with nowhere to grasp myself.

### 2016-04-18

He is not ignoring me. He is not abandoning me as a patient. A couple of non responded messages don't mean I will never see him again.

What is it that scares me about talking to his secretary? I fear the appointment will be far away. The first time I called she asked me first if I was a first time patient before telling me the date.

After the first meeting, he told me to say to her to put me for Friday. He picked the day. I might just wait a couple of days more, it might be a week, it might be months.

Waiting for him to answer meant seeing him today or tomorrow. There is no chance still of me receiving a call from him to see him tomorrow. So it doesn't matter.

I want to stay in the present, for a moment I want to forget the past and ignore the future. Can I focus for once on how I am feeling just now?

This is life, not what I've lived nor what awaits for me. Just now. Here.

I feel sad and tired. It's barely 9 o'clock and my head hurts. I'm reclined in my chair. I keep a glass of water with me right now, it's the fifth of today.

I think of Catherine. She asks me if there is something she can do to make me feel better. And I honestly don't know.

What do I want? I want someone to come and hold me. I want her to tell me by the ear that I look fine. No.

I want to know that I will change soon enough. But that's not true either.

I think about hearing how I am who I am. People seeing me how I should be seen. How I want to look.

Today I shaved. No, I have my face clean shaven. My mother knows now the date of the ceremony of the university. Will she go with me?

I'm drifting to the future.

I have a credential with my name and an envelope with the last results of my blood tests. In there it says Sofia Fernandez and in Sex, Masculine is marked. That's who I am now.

Talking about the past is talking about the man I no longer am. Talking about the future is talking about the woman I not yet am.

Who am I?

The phlebotomist talked to me nicely and with kindness. She spoke to me as if I were not a freak. Or didn't she? She was comfortable and used feminine pronouns. She made conversation and heard my answers. Was her kindness pity? Did she want to be nice to the little freak everyone talked about last week. Maybe she felt bad about what somebody said: that young person with a female name.

I am thinking about the past again. And just now I might start writing about the wait for the next meeting or how tomorrow I will call to the receptionist and what I will say to her.

Why do I keep running away from the now? Does it scare me? Does it scare to know how I feel this moment? How I look?

The little hairs start shedding today. The first one came when I rubbed my upper lip before showering. Now my face is clean shaven, but there still are some dark spots. Will they fall? I can see the first changes.

And yet I am not happy for the couple that have fallen already. No, I am excited for the ones that will disappear.

So what? I might see the endocrinologist soon, and yeah, I'll go to the pharmacy and buy the pills and then take them. Another couple of pills that I'll swallow everyday routinely, a new daily habit that I'll cultivate. And what will I do then? Wait. Wait for more changes to come. Wait for my testosterone to drop, to the hairs to stop growing, wait for my face to change and my body, too.

Isn't waiting what I am doing just now?

This Thursday I will start with the application.

The glass is still almost full. The ice cubes have all faded away.

I put on a small t-shirt today, gray like the one I am wearing. It didn't fit. I'm bigger. I'm still broad. Today I did double the exercise. today's and yesterday's.

Why do I feel like I will let Rene down?

I wanted to tell him how I had started already. I haven't. I told him I felt better and more secure and confident. Now I feel worse than this whole month.

A whole day stands between now and then.

### 2016-04-19

I called again today. The clock in the phone said 8 in the morning when I was fully awake. I just awaited for the right time. Maybe somebody would be there. Maybe they would not open until later in the morning. I waited still.

A couple of minutes past 10 I dialed the number of the business card. I was nervous. What date would they give me? I heard talking about lasts of may. I rehearsed the words I would use the night before. And like a character I said my lines when a female voice answered the phone.

She asked for my name and phone number. She would give the endo my message and later would he return my call. I kept the phone in hand in case he would do it soon enough. By noon I was already thinking on a backup plan. At what time could I call him directly to his phone? 6pm. I could calculate that he would stop seeing patients in the afternoon. 6 would be late enough to assume he's free and yet sufficiently early to not worry about getting him busy in his personal life.

I was bad. I felt frustrated and down and ridden of every bit of energy and will.

Hilda was the one to send the first message. She shared with me the page of the newspaper where my name appeared in a list of the names of people awarded. Luz was in there, too. I asked her if she had gotten any news about our trip. No. She had lost all hope. Samantha said she went two months after her test. A lot more than that has past since ours.

I knew confidently that that wasn't exactly true. The ceremony of the exam of november was much more late than the midsummer one. I thought about looking for the one of last year, compare the dates. When I got in the page of the organization that makes the test, I realized that the date marked in the bottom hasn't occurred yet.

I sorted the names and there we were. Me, with the Fs, lower down was she and a little lower was Ana. The trip won't be in the capital as I had thunk. It will be actually in Jalisco, where I have gone before. Zapopan, the ends of May. Probably Catherine won't come with me this time. It's ok. Hilda talked a little about getting a bus and going somewhere near. We could pay just the return fare and visit somewhere near.

It's not the same planning it knowing Catherine won't be by my side. Knowing nobody there will actually know my name.

I made myself a sandwich of chicken salad and ate the first half watching television. The other half made me a little sick. I could think of nothing else besides the lack of answer by the doctor. Was he ignoring me? I had to talk about it, but with whom?

Tomorrow I will see Rene. I could tell him. It's just another day. Why did I want to take the hormones before seeing him again?

I sent Anahi a message. He might just be busy. He is an imminence in his field. The wait time between my call and my first appointment was of three months. Not even a week has passed. I had no reason to be scared.

I feared he would call me and tell me he could no longer treat me. Maybe he would just abandon me as a patient. I would have to start all over again. Just thinking, writing about it made the tears roll and jump from my cheeks to the pillow bellow me.

By four in the afternoon I was in the computer looking some tests to apply to my patient when I heard the ringtone. There was an unsaved number in the screen and the app marked Francisco Magallanes below. I answered in a high voice. The voice that received me was the one of the receptionist. It wasn't the same one that took my message. She was looking for Sofia. The doctor could see me tomorrow by 12:30, was it ok by me?

Yeah, of course. I could cancel my session with Rene. After seeing him I would no longer need it. I sent him a text message. I didn't want to dial another number. After sending the message the phone rang again. No, it would be thursday instead of tomorrow, yeah, the same time.

Rene answered me back. I apologized and told him that I could see him.

Yesterday my dad called home. Everyone who calls always asks who is the one speaking. Is it Luis? Miguel? Me? Yesterday my dad asked, too.

"Who is it, Laura?"



### 2016-04-20

Tomorrow I will go to the endocrinologist. He sent me for another blood test. The blood test marks everything normal. Rene asked me too about the results. He said those were fine. "Do you think he will start you tomorrow?" I don't know. I honestly don;t know.

I still feel a little guilty about my pressuring texts. He doesn't know how I was so desperate for his call. In his eyes I sent him only 4 text messages and a phone call to his office. The first one doesn't count because he asked for it. The second one was a response to his answer. The third one an offer. The fourth was monday, the first day of our potential meeting after a weekend of silence. The phone call was the last one. I called to his office and not his personal number, that should count for something. Will he be upset? He might be a little angry and maybe regretful of giving me his cellphone.

Today I had my therapy session. I put on a t-shirt and the jogger pants. I'm still wearing Mickey mouse on my torso.

In the morning I opened the cellphone and did the exercises of the daily app. I haven't printed the tests to apply tomorrow. I didn't confirm either. I guess Liliana had confirmed already or will tomorrow. My meeting with him won't be until the mid after-noon. I still feel the soreness of my abs.

Tomorrow I'll see him, he will see me and say something to me. Will he give me the prescription now? Today is April 20th, tomorrow will be exactly two weeks since I saw him for the first time. Will I go to the pharmacy tomorrow? Am I still scared of being excited? I can't think of a reason why would he deny me treatment. I explained to Rene how his sense of urgency felt to me related to the idea of starting me now. He even took sometime to explain to me the options of the anti-androgens.

Even now I still feel this need of avoiding the subject. I want to talk about something else. What else did I do today? What another thing could I write about? I have soon the ceremony in the university, I have to confirm to the EGEL site that I plan to go to Zapopan.

Am I nervous about tomorrow? The other thing tomorrow, the one with the patient. The thing I keep postponing. I will get paid, though. That is always good.

Today I visited Catherine after my therapy. I talked with Rene about yesterday, about this weekend. Why do I check and supervise my own feelings? I was relieved of having the appointment and a date unto which to place my waiting focus. And yet it was "bad", because I was desperate and hysterical and childish.

But I truly was scared and sad and upset.

I don't give myself permission to get excited and want it now. Because I'm scared of being denied. I'm scared of not getting it. And then what? What will happen when I finally get the prescription and start the treatment, then what? Will I give myself permission to be happy and enjoy it? Will expecting changes will magically mean that I won't get them? Should I stay stoically apathetic to the changes I will be experiencing?

Tomorrow I will be alone with the patient. Projective tests, Dass 21 and the self-perception one.

Everything is set. I should not be nervous. I am ready. I like this.

I talked with Catherine today about how she is not. She is having her existential crisis. She doesn't like her career. She doesn't see herself working with this, doing her job. I was scared again. I could see her doubts, her paralysis. What if she stays this way? What if she has to stay? Will I go anyway?

I am scared of living in Mexico alone. I am scared of looking for a place to live and out myself the firsts weeks because my id says a name and my face screams another. I am scared of doing the process of getting into the master and then having to explain "my situtation".

I want her to be with me, I want her to help me. I wan her company and support. I need her.

What if she needs something else? What if she can't? Will I be able to live my own life without her? Without anyone?

Will I be able to finally live?

### 2016-04-21

I feel my nails long and awkward. I have been having them likes this since a long time, more than I week. Why is it until now that they started to bother me?

I could feel the throbbing pain of my abs in the night. Every turn under mu sheets was a flinching prick inside my navel. This morning the app was merciful. A couple of squats, that was it. My legs are muscular, I've never had problems with them. My arms are not strong. I am a little bulk. I should be fat like Miguel, maybe it's my testosterone what makes it so easy for me to gain muscle. Testosterone can turn into estrogen. Is that why I look kinda feminine?

He didn't ask for the estrogen in the blood test. Today I saw him finally.

I woke up this morning with the meeting in mind. I even forgot about my patient. I was going to the hospital and return home. After a couple of hours I would be back out again. I worked. I gave him some tests, I have four tests to interpret now. Two of the easiest and two more qualitative.

Do I even have the manual for them?

I was not going to confirm. They would meet with Liliana before me, she would confirm the appointment. If they were to no show up, she would just tell me.

Why am I avoiding the most important part of today? It's what I've been thinking and feeling. It was a rollercoaster. I will remember this day. This one, today, is the first day of my life. I'm a "transsexual" person now, in the local definition of the word. I've started transition. I took the pills with Catherine. I was on her bed, she gave me the water.

As soon as I got up from bed, I picked the clothes I would wear. They had to be something feminine enough to be seen as a woman in the pharmacy, but masculine enough to be seen as a man by the patient in the afternoon.

It's been weeks since I've worn a shirt and an undershirt underneath. I picked the red one. A matching pair of underwear of the same color. I have only one pair of clean jeans. They are man's but skinny enough to be ambiguous. I grabbed the black bra. I took all of the garments but the shirt with me to the bathroom. I laid them over the toilet. When I opened the door of my parent's bedroom to grab the towel I saw my mother lying in bed using her ipad.

"You didn't go to school" I affirmed her waiting for an answer. Today was the preschool teacher's day. I returned downstairs for the shirt.

I showered and shaved and curled my hair with my fingers and softened my face with make up. I hid in my room although I had no reason to. My mother knows about me. Why did I avoid her?

She saw me anyway. A couple of minutes before I was supposed to leave she opened the door and told me she was leaving. Did she notice? Maybe.

I used the correct door now. The guard asked me to sign in his sheet. At first I was scared that I would be asked for an id. The lady that came behind me told the man how she was seeing the dr Magallanes on the 12:20. She had her appointment before mine. I entered first, though.

The receptionist welcomed me. She recognized me before I even said a word. "Take a seat, Sofi, the dr will see you in a minute".

He explained the results to me, talked a little about them, asked me about my daily routine and then just gave me my prescription. He prescribed me some pills of diverse types of estrogen, anticonceptive pills for the cyproterone and spironolactone. He knew my testosterone is on the roof. Even then the dosage is really low. I'll see him in 8 weeks. June 16th, noon.

I'll be two months on hormones by the time I'd see him again.

I know the cyproterone can worsen my depression. Was that the reason I started being anxious about the dosage? What if after two months nothing changed? What if the testosterone stay high and the estrogen just flows through my system? Will these two months be in vain?

No. I have started. They will do something.

Rest for 4 days a month. He's the expert, he's the endocrinologist who went to Harvard. I'm not even a med student.

I should trust him. Just trust him and wait.

Will I do the new Facebook page as I said?

### 2016-04-22

I woke up with the same 2 days old pain in the abs. It was early. I had put the alarm clock to wake me by 9 in the morning. I opened my eyes without its work. Today no sounds came from it. It was not needed. The exercise of today consisted in chest, push ups, three different kinds. Two circuits of three types of push ups, 7 each. 21 each circuit, 42 in total.

Damn...

I did the exercise first. I ate breakfast, I need it for this kind of pills. The dose is low enough, my body best absorb it as efficient as it can. I didn't fry an egg or something like that, those kinds of elaborate breakfasts I used to do. Even now, after returning from Catherine, the usual thing would be to see what they ate, look at the food and consider it. Of course I would not just eat, but sure I could try. There are two boxes of pizza. One slice would make no difference. How many calories would a single slice have? 200? 300? It's nothing. If I can eat one, I sure could eat two.

I ate a bowl of cereal. It wasn't the special k I bought. I grab half a bowl of the Honey Bunches of oats. The rest of the milk that was in the container. I put an episode of Orphan Black and saw it lying in the couch. Until then did I took my pills. Forty milligrams of fluoxetine, twenty five milligrams of spironolactone, a little over half a milligram of a composites of estrogen, and a pill of a combination of estrogen and cyproterone.

Catherine is right, I have started treatment. I feel like I'm cheating as I say that I've started. The dosage is even lower than the low ones I've seen on the internet. He said it himself: "we will have to really block your high levels of testosterone".

I am just starting, these are the first months. It's just a start. I just need to have the levels of a woman. That's hard to accomplish when even now I have twice or even three times as much the testosterone as a random guy.

Yesterday as I checked the order for the blood tests I could see the option to check the estrogen levels. I could just mark it. Maybe I could send him a text asking him if I can. I just want to know how I am. I know the dosage is really low and first we have to abolish the testosterone, but I am just curious. May I order it?

I remember the "low" doses some people start with, 50 milligrams of spironolactone, 1mg of estradiol. I am at half of those. Half a milligram, half the lowest dose of spironolactone. He gave me some cypro, too. But even that it's low. 2 milligrams. 20 is the given, sometimes 12, or 10. Just a fifth.

I am scared of checking my blood and seeing nothing changed. A high number of T and just an unknown value of E. Would these two months be for naught?

Is it normal that I am this anxious and worried?

I saw somebody who said he was with a similar dosage of mine for a month. Mine it's just double of that. Two months, after those if the levels are the same I can ask him, tell him that the dosage is low, maybe try something higher.

Is it stupid that at the same time that I'm doubting its effects, I'm wondering if these feelings are even caused by them?

I know the estrogen will make me moody. I will cry with more easiness, I might get irritated. The cypro has the secondary effect of causing depression, even more with people like me who have a history of it.

I should distract myself. I've started. Even if they work or not, I have started. At least I won't continue to get manlier. I can lose weight, I can take care of myself. Get my body used to the medication, get my mind ready to the idea.

I picked Catherine up at her house. We drove to the school. She got checked her papers, now we are even. Monday we might call the dr to make an appointment.

I picked up the pictures and the ring. The graduation is finally over. Melissa gave us her card. She has one patient, like me.

I might not be wasting that much time.

Just one day at a time. Thing about a thing at a time. It's 8 weeks until I can do something. I might just wait and enjoy this bursts of calmness that I sometimes get.

### 2016-04-23

Days keep passing by but nothing new has happened. I woke up today in the same bed with the same mood. If we had gone to the United States I might have bought the pill organizer. Will I keep forgetting to take the pills?

I just told Catherine, I feel moody and sad but I don't know why. Is it what I've been thinking about the dosage? Is it the secondary effects of the dropped Testosterone cause by the spironolactone? Maybe it's the emotional effects of the estrogen, or the depression induced by the cyproterone.

It could be millions of things. And yet it feels naive to think that the hormones are even doing something to me.

Am I subtracting importance and value to my accomplishments? When I was in high school or even younger, I would have been super excited about being awarded nationally. I will travel and receive a medal and shit. And now I see it as an inconvenience.

I couldn't find anything to do, I even played videogames with Luis. Super smash bros, Mario Kart. I sat with him in his room and played. Several times the idea of telling him crossed my mind. "Luis, I am transgender".

Just like that, no melodramatic explanations or circling around with questions. He knows what a trans person is. I could bet he even imagines it or wonders about me. I didn't.

My mother asked about my appointment with the dr. So the results were fine, she asked. Did he prescribed me something for the cholesterol?

She always picks the worst of times. Were we alone or just my parents I would had told her. "No, I'm fine about that, the result was normal. He prescribed me something, though. A medication to lower my testosterone. I have it pretty high. Even for male standards"

I could say something about the estrogen. No, just that. It's not that it's a secret. Why didn't I just say it then? It is a secret. I hid the information.

Why does it scare me to talk about it? I made the Facebook profile and yet I haven't put even the profile picture or the basic information.

Trying to distract myself I started interpreting the tests. Both the questionnaires are graded. I even decided to create some spreadsheet in excel. I looked for the NEO IP in the web. Or I could just use the 50 item open one form the International personality Item poll.

Do the rest of psychologists do things like this? Do they research about tests and psychometric qualities and statistical analysis? Do they even look for new tests besides the ones they're taught?

And yet they are offered jobs and promotions and opportunities.

I, on the other hand, am still unemployed. I haven't looked, though. It's been weeks since I've sent a Curriculum. I could even design a business card, just the name and telephone. Upgrade my own CV. Give it some color and formality. Quit the bullshit and write what I actually know and do, what differs me from the rest of graduates.

I am successful. I will be awarded the Scholar Merit by the end of this month. I will be given plane tickets and a hotel stay to receive a medal for having an almost perfect score in national test.

I know I can apply and have high probabilities to be accepted by a major university in a postgraduate program.

I can do lots of things. I have lots of merits. Will being trans make them useless? Will I be able to use this to gain pity points?

"I graduated best of my class, always an excellency in the academic world. After traveling to receive my award I'm still unemployed and homeless because of my gender identity."

What a stupid thought.

I have started hormones, in 8 weeks I will meet with the doctor and see my progress. Even if the testosterone is still in the same level I can argue for a different approach.

It's not like I'm wasting time. I am taking the medication. I am having the laser sessions. I can see some patches in the black forest that is my face. Today when Telcel called again to offer their services I was referred as Miss.

I can modulate my voice, I can be called by the feminine in the pharmacy when waiting to be attended. Sure, I'm still gendered masculine a whole bunch of times. But I am getting half the dosage other people start with, and yet, I keep forgetting that I have been gendered female even months before starting.



### 2016-04-24

I am tired, still. I woke up early today, too. Did I had an erection in the night? It's almost usual to feel a little turned on in the first hours of the day, hiding in that semiconscious state of the mind. Was I conscious enough to miss it?

The door of the backside of my room stays open so the morning light can wake me. Was it six or seven when I was fully awake? I slid my hand into my underwear, it was flaccid and sleep. Are the hormones making an effect or is it all in my head? I kept stroking it to see what would happen. Without intention my respiration started accelerating and my body tensing. I could to it later.

I put the green cover on the floor and looked for today's routine. It was just a warm up, so I finished it quickly. More than a week I've finished the daily exercise. Maybe this will end up being an unbroken habit.

I haven't shaved either. I've forgot when the last time was. Was it thursday that I met with the patient and the endocrinologist? Friday I went with Catherine to the university to get the pictures. Did I shave that day? Which would I prefer? This growth could be the one of three days or just two. As I rub my face I can continue seeing the black short dead hairs in my fingers. It's encouraging and rewarding. I can see, also, the blank patches of smooth skin that appear somewhere around my face.

Just 8 weeks and I'll know the effects of the hormones. Next session I will talk to him, ask him questions and tell him my worries.

Next Friday I'll receive the Honor's mention in my school. That little paper that says how I was the highest grade in my generation, just like the one Magallanes has on his wall.

Yesterday I told myself I would start designing the business cards I could use to gain clients.

Yesterday I finished the sheets for the tests, the projective ones are still undone. Nonetheless, I already found the english version of the BFNE, and have the items of the NEO IPIP. I have a test for the vocational orientation. And the ISRA I can apply it in the original spanish. The Beck inventory is the only one that's missing, but I know it will be the easiest to find.

This week... Tomorrow I'll see Game of Thrones with Catherine here. We will eat somewhere close. Wednesday I have my therapy and the patient. I haven't decided yet which of the tests will I give him. Tomorrow I have to call the dr to make an appointment for him to check my papers, finally. I will send a text to Liliana to confirm the change of session.

The business cards stay saved in the webpage. There are four designs in there. Two with the name of Ivan Fernandez, and two with Sofia Fernandez.

Both feel fake and artificial. Every phone call I get is a wrong one. Now it is amusing to answer the phone and be gendered feminine. Is it because they hear a woman's voice or an effeminate one?

Rene told me how he didn't recognize me that first time.

Friday I will have to dress formally and go to the ceremony. Will my dad go or will my mother? In there I won't know anybody but Luz or Paloma, whichever goes.

How many of us will be there? Will they give me something else besides the free postgraduate?

Everyone in Hiram's drawing is wearing a t-shirt but his father. His father's hands are hidden behind his back. His eyes are open and blank. His hair is shaded and his head covered in the drawn hoodie.

It's interesting and yet I don't care about it. I don't like grading these.

My facebook profile is still empty. There is not even a profile picture nor the basic information.

I hear Catherine's thoughts and feelings and they worry me. I doubt that she will accompany me to the capital. She is stuck in an arrested development. The idea of working her career doesn't do anything to her. She doesn't want to leave home. She is scared of telling her parents about her.

I can't blame her. I am scared of her telling them about me. Her father is nice to him. He is not aggressive or hateful to her gay friends.

But yet, I am neither her firend nor gay.

### 2016-04-25

And I saw her cry like I had years before in her own car after a chat. She turned and looked straight at me, an innocent smile, like a child who's confessing his crime. She's about the let it out, I can see it in her face. It's like containing all of it inside is tiring her. She explodes like a full dam, the whole river comes.

I picked her up after noon.

"When do you have your next appointment with the laser place?... It didn't work, it looks even darker than before." I haven't shaved, even today. Yesterday I was fine with it, I even let Catherine see it in person, see it and touch it. This morning it started to upset me. It's just another day. Tomorrow I'll take it off. It's almost a week of the hormones. The days keep passing by. The day after tomorrow I will see my patient. I will see Rene, too. That day will be a complete week. Just two more days. Thursday will be the start of the second and then, the next day, I will go to the first ceremony. Just one people of every generation of each career gets this award. From the faculty, just two of us will be from this semester, four from the whole year. It will be more exclusive than the one in Mexico.

Me and Luz. For the one in Jalisco, both Hilda and Ana will go, too. That's exactly a month after the first ceremony. A month in between. By then I might had finished the evaluation and their report. Will Liliana recommend me to other patients?

From there I will return the last day of May, half a month later, two weeks and I'll take the third blood test. I'll know if these two months were for naught.

I showered today before leaving. I put on the hipster t-shirt of glasses and a mustache. There are haris of the same length of my beard in my chest and stomach. I haven't shaved those neither. Do they bother me?

It's common this feeling of doubt after the calm. I experienced it, too, with the antidepressants. I feel better so I might not actually need this. I can't have it both ways. Either I doubt their effects or overvalue them.

From her house I picked her and returned to mine. We stopped in the oxxo of the neighborhood. She put credit to her phone and I bought beverages and snacks. Since yesterday I've been meaning to watch the first episode of Game of Thrones. We sat in the couch together and watched it. After the hour finished, I put Netflix for her, the next episode of Misfits.

We ate in the same burger place near home. Neither one of us ordered burgers. She asked for a sandwich and I for a burrito. We talked about Chevo and Jessica's relationship, about ours. I talked about what my mother told me her psychologist friend had told her. The antidepressants are dangerous, I should be careful, there are other ways.

I ate a weekend biscuit for breakfast with the pills. I did the daily exercise. Yeah, I ate almost a whole bag of chips, too, but after the meal I don't intend to eat anything today. This whole week I've been drinking water. Will I lose weight? Do I want to?

We kept talking about our future. Living together, moving to the capital. What will happen next year? We chatted about nicknames and memories of our high school days. Old remembrances of distant friends. Anecdotes of an almost forgotten past.

"Three years ago would I even imagine I'd be taking hormones?"

Two years ago I was in Spain and wanted exactly this. Me from two years ago would be proud of me and what I've done. Would a younger me recognize me?

Would I even recognize a me from two years in the future? Will I even be alive in three years?

Am I the same person who was alive before now? Was I even alive?

I dreamed with Monica again. There were no sex or kisses or nothing that I would be embarrassed to tell anyone. I can't remember exactly what happen. Was there pity or sadness? Were we talking? Why do I keep thinking of her? Yesterday Catherine brought her up. No, it was me. I think it's her whenever the notification of "morriquis" shows up in the phone. "I thought you were talking."

No. That was a month ago.

I have an app to take count of the days since I started hormones and since I last masturbated, but her? I guess now I really don't care.

### 2016-04-26

I woke up earlier than usual. It was near 4 in the morning when I stepped up from bed with a stomachache and full bladder. Yesterday I had set up the pillows in that comfortable and cozy way I discovered last year. This was supposed to be a recuperating and restful slumber. After the bathroom trip I returned and came back to my sleepy state. For a couple hours I rested.

Now I am with a cup of hot chocolate and an opened package of cookies. They're non-sugared. Almonds and cinnamon flavored. I could had told my father about this morning's call. I decided not to tell my mother, let it better be a surprise. Would she expect it? No. Why would she?

I woke again with that same ill feeling inside. Was it nausea? Maybe an ill-effect of the pills? I didn't feel the motivation to get up and do the exercise. Not even eat breakfast and take the pills. I postponed the first alarm from 8 to 9. The third one of 10 was the one who didn't play because of the income call. I was awake already. The app identified the number and marked the logo of the university, even then I answered with a female voice. No, a neutral one. They asked for Ivan Fernandez and I kept the call.

She was calling because of this friday's ceremony, I had received the e-mail, and maybe picked up the invitation. I answered before letting her finish. Yeah, I had already. She was calling, she continued, to see if I would be alright with representing the alumni. I would be their representative and stay in the podium and say a couple of words.

Honestly I didn't expect that. I had ceded my place as magna cum laude and speech giver. They preferred about voting and I was fine with it. I didn't want to be the one to stand in front of a generation of people from which I didn't belong and pretend to speak for them.

I told Catherine how I felt the need to try and make a speech of what I would had said. I didn't. Why bother.

And here she came. Offering me that again, except I wouldn't be speaking in the name of the psych class of 2016. The best of the class... No, I would be speaking as the best from the best of every career, not just Otay, not even just Tijuana, the whole state.

Every Magna Cum Laude from every career. I would be their representative. And I said no.

"No, I think it would be a better job for somebody else." She had offered that way out, but was still surprised. Was I serious? Was I nervous. I can't remember what she said. I just remember thinking about being introduced in front of everyone. Jose Ivan Fernandez Lozano. Male.

This time I would be in front, seated, exposed.

I reconsidered and accepted. I ought to have my speech ready for today. She would send it tomorrow to Mexicali so somebody could read it and accept it. Friday I will have to register at 10 in the morning.

The call ended and I had no more reason to return to bed. I had to initiate the speech, not just start it, but finish it.

What could I say? I wrote it and it's done, sent. They'll tell me later if something needs to be changed or taken away.

My mother will use the opportunity of the dinner to meet with Norma and Jessica. Her birthday will be the next day. Has she said anything to her mother about me? Today she asked me again what was it that the endocrinologist prescribed me. This time I did answered. She thought my doctor was a woman.

"He prescribed me something to lower down my testosterone levels."

"That's what makes you grow beard and all that"

"Yeah..." I confirmed her and told her how my levels were pretty high even for a male range.

Was it my imagination or was her face weird the rest of the day? Does she know everything is starting and I am changing? Does she note something? Of course not. I haven't shaved yet. Tomorrow I will. The hairs are long and uncomfortable. My chocolate is empty and I am left with just one cookie.

I still have to print the tests I will apply to my patient. Tomorrow I'll see Rene and him. I have therapy and tests.

I will be both a patient and a psychologist in the same day.

### 2016-04-27

I had a session today. I started to feel this strange thought of not having anything else to tell. What could I talk about? I had what happened with Catherine in her house the Thursday after I took the first pills. That talk about not wanting to leave home, not knowing what to do of her education.

I feel hunger. I ate breakfast in the morning after waking up. I decided not to do the exercises. It was hard to get up. I feel no energy. I know it's a secondary effect of blocking testosterone, a lowing of energy. I did it, though, a couple of hours ago after returning from the patient.

Liliana will leave in a trip to give a workshop in her alma mater. I told her how I would go, too, next month. The day after tomorrow I have the thing about the speech and the award. Later that night I will eat dinner with my family and my godmother.

I was a little child when I used to play with Jessica. We played a lot of things. Being a child I remember crying the first couple of times not wanting to leave. I wanted to stay with them, keep playing, doing fun stuff... It was such a new feeling having fun, having someone to talk too and play. I hid in Jessica's room and didn't want to leave.

I cried, too, when my uncle and aunts would leave home after a visit. What is it with me about being abandoned? Does it come from Edgar and my grandma leaving? Did they break me? Is that why it was so hard for me to let Monica go?

I went with Rene and talked about my dosage and treatment. Of course I'm just beginning. He's the specialist, the expert. I can order the tests. Ask for my blood type and my estrogen level.

My mother knows about my medication. Does my father? Do Luis and Miguel suspect anything?

I just finished grading Luis test. He's 12 years old, the standardization here in Latinoamerica doesn't cover his age. If I grade him with the one of a 13 year old boy, he would still be in the 90th percentile. Why don't I want to give him his score? He's above average. He knows that, I know that. He's way better and smarter than the kids his age. Why does it hurt me to accept it?

Is it because he would be like me? And if he's like me, he has a reason to ask me again to give him a test. And if he's like me, I have a reason to suspect he might have this feelings of dysphoria, too.

No... no.

He wants to be like me. He admires me, I'm his big sibling.

What will happen this week? I finished with the patient for now. Almost all the tests are done. I just have to arrange the Neo and apply him the Raven.

After that it's just the integration and the results.

Next month I will travel, before that I will have my next laser session.

Today I shaved. My face looks smoother than before, I didn't need any make up. Everyone sure saw me as a man, but I felt fine. After a week of having facial hair, this was nice.

Walking back to my car, a woman sitting in her van talking with another woman saw me and told me in a excited scream: "You have such pretty hair!"

I just smiled.

I made a stop in the pharmacy. I asked the man over the counter if they were still giving the cards of discount. He told me yes, I just needed and official ID and a picture. I gave him both and he went back.

After a couple of minutes I went around and found the pill organizers. There were several different kinds and I picked one big enough for all of my treatments. He gave me the plasticized card with my picture and my name: "do you prefer Jose or Ivan?".

"This card is for personal use only. It's a company property and if someone else uses we will confiscate it."

What will happen in a couple of weeks when I stepped in there again to buy my antiandrogens and hormones? What if I look feminine or just not masculine enough?

What if being a man they tell me that I can't buy the medicines of that prescription or ask me for whom they are.

"They're for me. I'm Sofia, but my legal name is Ivan."

It might hurt a little to say that, but it would be the truth.

### 2016-04-28

It's been a long time since I've lied down here in bed over my stomach with the laptop where my pillow should be. I am used to typing these words in the other keyboard, and using the television as a monitor. It's weird hearing the music from the laptop speakers instead of hearing the whispers of it through the headphones that compress my ears.

What could I write just now? Will this be another telling of my morning routine and daily activities? I haven't filled this day's daylio notes. That little and cute app that asks me the mood of the day and the activities I did. The summary of the 750 words I write here.

I picked Catherine up. I grabbed the hamburgers, the vegan ones, from the freezer. Another one of beef, too. Again we went to the university. This time I parked in the other parking lot, the one for students. Now the vast majority of the students in my faculty are ones who got in after I did. In the morning I called the doctor over the phone and asked for an appointment for him to check my papers. We waited for him outside his office. He was the same doctor that was giving class when Catherine was doing her social service helping the lady in charge of the promotion of the school lottery. He was telling the young students how the money of their selling was for sending us psych students to study abroad. "Are you going to study abroad?" He asked her. "Yeah". "Where are you going?" "Chile". "That's really far away. Why are you going over there? Don't you want some dark skinned boy like this one over here?" He pointed towards Manuel sitting in the front row. He was dying of embarrassment while Mario and his other friend where laughing their white coats off.

He did some jokes while we were there. Catherine was the first one. While he checked her documents I saw how her CURP copies where of the both sides. Mine I took them myself and just did the front. Would he deny them? Should I start all over again another day?

No, that didn't happen. He received my papers and copies and pictures and all was set. In a month I can go again and pick the no exigibility form. Almost a year later they would call me to pick up both my license and certificate.

It's finally done. I'm done being a student. I remember being a little kid thinking of this day so much. How many years are left for me to study? Then I can work and be independent, have my own house and pay for my own things. Live by my own rules.

And here I am, working with a single patient gaining 200 pesos. On the other hand I do live by my own rules. Who else can say that they are changing their own biology to be truly themselves?

Tomorrow is the first of the many bookmarks already set in my calendar. Tomorrow I will get up early in the morning, earlier than today, and do all the things that I didn't write this time. Then I will put some fancy clothes and print that cheesy speech and go register in the university. I will wait and wait and be nervous. I might be seated in the front, I might be seated with the rest of the students. I might not even be called.

After the ceremony and my mother's reaction and several congratulations in Facebook from people who don't really give a shit, I might see Monica.

Why did I write that? I was going to delete it and correct myself. But no... I won't see her, I don't want to see her.

I will see Catherine, just like I did today. We kissed and touched each other, we whispered our love to one another. I am happy.

I might see Catherine.

Later in the night my mother and father will take me to dinner, celebrate. Jessica and Norma will be with us. Will Martin be there, too? They have seen me with my hair. I actually traveled with them to Las Vegas. How long ago was that? A year? Two? No, two years ago I was in Spain.

How was my hair, how much different did I look? I was hesitating with the idea of telling my mom.

They will see me with a suit and maybe a tie. They will see the Ivan they've always known. My mother will be the only... no, both of my parents will now the secret under the man suit.

### 2016-04-29

It's done. I was in front, for the first time, standing in the podium with a theater full of people and students and family. I spoke the words I had prepared. The rector of the university applauded me standing. The Dr besides me smiled and said it was a nice speech. Several of the people with which I shook hands congratulate me back. One of them, maybe one of the postgraduate ones told me he like my speech, too.

I have the award and the medal. I can put now in my CV that I am Scholar Merit and that have Excellency of the EGEL. I don't even need to mention now the award I received from the university in Tecate. I could frame them and put them in my consultory.

Would I do that? Mark them with that name? I am still me. But would I let people now?

That was a little saddening thought.

Catherine did go to see me speak. Both my mother and father were there, too. One of the VIP told me how they make this kind of rotation of the places. Last year it was Mexicali, and before that Ensenada, and so, and so. They really picked me from all of the graduates. Me from Tijuana and the master from Ensenada. He graduated with a perfect 100 from his master.

What could had happen if it were somewhere else?

I liked that Catherine were there. From the university we went our way. I drove her to the Alitas. We ate chicken wings and french fries. She ordered for me a glass of beer with clam juice and sauces. Her drink was almost the same but with cucumber. For dessert we shared a bailey's mikshake.

Today was the same drink that we shared yesterday in her balcony.

I was nervous as hell in the morning and at noon when I was waiting outside. Would they separate me from the rest or give it to me later in the ceremony?

After eating I brought her home with me. I changed clothes. I can't stand the suit for a long time. I put some jeans and a shirt. I see the skin from my hands paler. I know it must be mostly in my head. It's been just a week. She grabbed my breast and told me how it felt fuller.

We shared dinner, my whole family, Catherine and Jessica and Norma. They know each other. Jessica asked her if she remembered her.

Tomorrow my family wants to go to the United States. I told my dad just a couple of minutes ago how I think I will pass. Instead I'll stay and grade the tests. I have to analyze the drawings. I have to actually transcript the NEO.

"80% from our graduates find a job in their field in a year... 50% in the first six months"

I will be one of the later statistics again.

Even I with a Scholar Merit and Excellency Medal and sitting in front of the whole theater full of honored students I don't one or even an offer.

I have a job. Kind of...

It doesn't matter. I have plans for the future, I will apply to the master and I will get in and finish it with honors, too. I will do lots of great things... surely?

If I get to live my life as me, happy with my reflection and the way the world sees me, even if I don't get a big important job or this fulfilling career I will be happy.

I wish Catherine were here by my side just now. I love having her beside me, her hands stroking my back and my face. Her fingers dancing gently over my skin. Like brushes painting this calming sunset or nibs dripping with ink writing the secrets of happiness on my cheeks and lips.

I love her.

We've been talking and planning with Anahi about going to the movies. The Captain America movie is out now. We will watch it someday of the next week, probably Wednesday. Next weekend we will go to the movies with Paola.

In two weeks I have the next laser session. Two weeks after that I'll go the Jalisco. A couple of weeks later I will have to test my blood again and see how much, if any, is my testosterone getting lower. A month after that will be the Pride parade.

Will Anahi come with us this year? I'd like that, although I don't mind sharing it again with just Catherine. Maybe now they might see us as the lesbian couple we really are.

### 2016-04-30

Another month now. 18 days until I finished the two hundredth consecutive day.

Today is the tenth day of hormones. Then again I keep thinking about the dosage and feel that time is being wasted. 7 weeks from now I can see my endo and tell him my worry. I've been reading about dosages, I know the medications and its effects. I know cyproterone is more potent than spironolactone but then again the dosage is a tenth of the prescribed one.

I see myself differently, but I think the change is in my own eyes.

I'm getting sick of receiving the notifications of yesterday's pictures. Over and over I see the number getting higher and higher with the names of the people congratulating me and reacting to the images of me in a suit handshaking with a lot of people and talking in a podium.

I saw some of the pictures and I could see the receding hairline of my right side. It's scary to think that I am growing older. Jessica today turns 23 years old. I've known her for almost 20 years now. We met before my brother was born. I was 4 years old? No, I don't think so, or was I?

I might be 5 or 6. Norma was my godmother in the graduation of kindergarten. 5, then. 18 years. We shared a classroom in jr high school and went to the same high school. One of her best friends, Andres, according to what my mother knows suffers from a similar fate of mine.

His was more notable. Everyone could sense it. It was obvious. Was everyone blind to my own signs or did I hid them thoroughly?

I did today's exercise later than usual but still early. It was back and arms. My legs are still sore. My parents and brothers went to the United States, yesterday I told my dad I preferred to stay here. I didn't feel like getting up early and besides I had to interpret the tests I have.

I asked them for a burger and a weight scale. I weighted myself. I'm 81 kilograms still, 179 pounds. It's the same than half a month ago.

There was a text I had read about losing water-based weight. How when you start lose that water pounds and then gain them back when the body readjusts itself. Nonetheless, there is a fat weight loss, but it goes unnoticeable because of its smallness in comparison to the other one.

Is that it? Or is it my fluctuating diet and diminished motor activity?

I can't remember the last time I wore feminine clothes. Yesterday I wore a suit and tie.

Next week I might go to the movies with Catherine and Anahi and Luis. I promised him. I want to go, and yet I'm scared that the plans won't come through. I get nervous about the clash of my two social globes, my two personas.

What if they mix my names? What if Luis asks something? Why haven't I told him yet? What am I really waiting for?

Jessica and Chevo sent me text messages today, both of them.

First it was Catherine who gave me Jessica's salutes. "Are you with Sofia? Sent her my regards"

It felt weird reading it from her words. I don't expect her to use the name, I feel it fake. It's a little unfair. When she gets it wrong, I don't hesitate to blame her and confirm my thoughts about her difficulty with the theme, and whenever she gets them right, I discard her effort and cover her good intentions in a blankness of deceit, of fake kindness.

Chevo congratulated me, too, for my award. Why do I perceive their kindness something not to be trusted? What is it about receiving what I want that makes me so uncomfortable?

Even the thought of hearing my own name in this house makes me nauseous. I can't even imagine how it would sound coming from my parents lips, the musicality of being called by their voices. Hearing them talk about me as a real person, an existing entity.

I am real. I exist. Then why do I hide myself?

Why am I scared of being shown and found?

Am I really a woman if I still don't look like one? Will I ever look the part?

Will they ever be able to see me like one? Do the people who call me by my name really know me by it?

Do I actually see me as myself?
