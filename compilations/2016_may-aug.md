### 2016-05-01

I've finished making the spreadsheet for the ISRA test. I love doing this kind of things. I should had studied Computer Science or Software Developing. I mean, I love that this calculations offer me the information I need to actually make a diagnosis of the psychological profile of a subject.

My dad brought breakfast today. I did the exercise in the morning, although it was just warm up. I showered. I weighted one or two pounds less than yesterday. I had just went to the bathroom and had finished the morning activities.

What else can I write about? Catherine went to the United States and bought us two t-shirts. Chevo and Jessica posted something in the conversation of the seven of us. They wanted to invite us to go tomorrow to the movies and see the new captain america film. Catherine answered them first. We already have plans with Anahi and my brother.

He was sitting here in my room with the lights out. I was lying in the couch watching tv and saw when he went out of sight and never appeared in the hole of the wall that shows the stairs. After a while I stood and check. He was in this chair watching something in his ipad. I freaked out. I know he was not snooping around or even seeing the computer, but I snapped. "What are you doing in my room?" I asked him firmly. He smiled thinking I was just joking around because of how I don't like him sitting in the chair. After noting my voice and my face, his smile faded and he just apologized and went upstairs. Did I do something wrong?

I sometimes go to his room but never when he's not there. I don't snoop in his stuff. I sometimes go when he's not there. I am an hypocrite. My secrets are not more important than his. I wasn't thinking about this. I was just angry of people being in here.

Tomorrow I'll go to Catherine's home, maybe we'll meet Anahi there. Catherine hasn't seen the last episode of How I Met your Mother. We made her promise us we would all see it together.

We can see the first episode of the other season of Misfits. There is now ready the last episode of Game of Thrones. We will see it together.

There are other things I could write about, but, I think I feel a little down.

Yesterday I researched a little about the dosage. I found the endocrine guidelines for treatment, now I have evidence that my doses are really low. It's just the first 8 weeks. I'm not even by a fourth of that timeframe. I could just be patient and wait.

I'd be lying if I said the changes don't scare me.

A part of me wants to experiment them now, see them, feel my body different and see how my face changes little by little, being unrecognized by the people who're supposed to know me. I want to see Chevo and Jessica and look at their faces when they see me differently.

Is that why their usage of my name makes me uncomfortable? Am I really expecting of never mentioning it to my parents until people can't really see me as a man anymore?

In a month, no, the last days of this one, I will go to Mexicali and travel to Jalisco. My parents might go, too. I don't have to say anything until then. I'll still be Ivan, their son, their honored graduate.

Hilda and Anna will see me as how I am. Just a couple more weeks of low doses of hormones and another sessions of laser. That will be the only differences between me as of right now and future me.

I could ask my mother for the money of therapy. I have to put gas tomorrow. I'll drive tomorrow and Wednesday. I should buy the pills. The antidepressants. I could wait to buy the "anti-baby" pills as Johanna called them. I won't get pregnant, and besides, The endocrinologist did recommend me to leave a four day window of rest.

I feel a tingling ache in my testicle. Is it the anti-androgens making its thing?

I finished with the ISRA test. A couple more questionnaires and I'm done. I have to transcript the NEO one. I could finish with the translation and do a google form. Would I need permission to actually make the standarization?

I could ask Chevo for help. I could do it all by myself. It's just a side work. I won't make any money. I could contact the spanish doctor and tell him my plan of adapting it to the Mexico population. I won't lose anything by asking.

I could keep procrastinating. That is always an option.

### 2016-05-02

Honestly, I don't feel like writing. It's been more than 180 continuing days that I've finished this thing of writing my thoughts unedited, just let out what I feel and think for a couple of minutes in semi-coherent sentences that I probably won't read again.

Why? Experts claim that an habit needs at least 21 days for it to be conformed. I haven't been doing exercise for more than 21 days. There was one day that I skipped. I still wrestle with the idea of just skipping it today, stay in bed, sleep a little more.

I can hear Luis talking about his results of the RAVEN test I gave him. Why does it bother me? Sure, he might be smarter than me when I was his age, so what? He might end up being smarter than me when he gets to my age. Miguel is studying an engineering major, he studied a technical speciality in high school, and yet he did exams, I skipped all of them. I graduated as the 12th of my generation.

From undergrad I finished as first of my generation. I have a medal for it and a diploma. I sat in the table of vip and shook hands with the other winners. I gave a speech. I will travel to another state to receive a medal for the score I had in my professional test.

Should I be proud? Do I feel threatened by the idea that Luis could be smarter than me?

The day after tomorrow I'll pick him up from school. We'll meet with Catherine in River Plaza and later with Anahi to watch the movie. I'll drive to his school after my session with Rene. My mother will give notice to his school that "his brother" will pick him up.

They don't know me anymore. His is not the same school that I attended to, not anymore.

There are a lot of movies that I haven't seen yet. There are a lot of books that I haven't read. I still haven't learned calculus or programming.

Did I give up? Will I give up the exercise, too?

I remember when I weighted myself almost every day. Is this nervousness about getting over the scale and seeing a bigger number than the one from the day before. I do my exercise, I try to control what I eat, but what if it isn't enough?

Today I showered and shaved. I shaved my whole body. There are red dots on my thighs that have not closed still. One on the left one stayed open and dripping until well after I had finished with my face. There lies a big red mark on the yellow towel which I used to dry myself with.

I ate breakfast, I scrambled two eggs with the sauce that my mother left from yesterday. With that and a glass of water I took my pills. Those pills. How ironic that a little more than nothing feels more useless than waiting to start. I am taking one pill each, a fourth, of what I should be taking is still more than nothing. Why does it feel so vain?

I started treatment, I am doing something. The lady from the gas station welcomed me as a woman. Why does it still feel fake and undeserving? Maybe I will always feel this way. Maybe I'll stay like this until I start seeing myself differently.

Yesterday I read some chapters of the book. I don't think I'll finish it soon, but I still read more than what I had the last month.

In 8 weeks I have the next appointment with the endocrinologist. I read how one patient started with 25 mg of spiro for a month. I'll just be 4 weeks longer. I have the paper, I have the evidence to ask for a higher dose. I don't even know the effects the medication has had on me.

In 8 weeks I'll have finished the program that my app gave me for losing weight. Will the dr weight me again, too? Will he check my body like that time? Will he ask about my breasts again? Are they even breasts?

In two weeks, no, less than that. In ten days I will have my next laser session. I hope it hurts. I hope it's more effective than last.

Should I tell the woman the medication I am taking? What if she says something or asks more questions?

My mother knows about them, but I don't know about my dad.

Should I tell Luis? It's idiotic to think about waiting until he asks.

Will I tell him?

### 2016-05-03

It was hard to get up form bed. Again I slipped my hand into my trousers, inside my pants and grabbed, touched, explored. I though I would have to reinitiate the counter on my app where I crudely tagged it "Days since I cum". The number is still the same.

I ate the biscuit breakfast and took the pills. Those little candies that its function is make me smile. Some kill my tears and fears, others destroy the manliness that poisons my body and the other one changes me from the inside. 5 little pills.

Thursday will be 12 of May, a little more than a week. That day I'll have the second session. I remember typing this exact words: "I hope it hurts".

That day Luis will have his recital or festival or something. My mother asked me if I wanted to come. Sure, I told her. That day will be Thursday. This week I'll have the penultimate session of testing with the patient. But even if for some reason I could finish this Thursday, the next one would be for results.

It's weird. I was afraid of being alone. Having no friends or supporting people. All of my group of friends know everything about me. Ok, maybe not the hormones, but everything else. The use the name and the pronouns. It's even with Catherine or where they're not actually required to.

Why do I keep wishing that they weren't here? Why do I still want to be alone? I don't want anybody to know I am trans. I don't want them to see me and see a quimera, nor a metamorphosis. I want to be me. I want to be seen as me.

But who really am I? Am I Ivan or Sofia? I don't want to be referred by the male name and forms. Why does it is still uncomfortable to give the Sofia's prescription? Or entering to the lab?

Why is it impossible to tell my parents about my name and persona?

Tomorrow I'll pick Luis from school. I'll walk to therapy as usual and pick him up from there. Everything else will be different. We'll drive to River plaza and meet with Catherine, maybe Anahi will meet us there, too.

What will happen in his school? My mother already gave notice that his big brother would pick him up. How will I dress?

I know exactly what I will wear. What I don't and can't know is how will I look.

Will I clear my face? Will I retouch it? Will there be somebody to recognize me? Will Luis say something?

Today was the burial of Eneyda, the medicine student who was missing and then found dead. I had known about her, seen the posts and news. I knew how she studied in the faculty. What I ignored was how she was Fernando's girlfriend. He's mourning. Anahi saw him in the funeral. She told us how she was expecting to see him crying, or devastated. He was just, there. missing, with the empty sight of a broken man. He was empty.

I can't even imagine how it would be the experience Catherine's lost.

I can write and wonder how it would be to be alone or isolated and forgotten. But even then, it's like I take Catherine as granted. Of course she would be by my side if I went to a hidden place of the world where nobody knows my story.

What if it were the other way around? What would be if everyone stayed but her?

If I had known about the app months ago, the first used I would had thunk about using it for would be counting the days since my last reaching out to Monica.

Lately, I really didn't know since when had I thunk about her or her face?

It came as a surprise when Catherine mentioned her. Yesterday instagram offered her one of her pictures and her accouns as being similar to her tastes. Today, the same photo appeared on her screen. She told me how she had seen this girl with Monica. At first I thought the coincidence was that the account that instagram offered her was of this woman with her picture with Monica.

The account was Monica. I didn't care. I didn't want to know. There was no surprise or interest. She kept on and I realized it was not apathy but worry what ill-ed me.

"Show me the picture' I thought of asking.

She kept talking about it and just send it anyway. She wanted to show the text that the app gave her. But I could see the silhouettes of the two women in dresses. A normal curvy body wrapped in a light striped gray dress, and a slimmer firm one with a black dress and the hint of red strappy shoes.

I recognized the body and hated it and missed it and envied it.

There was no face, just a body.

Later in the day I looked for the picture and met her face. Her smiling, mocking face.

Does she think of me, does she hate me?

Will I stop some day remembering her?

### 2016-05-04

I'm home. My phone was dead. As I grabbed it from my purse, I could see a red light flashing on the microphone. It vibrated a couple of times through the bag. Luis was seating by my right and Catherine by my left.

"Do I call her Sofia?" "No...?" "But, calling her Ivan will upset her"

I do hate being in this situation.

I woke up and drove to pick Luis up from school like three or for times before leaving my bed. Today I got up earlier than usual. Several times did I awoke and return to slumber before deciding to start the day. By 8 o clock I was already doing the morning exercises. Abs. Something about crossing the legs or hips and 40 seconds of planking. As I weighted myself I didn't realize I had actually gained a pound instead of losing it.

I shaved and put clothes on. I wore the shirt that Catherine bought for us. I decided to wear the long black sweater. I applied make up even though I would be picking Luis up. There was a kid there, reading a book, when I entered the office. Rosa welcomed me and congratulate me about my graduation and being now a psych licenciate. The boy asked me why was I picking Luis up if he leaves in the afternoon. He started chatting about the book he was reading. Frankenstein from Mary Shelly, I read that book when I was in fifth grade I guess. It was one of the first books in english that I read. I don't remember most of the story.

I picked Luis up and listened to him, what he had to say. He was confused why it was talking about Victor Frankenstein and he was telling the story but in the cover it said Mary Shelly. I explained to him how it was a story written by Mary and Victor was the protagonist. He seemed to understand my point a little.

I drove towards the plaza with Luis. I told Rene I would be taking him to the movies. We talked a little about last week. The card of the pharmacy and the problems I might face in the future. Eneyda, the student who was murdered. A med student from the faculty, the girlfriend of Fernando, Anahi's friend. It stuns you, when things happen closer than you might expect.

Catherine was with Andrea when we arrived. I introduced them as we walked. We went to the food garden, and after giving a round seeing the different locals, Luis and I decided to order two bowls of ramen. It was the newest place there and the first one we visited. "Welcome (girls)," the cashier received Catherine and me, with Luis behind me. Did he hear?

"What happens when you have both high levels of hormones in your body, male and female ones?"

I explained to him a little how testosterone is stronger and would overcome the estrogen. Does he know something? Is it because of me or him?

Should I let my pills out on the open for him to see? Should I just come to him and open up?

I reapplied my make up before picking him up.

And just like therapy, I don't know what else I can say. There were some messages planning a meeting, a going out with the gang. Paolas, chevica and us. I am a little excited about going, seeing them. How would they look at me? Could I go like me?

Catherine took the screenshot of the picture I sent her. I saw the video she took of me as I was eating soup. I could see me, my face, my eyes, my hair. I heard my voice. What is it? It's low, not really manly, but not feminine either. It is a male voice, unmistakeable. Can I change it, modulate it?

I wouldn't use female pronouns besides Luis, would I raise my voice?

I stood beside him with a bra and make up and a long sweater. Some feminine nouns slipped Catherine's mouth. I'm sure Luis heard them as he heard the ramen cashier.

Maybe this weekend we will go to Mexicali. I could go, I don't mind. When my mother asked us, I didn't tell her I had plans for this saturday. They asked about Sunday. We could go just that day.

I would not enter the pool. I would not take my shirt off.

Would I show them my pills? Would anyone ask? Would I answer?



### 2016-05-05

Another day of applying tests. I'm done with the tedious part of giving questionnaires and waiting. Next week I'll attend the session about the results.

Catherine talked with her mother. She was asked about me. They talked about Eneyda, the student that was killed. And so came the subject. The students of psychology are the ones who take psychotherapy, not the med ones.

"And talking about therapy... how is Ivan?"

And how am I indeed. I am fine, now. Catherine used the opportunity to bring her mother up to the latest news. Both of my parents know, I will "make the change", our relationship is serious, she is scared of what her dad could think or say, and that's the reason why she is not really able to visualize a future with me. Even if I change, she'll stay by my side.

I read the questions. I did not hear her voice or inflection or could see her eyes as she laid them in the air. Even then I felt, uh, rejection.

She doesn't really accept the relationship. Once again, people wish she could be with somebody else. Am I damaged goods?

She told me how she feels about her mother's illness. She's been sick lately, vomit and nausea and high blood pressure and how it is stress and stuff... Is it us? our relationship what's making her feel this way?

She wants grandchildren and talk about her daughter and her life and a big wedding... and with me, those things won't happen. I am the one who's taking that from her hands.

"She doesn't want them for me, she wants those for herself"

This day I finished the format of the questionnaire and I'm glad I did. I calculated a 45 minutes of answering each of them. He made the first one in 25 minutes. His score is lower than Luis. The second one he finished it before the hour came up. Liliana told me how she's thinking about sending me another evaluation.

And my mother now told me about the reaction of her friend, my godmother, Theresa. She saw the video of my speech, how I talked and congratulated them. She cried of the excitement.

Can I take those accomplishments as mine? Are they still my own if I go by another name or face?

How could I brag my diplomas and medals when they were awarded to another person? Will everyone still congratulate me when they won't recognize me anymore? Will they still remember about what I have accomplished when they don't care about me?

I weighted myself in the morning and returned to the number of two days ago. I fried the meat of one taco with two eggs. The plate lasted me almost half of a show. I used to finished it before the first commercial break would even start.

I waited until the afternoon before eating again. One burrito and the chicken Miguel left yesterday.

I dreamed something about someone taking out my clothes from the drying machine. It was loaded with my underwear and pajama bottoms. A couple of shorts and a couple of pants, besides that they were just colorful panties and three bras. Months ago I wouldn't even had let them in the machine. I remembered them before falling asleep, I just didn't care.

In my dream there was a conversation, doubt and shock. And I just didn't care. I heard it and I could explain it, and felt this feeling inside of me of being relieved. I rested with the comfort of a lightness.

I woke up and went to pick them up. They were in a cardboard box in front of the machine. The clothes were Miguel's. He was the one who took them out and laid them in there. He absolutely knows something by now. Does he care? Will he mention it?

Do I care?

I received a call today from the laser place. They will have this promotion, I assume for the mother's day, that they will offer every service by half of it's price. I could pay two sessions, just pay the one of next week and another one and receive four.

I have from tomorrow until Tuesday.

In the weekend we will go to Mexicali. Saturday I might see the gang. They talked about going somewhere fun and where they'd serve food, too. Someone proposed Pockets. I feel a little excited. What can I wear? How will I present myself?

Now that they know, there is this pressure of using it, not wasting their knowledge and acceptance. Like if I should force myself to show me.

Just like going to the endo, or taking my blood as Sofia.

Do they really see me like that?

Or are we all just kidding myself?

### 2016-05-06

I have already finished grading the Raven test. It was annoying looking again for a norm. It was the opposite this time. With Luis I wanted to give him a lower score so he wouldn't brag later of his abnormal intelligence. With my patient, even yesterday that I gave the test to him, I was surprised with the time he finished. He was done in less than a half an hour. Luis lasted almost the hour. The patient, even with two years more of age than Luis, got a score of 7 points below. His discordance points, both of them, were in the correct range. He barely got into the 50th percentile. He's barely average.

I have the raw score of the IPIP NEO 300. The complete 300 answers to the items are recorded in 10 sheets of paper. I could just transcript the numbers to the excel tables and get the raw scores of each facet and subscale.

But those numbers don't say much if I don't compare them with something else, with a sampling, with the rest of people. And like the rest of the tests I got into research mode and looked everywhere for a table of norms. There is none anywhere. Even the page where I looked for the Scales says how they don't recommend analyzing a single test. There should be a sample and an analysis of a group, with each member contrasted with the rest of that sample.

So, I'm screwed. I could trust the raw data of other researchers. I finally found the answers of more than 300 thousand people. The only problem is the data is raw. It's a piece of text with all the answers separated by spaces. How could I analyze that? It's moments like these that make me think that I haven't learned enough. That I don't know enough.

Yesterday my mother told me how her psych friend reassured her that she lasted two years to be accepted in a job because of the lack of experience. After hearing how the psychologists refers patients for me to be evaluated, she told her that that is awesome and enough. It's perfect for declaring experience.

Why don't I feel comforted, then?

Tomorrow I'll go out. I'll shave and change clothes. We will be meeting near the River zone an hour after noon.

Catherine told how she would be arriving later. Her mother finishes her english class by one and she has to do her cleaning and change of bandages.

Do I prefer leaving by myself and getting there on time? Or wait for Catherine and arrive with her?

It still makes me feel nervous exiting the house dressed in a feminine way. Walking alone and face strangers. Speak and be heard. The contrast of my voice and presentation.

Her mother has seen changes. Luis keeps asking about gender and transexual people and hormones. Miguel took my underwear out of the drying machine.

It's been two weeks of hormones. A low dose but two weeks.

This weekend I have to change money, buy dollars so I can go and pay the laser sessions. Next thursday I'll go for the second one.

In three weeks I have to be in Mexicali and ready to board a plane. Get my clothes to the cleaning place. Buy the medicine.

I can give a lot of use to the new app I downloaded that gives me points in an rpg way for the things that I have to do.

All the tests, all but one, are interpreted and ready. There is just the integration and redaction of the report. Liliana will give my phone number to the next patient to be evaluated, a teacher. Woman, adult.

I'm more comfortable with adult people. I don't feel like I have to take care of them. I don't feel like I have to hide information or juggle the confidentiality.

What I find I tell her. I'm paid by her. The results are to her.

Another person that will meet me as the Psychologist Ivan.

"The diploma will say Licensed Psychologist Jose Ivan Fernandez"

That's who I will be. Who I was supposed to be. How will I pick the diploma a year from now with my id? What will they tell me? It's still a year. I have lots of things to worry before that. 10 months. 8 months by a bigger dosage of hormones. Maybe I will still be able to look like Ivan. Even for a couple of minutes.

Do I hope for it or not?

### 2016-05-07

I haven't filled the agenda. It lies there, unopened with the answered tests of my patient over it. Today I left the house, I wore the same clothes I always use, but presented in a completely different way. I didn't wear a bright red lipstick or an intense eyeliner. I didn't wear a really feminine blouse or filled my bra with anything.

I just wore what I liked and touched up my face. My hair is mine, natural, nothing but conditioner and mousse on it. Cheap foundation and a mascara from target. That was it. That was all I wore.

My parents went to Costco in the morning after my dad left the bathroom and I got in. I didn't eat breakfast and took my pills anyway. In the morning I did the exercises, they were focused on the arms. Yesterday I didn't overeat. In Pockets I realized hoy it's more conscious now the intention of eating slower. It helps with the appetite and lower to food I intake.

I weighted myself after shitting in the bathroom from downstairs. I weight 175 pounds, one less than yesterday. 5 less than when I started weighting myself. There is progress. As I looked at myself in the mirror of the bathroom before entering the shower I realized how I am changing.

There was no conditioner bottle so I turned the water valves, wrapped myself in the towel and called my dad for another bottle. He gave it to me and I returned to what I was doing.

Catherine was waiting for her parents to arrive. Whenever they did, I could leave my house and go pick her up. Her mother would just clean her bandages and she'd be ready. We were the ones supposed to get there late, but were the first ones.

Paola was the next one to arrive. We chatted through the windows of the cars. Like 20 minutes later Chevo and Jessica came to the parking lot. They had to return home because they forgot something. After meeting, they'd go to a concert of Sin Bandera.

How did I look? That was in my head. The waiter kept calling Chevo "joven". Later he would give him the check. We played and took pictures. It was fun.

After playing pool while we waited for the food, we decided to go outside and wait in the patio.

Jessica invited us for her birthday to go somewhere and do something. Both Catherine and I thought about a night outside, a couple of bars, some drinks. It sounded nice. Then she completed herself. "Maybe breakfast? something nice"

She wanted to go to this place. "It was my idea", interrupted her Chevo jokingly.

"Princess tea party restaurant" I remember that place. Next saturday. I saw pictures of people in there. Pink wallpapers, everything fancy and nice. We would go there and eat breakfast. How would they see me? How would I look there? I remember seeing the pictures and hating the place. All the gender expectations and reinforcements.

I wouldn't be there as a man. Why am I still uncomfortable?

It will be two days after my laser session. The next day, friday, I won't be able to shave. The hairs are thicker and blacker. When I shave the next day, would they still be noticeable?

I am a little nervous, a little stressed.

After we all leave the place and said our good-byes, I invited Catherine to a cup of coffee. We drank tea in the Dinastia 12. It was nice. We were welcomed in the feminine way when we entered. As we sat, the waitress looked at us and asked us if we were ready in the feminine way, too.

It was a contrast of being in Pockets with people who know me. Waiters who don't and strangers who look at me with evaluating and suspecting eyes.

"La graduacion de ellos, invitarlos a mi casa, juntos"

All the plurals were in the masculine, neutral. The singular ones were omitted or avoided. A couple of times, one by Chevo and the last one, by Jessica when she told us to go pretties to the tea place.

There is the house of tea that I haven't took Catherine there yet.

Outside Catherine's house, we kept our conversations. We finished with how we would live together in the capital. Her mother asked her about me, our relationship. The wedding, would she confess? Am I one of her sins?

Are we ready to live together?

She's a little nervous and I am very excited.

### 2016-05-08

Two days before my father's birthday and mother's day.

I have placed almost all the pills for next week. Today I woke up before my father arrived from his morning trip.

I was younger. It was before highschool. How is it that I used to write this...

I am not her, I am not 22. I haven't entered high school yet. I am 15 years old. There is this girl I like, she's my closest friend but I have mixed feelings about her. There is a connection that's not really physical. I like being with her and close with her. I don't really feel the urge to hug her or feel her or kiss her. I haven't kissed anyone ever.

She asked me to be one of her "chambelanes". I've always hated this mexican tradition of the 15th brithday party of girls. It's not envy. They make me uncomfortable, it's facing the fact that they're different. She invited to be on hers and I feel special because of it. I am important enough to share this moment. I'm here in her gym for the essays of her dance. I've met her father. "don't you think it's normal that the man of the family has some time for himself?, doesn't your dad goes sometimes somewhere himself, like fishing or something"

Even those questions, it wasn't about me and yet it was so foreign.

Why am I writing about that moment? There are a lot other things I could be thinking about. Even then, the party, wearing the suit and getting uncomfortable, leaving early, taking it off. I played a character earlier that same day and I played another one, both with Zuri's friends, with my own, in the dance floor. I was extremely tired.

I did the exercise, weighted myself, took the pills and ate.

I watched the game of thrones episode without Catherine. There was the fight outside Tower of Joy. Rickon was given to Ramsey. Jon has left his watch.

Tomorrow I'll go pay the next sessions of laser and I'll buy both the cypro and the spiro, even though I won't take them until next week. How will the effects of its absence bother me? I've been complaining and whining about the low dose. If it's so low, not taking them wouldn't have to take a huge effect on me.

Tomorrow is 9. In three weeks exactly I'll be going to Mexicali, flying.

The first time I boarded a plane was before Miguel was born. My grandmother was sick and I traveled to Mexico City. I had faint memories about walking and climbing huge heads. I'm in this kind of park like disneyland but different. I pose in this huge board with ta cowboy riding a horse painted in the front, there is this hole on the wood where my face can appear over the cowboy's body. I ride this game where I drive an excavating machine. I'm fours year old, three maybe. How can I remember this? It was almost 20 years ago. Like another different life.

I was a boy then.

"Excuse me, are you a boy or a girl?" "... a boy" "see? I told you" Were they teasing me? How could they not know?

Then, a couple years later I would travel to Jalisco for vacations. I was in second grade. Miguel was just a baby, and I was a little kid. For years I would have this urges to fly again, somewhere, anywhere. I wanted to travel, go through the airport, board the plane, fly...

I am in the university, it's a little after my birthday and I'm doing all the paperwork to fulfill my dream. In my head I am battling my own war. I travel alone. Four flights. First to Jalisco, again, and then Monterrey. The same way back. After years I board four different airplanes in a weekend's length.

I would fear it was all for naught even until the day before I actually left. It was a transatlantic flight. I took an american airplane and went through an american airport all by myself. From California to London. Then Madrid.

I flight another time before returning. From Madrid to Brussels. A lot of bus and train travels I've done, too.

Even after traveling around Spain and meeting the world, I traveled again with Catherine to Jalisco one more time. One week there. Those were some of the happiest days I've ever had. I had the opportunity to compare traveling by myself with traveling along someone I love.

While I be alone in this month's travel, too?

Will I travel again next year to Mexico city again? Will I be alone or along my loved one?

### 2016-05-09

For the first time I'll write here in my phone. There has been more than a handful of times that I published my words from here. But it's always about an emergency, maybe I'm in mexicali,or I'm in Disneyland and there is no Internet. How did I do it when we went to Universal studios?

Those times I just copy and paste. This, now that there is no Internet home and won't be until tomorrow, is the first time that I've actually tried to write them in a different keyboard.

Today I went to pay for the laser session. The lady in the spa recognized me. Maybe I'm young, maybe she doesn't get much male clientele.

First I changed 600 pesos to dollars. I paid one hundred for four sessions. I'm set until September. Four months counting this one.

I went to the pharmacy and they welcomed me with a "young man" they said nothing about the discrepancy between the names in the prescriptions. I bought both the antidepressants, spironolactone and the antibaby pills.

From there I went to Catherine's.

We talked and watched the episode of game of thrones. Her mother made chicken in Chipotle sauce. I was supposed to like it. It should had been delicious, except it wasn't. There was a heavy taste of cream in it. I just ate the chicken and the rice.

What could I wear for Saturday's. Jessica's breakfast will be in a fancy and feminine restaurant. At first, I was apathetic to the idea. But now...

I don't really want to go with pants and shirt. I don't want to be there as a man. I am not one. On the other hand I can't be as feminine as them. I'd just feel as a caricature. Somebody hidden in a disguise.

I thought about asking her to borrow her some clothes. Maybe a blouse, something simple. I don't have shoes but our sizes are similar. Her feet are a little shorter than mine.

As we talked she told me something: you need to buy a lot more things to pass as a girl.

It broke me. I just paid more than 2 thousand pesos, today in matters related to passing. These months the medication is just a formality, they're doing nothing yet. The first laser session was a beggining. I'm thousand more behind seeing real results. And the, I need to pay more.

She didn't realize then the effect those words had on me. She sent a message to the group asking for how they would dress. Was it formal? Was it like those places were they don't allow you to enter with the wrong kind of shoes?

I read their answers and felt worse. Going pretty, like princesses. Paola send pictures of women dressed in different outfits.

I read them and felt foreign. There was no envy or longing. I just, didn't sympathize. Am I different?

I'm not like them, I'm not like Chevo either. Who, what am I?

I felt this sickening feeling in my gut. I wanted to go home, hide in my sheets and just cry.

I felt sad, so sad it hurt. I wanted to swallow it and keep it then until tonight. Catherine saw me and asked me if I was fine. I tried to lie but couldn't. My eyes betrayed me. I just let it out and hugged her. I cried in her shoulder and she held me.

It came to me as a surprise. Am I this emotional now? Are this because of the hormones? How many days have I taken them?

I'm a couple of days before beginning the rest. Four days of not taking them.

Eighteen days. A little short of three weeks. Do I have changes yet? I thought about restarting the streak when I would begin. I could use this words as a daily log of changes and new feelings. It could be a place to see the discoveries of my new body, my new self.

I didn't. I just kept on.

I like it better this way. I don't want to be defined by them. I don't want to just think about them and counting one and every day. When I wanted to know how many days have passed and I couldn't I felt relieved.

What can I do? I came to the conclusion of not going. Teling Jessica that it was too much for me. Being in a place where there would be such a focus on feminity would made me feel dysphoric. Like I don't belong. I would not feel like a man nor a woman. I would be sad and distracted and as much as I want to share the moment with you, being there, besides not really being able to accompany you, I would make things worse for everybody.

But is that what I really want? Just avoiding it and not going because I'm not woman enough?



### 2016-05-10

 I might have to cheat again. I'm on my mother's phone. I dont think I have the time to type the seven hundred words now, in here.

There is still no internet. Today we went to fridays to celebrate my fathers birthday and mothers day. My mom stayed home all day. I tried to do the report but I still havent started it. I finished with the family test. I just have one more day to finish it.

Tomorrow ill go to therapy. In the evening ill see catherine after my session. I still feel sad. Its not just the saturdays breakfast place. Its not just that i have nothing to wear. Its the feeling of being an impostor, being fake, a failure.

My mother went to pick my grandma from the bus central before picking Luis up from school. Will she see me tomorrow when ill leave?

Jessica sent a message saying that shell change the place for the weekend. There was a problem today with the reservation. My problem is supposed to be solved. And yet i still feel like shit. Evertything has changed and et nothing has.

I cant keep typing on this fucking phone. I really tried. Its useless.

Fuck this. Fuck this. Fuck this...
Even cheating in this ducking phone is pissing me off.
Fucking autocorrector doesnt change i, but it does change fucking.
Fuck this.


### 2016-05-11

So close, so fucking close.

Today, after three days I got the internet back. Yesterday I really tried to finish the words from my mother's phone, I kept writing even though I was irritated and sad and wanted to do nothing. It was all for naught. one hundred and more than ninety days all gone to shit. It was the longest streak I've ever had and more than I could ever imagine.

"Do you want me to help you cheat?" she asked me. If I had told her yes. If only I could had answered her yes.

It's over. It's fine. This will be a new beginning. I have 21 days of hormones, three weeks and I'll start from zer0 here again. I'll be a shitty egg until 100 days from now that I get back the phoenix medal.

Three weeks. How many weeks until I get to female range hormone levels? Will I start over again from there?

My breasts are bigger. It might be the hormones or it might be the exercise. But I can see a difference. I dreamed something about clothes. I had thunk about wearing the black skirt with the white blouse. I've never worn the red tights I bought before the night of the movies. Today we could give a round to the shoe places in the Plaza. Maybe I could find a pair of flats there. I decided not to go.

My grandmother came yesterday, my mom picked her up from the bus station. She slept here with Luis and was up in the morning talking with my mom before she left for school. I was awake listening to their voices and screams. I wanted to go back to sleep, I was tired and angry.

I slept a couple hours more. I had time enough to shave and get ready. I decided to wear the jeans Catherine gave me and the red shirt with squares, it was a neutral attire. Nothing too masculine, but not too feminine either. I applied make up and mousse on my hair. I was ready to leave and pick Catherine up. My grandmother wasn't in the lower plant. She didn't see me.

"I can't see myself opening up to her. I was her first grandson"

I put gasoline and was dispatched by a man. He said hi normally, and then referred to me as boss. He saw me as a man. I thought that was how I looked. Sure, I could be a man another day.

I picked Catherine up from her house, her lips were a pinkly dark red. She was wearing a white t-shirt of wonderwoman. "Are you ok, you look serious?"

I was sad and down and blue.

"Ironically isn't it that you are like a princess?" said Rene after session. I am bothered by the idea of jessica's choice of restaurant, the femininity taken to the extreme. "A place for girls to feel like the princesses they are and their loved ones to treat them that way". Isn't that what I secretly want? For my family to accept it and see me and treat me as a woman?

Is not that why I can't even imagine it? Because if I think about it, I'll want it. If I know it's possible, I'll be devastated when it never comes true.

The internet finally came back and I lost my streak. I had asked her how I looked. Was it before or after the session? Kind of... in the middle, neither her nor there.

She told me how she relates me wearing shirts with being a man, maybe it's that association that makes her see me this way. Although, when I exited from Rene, I did look like a girl.

"Girls, I want to give you a good service but it was full downstairs and I'm alone"

We weren't sure if we heard her correctly. Did she call us girls? Did she see me as a woman?

Later she would say it again and we confirmed it. I did look feminine. We talked a lot about different things. I smoked like I hadn't in a long time. I'm supposed not to. I made the new timer in my phone.

I cried a little when we continued the conversation about birthdays outside her house. The time after our trips. December, January. She was supposed to get her distance from me. I invited her out. She took me out for my birthday.

"I get sad... I already was Sofi but I pretended to be Ivan, and I almost lost myself and I almost lost you"

The man who sold bread called me a girl, too, when I waited to be attended in the tire shop for the tire that wasn't really a flat.

Tomorrow I'll have my second laser session, and my second picking up of Luis and my second giving of results.

I, again, haven't finished the report for tomorrow.

### 2016-05-12

I'm a little tired. My face is neither swollen nor sore. I'm fine. I gave my second patient his results. I could see his reaction of how it was on -point. Even outside school after graduation, I feel lost without a guide. I can't give therapy.

Today I ate breakfast, I finished the chicken salad from Costco, first as a sandwich and then the rest with some crackers. That was my food of the day. That's what I ate before and after picking up Luis.

I want to go to bed and lie there. It looks so cozy and comfortable.

Luis would get out 30 minutes after noon. My appointment was at noon. I left home a quarter of an hour before. Maybe 20 minutes. I got there earlier and rang the bell. She welcomed me and I came in. She gave me the pages to sign and we came in. It hurt again, it was just like last time. The number was lower than before, does it mean that the settings were lower? It did hurt the same places. My lower neck was almost painless. Every prick or burn was both painful and exquisite. I could feel the effect. She told me how I would see patches of hairs not coming back, that would be the effects coming. I already saw some of that. I don't have to worry about beard shadow anymore.

Now the only thing bringing me back is my own voice. What's the point of looking like a woman if I can't speak?

I exited like five minutes after noon. It was the perfect time, I got to Luis' school just in time. The girl who was naming them on the mic didn't know me. She came closer to the car expecting a name. I gave it to her, full name. She didn't need it. Luis from 6th grade. That was all she said.

No, that wasn't.

"Luis of 6th, Sofia"

Those were her words.

"How would I be called if I were a girl?... How would you had named me?"

Catherine is right, I asked that same question. Except it wasn't. What changed? Why did it make me so uncomfortable? I was lying on the couch listening to the television when he opened his mouth. Was it the answers? Or their non caring? Is it that I'm scared Luis is exactly like me? So what if he is? What would it change? Why am I feeling like crying just now?

I know it's not my fault and it's not my parents.

I am trans. I wore a dress yesterday and took a picture to show it to Catherine. Miguel has a pillowcase filled with panties in his sock drawer. Luis told everyone how it would be cool if he were a girl.

I remember a chat Eric had with my grandma. He had some of his first seizures in this house. Even before that, he had some episodes, too. He got lost once when we were playing monopoly. He hid under the table. We could not find him. He stayed with my grandma and they were talking in the dinner room. Why did I listen? Why do I still remember?

"Remember how you told me you wanted to die, and you thought you would have been happier were you born a girl"

Did that conversation really happen?

Today is 12th of may. A little more than two weeks and I'll be boarding a plane again. Why ain't I excited? Was it the company that thrilled me? It's not the same if nobody who really knows me goes with me.

I was supposed to take Luis and my grandma to the university. Liliana sent me a text message a little after three. She had an urgent evaluation that she could give to me, I just needed to go earlier. It was impossible.

It was totally possible. I didn't even need to drive them. My mother got here just in time.

I could offer Hiram's parents my service as an academic supporter. Give him some assistance in his classes, tutorship. They could talk about it. I have a visa. Even I could just go there a couple days a week.

It sounded so... distant and scary. I couldn't. Not because I'm not able, or even because they would take my visa from me. I can't because I'll change. He will start the next grade after summer. I'll look totally different in August. Will I? Will I really?

Today was my first day without hormones. Three more days. Just three more.

I feel so tired.

### 2016-05-13

I feel down. There is this heavy sadness that surrounds me and embraces me. I feel so little and fragile and weak. Every single blow of wind can break me. This is the second day with just three pills. Can that be a real reason for this? Maybe this is all in my head, too. I told Catherine how I woke up really late and unrested. O feel drowsy and tired. Could I send the dr a message? He told me that I could and should text him with any symptom that presented as an effect of the medication.

Does this count?

It's a real low dose. I'm barely taking something away from my body.

I did just half of the exercise of today. It was supposed to be a morning routine and yet I skipped it completely when I got up. I ate breakfast. I didn't went to the bathroom nor weighted myself.

Catherine was. She went to the doctor in the morning. She is heavier than before.

My phone just moved with the muted dance of its vibrations of a new message. I know it's Catherine. The last message was almost an hour ago. We were talking about tomorrow, clothes. That could be another reason of my depressed mood.

I took the clothes out of the drying machine and laid it in my bed in the afternoon.

When was it that I watched the Sicario movie? Yesterday? the day before? I've put the Wolf of wallstreet like three time today. It's a movie that I've actually watched before, although incompletely. I watched it with Raul in our living room, in his laptop. His little netbook. Was it in spanish?

What can I wear tomorrow? My dad was in the kitchen as I was texting Catherine. Go to him or not? Asking him? I could tell him that I'll go out tomorrow and to move the cars. He'd ask me the time of my departure. That I don't know, not yet.

I decided against it. I want to go but not at the same time. What is it that I avoid? I told Catherine that I wanted to wear leggings but I don't have something to wear on top. My white blouse don't go with them as it is too short.

"Wear jeans". That's it, I don't want to. Why don't I? Because I wear them every fucking day. Those are my everyday clothes. I am seen as a man with them. They're woman's. I am not actually seen as a man with them. The last time I wore them, when I went out with her, everyone gendered me female. Even after I returned home when I went to the tire place.

She told me about her blouse. She feels uncomfortable lending it to me. She said something outside her house, everyone has seen it in her. It would be weird. It was so uncomfortable for me to ask her it was actually a little painful to hear her words after. Today she told me something else. Her mother doesn't like it. She feels guilty doing something behind her back. What if they take a picture and post in on Facebook and she sees it?

Why did that hurt even more?

I didn't even want it anymore. She could lend me her shoes, she told me to wear leggings and a sweater. But I don't want to wear that either. They're men's. My shoulders look wide. I look broad. They're male clothes. It's the same fucking thing. And again I'm nowhere. I don't have clothes. There's no point in buying if I can't really wear them.

They answered my mail from the university. The don't have the information of the plane ticket and hotel, but they will take me to Mexicali. Anna told me that she asked if we had to go formally, too. They told her no. Just take a black pair of formal trousers and they'd give us a shirt.

I don't have to wear a suit. I can buy a pair of trouser that actually fit. Be comfortable. Tomorrow I don't want to go shopping. I can't. Sunday. What difference does it make? It's not trousers that I need.

I saw the target page looking for female pants. It was a bad idea. There I remember the words I had told Catherine. Going to pride, she imagined us walking and me wearing a white dress. We could do it this year.

I can't buy them. I don't even have the money.

My body hasn't even started changing. I still have the dark, bold hairs of yesterday's laser session.

I'm worrying about what I will wear tomorrow and deep down I well know that they'll see me the same anyway.

### 2016-05-14

Today is Xennia's birthday. She was the first girl I liked. Will I remember Monica's birthday? I will remember Catherine's. Will she be the last whom I'll love?

I did go to the breakfast. It wasn't in the princess place that it was going to be. It was fine. No, it wasn't. Catherine was going to pick me up. Yesterday's night I didn't ask my dad to move the pick up and jetta because I wouldn't need to. The phone sounded by 7:30 to signal me time to get up. I showered and cleaned and shaved. Would it be enough time? It wasn't. There were still some shadow on my upper lip and chin, but still less than before. Even less than the time I was at pride.

Catherine is right, there is an obvious change between then and the next one.

Catherine's parents were in the United States. Her father would take her mom to english classes and then return home to clean Catherine and take her to the breakfast. He didn't. She told them she had to be there by 10. She did. It didn't matter. I ended up wearing the white blouse and long black sweater. Jeans and tennis. At the last minute I swapped them for the monk strap shoes. They are longer but still a little feminine.

I exited before they told us they were on their way. In the morning my grandma was with Luis downstairs. She woke my mom up. My father was down, too, by the time I had finished putting on make up.

I would have to go through all of them. I did. I asked him to move the cars. He asked me where I would be going and when would I return. He gave me some money. 100 more than he always gives me. Was that on purpose?

Did he notice? Paola noticed. By the time she saw me she said I looked pretty. Was he feeling guilty? no. Maybe he was worried.

I parked by the end of the neighborhood and tried to put lipstick. I didn't like how it looked. Neither the pencil nor the stick. I cleaned my mouth with the second to last make up wipe. Just a couple minutes ago I used the last one. 24 times I've gone out. Maybe more, maybe a little less.

Tomorrow is the last day of resting. I want them to end. I need to feel them in my body. I'm tired, exhausted and moody. I could had sent the endo a message, I decided not to.

I had a lost call from Jessica when I was near Lili's. I went to a pharmacy and put credit. They were already there. I arrived almost at the same time that Paola. She entered with me.

We had breakfast and conversations and laughed and clapped and ate cake.

Catherine kept waiting for her father. He arrived almost by 11. It was "her fault" she didn't told them it was important for her to be by 10. He went to the swap meet and lost the lapse of time.

We all met up in the plaza. The movie was irritating. "Oh, Chevo is out with only girls" Paola said to the other one. She didn't say it for me to hear. She didn't have to.

"I wanted to tell you, but I didn't want to make you blush with all of them. You looked very pretty today. I don't know if you were wearing mascara, but your eyes were so pretty."

My legs hurt. I am tired. I want to lie in bed and just rest. Tomorrow I'll go to the United States. I told Catherine I wanted to be brave and dare ask my parents for a pair of shoes. She was excited as if she believed me. I don't dare to. I don't think I will. Even when I started this paragraph I again thought about it and consider it. Both of my parents know. It's not anything to be ashamed. Why am I embarrassed? Is it about the money? No, I would ask him anyway to give me some dollars for when I'd go with Anahi. The money comes from the same place. It's them knowing, seeing. Asking?

"Do you want them? They're woman's"

Luis was the one who said those words with the converse. My father didn't look. Would they this time?

I have to buy pants. Formal pants. Three weeks or is it two?

Catherine told me she could go with me before then. Is that really true?

Am I ready?


### 2016-05-15

I have a headache and a dull pain in my abdomen. I was going to start hte words and yet Catherine just answered my telling her about what possible thing could happen my next endo session. "What are the Tanner stages?"

5 days now. Time really does fly.

I bought the slim pants I wanted. Super slim, 34x30, formal black trousers. I looked for shoes. I asked to go to Nordstrom Racks and then wandered a couple of times in the target in Westfield plaza. I saw the ballet flats. I looked them and considered actually tried them. There were people and I didn't shave.

A little boy looked at me and babbled with a smile. I waved at him and his mother just smiled.

In target something similar happened but the mother grasped him and brought him towards her.

I don't even pretend to consider that I was seen as feminine today.

I caught a couple of glances at me. I did look.

It doesn't matter. I shaved yesterday and irritated myself. Today I didn't. I could shave tomorrow. Until next thursday will be a week since the session. Then I'll give the second report to Hiram's parents. I told my parents' Lili's proposal of being his tutor, offering his parents my assistance as an academic tutor. I could get paid in dollars for going to his house and help him with his homework.

I was nervous, still am a little. Part of me wants to be denied, "thanks but no thanks". "We'll keep the offer in mind and we'll contact you".

The lights just went out and everything shut off.

I drank the iced coffee I ordered in Starbucks late in the evening. I used to brag how it didn't affect me. Of course it does. I might not be able to sleep tonight. Yesterday I couldn't. I finished the Wolf of Wallstreet movie and stayed in bed with aching legs and a throbbing headache.

The phone welcomed me to this new day with the notification that I had broken my all time record of walking. Yesterday I walked almost five miles. That's what I used to walk every other day when I tried to do exercise. A month ago I gave another chance to start that healthy habit. I didn't do today's exercise. The day hasn't ended although I doubt if I'll do today's.

 31 days. I stopped weighting myself, too. I broke the chain of days the moment I stopped doing the routine of waking up, doing them, weighting me and eating breakfast.

We lunched today in Denny's. I ordered from the healthy selection in the menu. A steak and smashed potatoes with squash. A cup of soup and unsweetened iced tea.

What's the point?

I wanted to see the picture of me in a dress. I know I look feminine, female enough. It doesn't look weird or grotesque. There is something that I don't like, though. My body is square and broad. My stomach is a big rectangle and my legs are narrower. I look like a barrel wrapped in a thin fabric.

It's my weight, not my masculinity. I look like a fat woman.

Sure, the only thing besides a body-image complex was another. As if my sex wasn't enough I have to deal with my weight, too...
It might be about the control thing. Or the lack of hormones? I knew that the lack of testosterone will make losing weight harder.

It doesn't matter. I should just continue with the exercise. Going out to walk, try to run. Do something here inside. Keep trying, not give up.

I have the pants and they'll give me a shirt.

They congratulate me in the ceremony. I went to the Scholar Merit award thingie. The people from the University, the dean, they all shook hands with me and smiled and said how was such an honor to be there. It has happened before. It has always happened, since I was in elementary school. Teachers congratulating me, principals. In jr high they didn't know me. Not personally. Although some teachers did. They called for me for a math contest or something, being in the subprincipal's office.

Being called after high school to pick up the ENLACE's scholarship. Driving with the vice-principal, being congratulated again.

It has always happened. It means nothing now. Has it ever meant something? Was it my depression? My name?

Was it me?

Maybe Rene has a point and I am a princess with everything under my touch and yet I own nothing.

I have everything I could desire, all the things in the world but what I really want.

I am the ugly princess.

The princess who was born a prince.

### 2016-05-16

It's been more than 30 days of doing exercise and today I've recovered the routine. I weighted myself with nervousness. I didn't know what to expect. Would a bigger number come? How much? What if now I'd be worse than when I started?

173.2 pounds. 78 kilograms. 3 less than when I started a month ago. One kilo a week is the recommended amount to loose.

That and restarting the hormones was a big pushup to my mood. I miss that peculiar flavor of the red pill. In the internet they described the estradiol pill as blue. I'm not taking that precisely. I am taking half a milligram of conjugated estrogen.

A couple of weeks and I can tell him how the rest period was tiring and upsetting. My dosage is low compared to the guide I've read.

Will he dismiss me? I can't know that. It all depends on the number of the T levels I get those couple of days before. A month exactly until I see him. It's not the middle of the wait time. It's not been 4 weeks.

In two weeks I'll go to Zapopan.

I received a call from Liliana today. She wanted to ask me if she could give my number to the other helper she has. Sure, of course. And then that got me thinking. I'd be helping her, giving her advice and lending my tests. She would get paid, not me. It's not that big of a problem. Except about last week. I gave the results in Liliana's time. And then continued explaining in my hour. She was paid 40 dollars for the hour of the results and I 400 pesos for the other hour. Except she kept the whole amount of dollars and half of mine.

Do I want them to accept the proposal? Should I start researching ways of teaching studying habits? The Syllabus of High School English class?

I am nervous except I don't really know why or about what.

She asked for Ivan, and called me a beautiful boy and if I were busy (masc). I just wrote what I thought in Catherine's conversation. Was it yesterday? No, Saturday. When we were talking in her car I mentioned how I feel pressure with Chevo and the gang. With the analysis lab. I have to go as a woman. Because they know about me, they're asked to call me in a certain way and I have to look the part, for my own good.

Telling Liliana about me is doing that. Just mentioning I've started treatment will bring my name to the conversation. Do I want to keep being called Ivan? Do I want to be referred as Sofia the therapist? What would happen with the patients that already know me?

And that's the thing, I don't know. I'm not ready. Emotionally, physically... I haven't changed enough.

Yesterday I looked for online pharmacies and noticed how for the same amount of flouxetine that I pay 200 pesos I would be paying less than half. 40 pesos a bottle of pills for a week.

In the United States they sell this bottles with hundred pills. It would last me months.

That got me thinking. I want to have money to pay for clothes and shoes. I want to buy those things, but I can't buy everything by myself. I'd prefer to buy clothes than pills. I can use the excuse of asking for the price in Costco. I could tell my mom, give her my prescription or going with her the next time she goes. Passing around the pharmacy and just ask. If it's cheaper I could ask her to buy it there. She would be paying. I could give her the other prescription, talk about that medication. Yes, I'm taking estrogen and t-blockers. Yeah, the name in the prescription is Sofia. That's my name. That's the name Catherine and my friends know me by. That's the one I'll ask to be placed in my corrected birth certificate.

Does she know I'm not really her son? Does my dad?

I know saturday he saw me as I left. We moved the cars and I could see his face as he got off his pick-up. Was he disappointed or upset?
My mom asked about the restaurant. She saw the picture. My aunt liked it.

Do I look the same? Did I look feminine?

I should use the new Facebook. Ask them to use that one.

I could wait those couple of weeks until the trip. Let her pride herself with the pictures of me getting that award and the congratulations to her son. That could be the last time I'd be named Ivan in a ceremony. The last I know of.



### 2016-05-17

Do the days go faster now that they are a really lower number?


Today it's going to be a week, seven days. Tomorrow I'll go to therapy and see Catherine. Yesterday I was at her house. Last night I ended the conversation abruptly. We were talking about today's plans and tomorrow's. This is the beginning of the Psych week in the faculty. The theme was about gender. Silly me, countless times I've been fooled to believe them when they talk about gender. I keep forgetting they mean woman.

The first conference, which I didn't even plan on attending, confirmed the way I feel about the "gender theory" apathy I feel.

She, a master at law, director of the Municipal Center of Women, Lawyer and defender of Human Rights, started her conference about Violence against women. Because Gendered Violence of course is against woman. Even her statistics that showed 7% of women suffer violence and 14% of men, was overlooked.

Familiar Violence, violence against any family member was explained as that against women. Domestic violence: the one women suffer at home.

I was irritated and annoyed. The Hall was full. People were standing. As it ended all took rise and started leaving. I wanted to see the one about the integration of LGBT people and the psychologist's work with them. Just me an a couple more people were interested. If it would had started when it should. Only 5 people would be listening.

Why did I shut off Catherine last night?

She told me her mother's reaction when she told her about the trip to the university. When she asked her for permission. "Uhm, why do you need to go again?" It was better if we just went to the more interesting ones. Maybe just pick one day. If I wanted to go out It would be better Wednesday.

I was angry. I told her. "I'm sick of your mom". "It's not just her... my father also says: "Are you going out again, didn't you just went that day?"" "Well, I'm sick of them both".

It's not the permission. It wasn't just that. I do resent them.

I have to go to her house and be with her, hidden in her room. Dress as Ivan and act the character. Be her boyfriend.

We were watching Game of Thrones and she came into the room when there was a scene with sex. "Don't watch that, kids". I cringed. We're not kids. We're 23, for fuck's sake. I don't want a teenage girlfriend.

It's not her fault. Why do I resent her, too?

I can't pressure her into telling them. Into their knowing. I don't want to be the ones to tell them about me. Why do I want her to tell them?

She was going to pick me up today. She would drive. I wouldn't need to pay anything. And we had to cancel. I went all by myself.

She sent me some messages telling me how she thought about going but didn't feel too well.

I argue with myself when I drove to school. I project my own frustration towards her. I see my own indecisiveness in her. I want the changes and I want to see myself different.

In the morning I received a voice message of Liliana, telling me that she would give the next patient, n3, my number. She would contact me later and we could set up a meeting. Yesterday she asked me if she could sent the girl my number, too, so I could assess her and help her on her own evaluation with the urgent patient of last week.

I am still a little nervous about this thursday. I had forgotten about thinking about the tutorship thingie.

"Would you let me paint your toenails?" I wanted her, too. Nobody would have to see. I could hide them in my socks. Look at them by myself.

Today, the psychologist that gave the presentation of sexual diversity had his nails colored in a pinkish bright red. They were short and clean. He wore an earring, but had short hair and some beard. He was slim but not effeminate. Was he gay? does it make a difference?

"And we don't even include them in the formulary questions, where we just ask about sex and put male and female... whenever that happens, which is horribly wrong I just mark female"

I sat by myself in the corner of the hall. At first, when I got in, I sat behind Suchilt. She didn't see me nor recognized me. I moved, before the beginning, to the corner. By the second one, I move closer.

I felt invisible and hidden. And at the same time, I felt a combination. Androgynous clothes in an androgynous body.

### 2016-05-18

Today I was going to go out with Catherine. We did.

What was it about yesterday? I opened up. I told her how I've been feeling at her house. Why I was upset with what happened the night before. The thing about her parents, about Liam. Being seen as a boy in her house. That's the thing, her mother doesn't even see me as a boy, she sees me as this other thing. Something in between, changing.

It doesn't matter, I told her and she understood. "You didn't say anything, it was all "it's ok, I get it"". "That's because it was the only thing to say. I had thunk about that. It wasn't that I was expecting it, but I knew it would happen sooner rather than later"

We were in Argana. She picked me up from my house. I did the exercise and showered. I shaved in the bathroom and changed downstairs. I applied my make up and combed my hair with my fingers. Catherine was updating me about her location in her drive home. I can't remember the last time she picked me up from home. I missed it.

I looked feminine, feminine enough. I was wearing leggings and the red sweater I wore on my birthday. I took the other sweater, the open necked one, with me. She would lend me a strap blouse to wear underneath.

We parked in the Sam's parking. I wanted to change but couldn't. We moved at first, and towards our second spot a mother and her child walked. They stayed taking the books out of the boy's backpack. I couldn't undress there so I waited.

"I'm hot", "you could change in Rene's bathroom", "No, it's ok", "Put it under the sweater", "I can't I'm wearing this one" "Why are you wearing that?!"

I was sad and upset. I told her to forget it, I could change later. "Can I tell you something and you don't get mad?" "No" I told her and stepped out of the car. I was scared. I knew I could get mad, I could get even sadder. I just wanted to get out. I could see the surprise and regret on her face.

We walked towards Rene's office. Nobody looked at us or saw us. We got in the Oxxo and I bought her a bottle of water. We waited outside of the office. He was with a patient. She's the friend of the girl that was before me a year ago. Does she recognize me? There is something in her face when she looks at me. Do I care? Does it matter?

I had my session and paid for it. The dollar keeps rising. I should buy the tickets for pride now that I can. I can pay them to my father in pesos and keep Cathy's 20 note.

After my therapy we returned to the parking lot and she drove us to the River Plaza. I took my sweater off and stayed in the tank I was wearing. I felt naked with my bare shoulders exposed. The bra straps were showing. My breasts are more noticeable. I thought it was my imagination but they are bigger, fuller.

I liked them and at the same time they scare me.

What if the changes surpasses me? What if I can't change as quick as my body?

I waited in the pharmacy for Catherine's card. She bought what she needed and then we went to the book fair. I felt weird. There was something there. It wasn't the people or even the sights. I was irritated and uncomfortable. I felt like that last time I had gone to an artesanal expo with Monica. I was tired and felt sick. I just wanted to leave. We had a fight because of it.

Catherine just asked me if everything was alright because she saw me uncomfortable. I told her the truth. "Do you want to leave?" "No, it's ok. Maybe, I don't know". We left.

She drove us to the beach. We were going to eat pizza. I was hungry and she ate breakfast even sooner than me.

We stayed outside the park and in the car. She offered me to walk in the harbor or going to Argana. We could eat there or the sushi place I had proposed. We decided for Argana.

We had a different waitress from the one last week. "Has someone taken your order, girls?, are you ready [feminine]?"

She brought us our food and kept referring us as woman.

I didn't change nor clean my face before entering home. My mother, father and grandma were sitting on the table as I entered.

"How good you are at telling your leaving". My grandma was looking for me at noon. She didn't know I had left.

Nobody mentioned my outfit nor face. Not even Luis when he entered my room before I even started changing.

Do they know? Are they blind? Am I invisible?

### 2016-05-19

"I miss you already. Where is it that you are going to the master?... Do you know about the one they're going to open here in Cetys?" "No, I prefer going to the capital. For me it is best going there."

I could had told her. That was the perfect opportunity.

I did today's exercise and weighted myself. Thighs, mostly. It was hard and tiring. I ate like 8 cookies. Tomorrow I'll probably weight more. I might see Catherine. She wanted to ask me something about the tests. I just want to be out. I can shave and wear something feminine. Somewhere were we will be welcomed and attended. I just want to be seen.

Yesterday I was filling the info for the new Facebook profile. I told Catherine how I started updating the video I had sent her before she had arrived for me. I stopped just before writing the description. People on Facebook follow me there. There is a lot of acquaintances who could had seen it. Is that what I want?

Once I thought and wondered and considered and even typed the draft in my phone about the text I could publish in my profile.

I asked Catherine about what she thought.

We were in her car, driving home. I remembered my fear of injections. It's so relieving to realize that I have lost that fear. I have overcome it. Will that happen when I finally get rejected and I won't die? How relieving would it finally be to get that bigger fear?

Doesn't that have something to do with this? Sure there would be people supporting me and sending me comments and whatever. But what if someone else says something different? What about the people who won't add me? Won't they be rejecting me? They sure would be ignoring me. It would be a confirmation of my feeling of being invisible and unnoticed.

Yeah, she was right when she said that.

But then again, even one people who would add me would mean a person who accepts me just as I am. No roles, no characters, no more pretending, just unconditional support.

Am I scared? Yeah.

It is what I have been thinking.

Luis doesn't know. I picked him up today. He knocked on my door after I had walked through the table full of adults. He asked me if I could pick him up and his eyes noticed my leggings and my shirt and my eyes and lips.

I left for him a quarter after noon. I read a couple of chapters as I waited. Rossy walked with a walkie talkie in his hand and looked at the cars. She recognized me and didn't have to ask about Luis. Again, as she passed my window, she called "Sofia".

I told my mom about Costco and the medicine. I could ask about the prices, about the quantities. She said tomorrow she could go. This Sunday Miguel will have the rehearsal of the elections.

I gave the last results. The whole family was sitting in the room. I was left alone. Lili had to leave. It was just me unsupervised. I was comfortable. I tumbled some times and my words came tangled up and repeating. It was fine. I was payed. Nothing was set on stone about the tutorship. His father asked me if I could give him some books or helping him being more social.

I'm relieved is over. Tomorrow Liliana will call the other patient and tell her I will call her.

Another one who will see me as Ivan.

She asked me about the phone. She called me as I was dressed as a girl, presenting as a girl, and called me a handsome boy. I should had told her. It was the perfect time. She asked me about the master, why do I want to go there. "I prefer going there, it's better for me"... because there I can change my name and papers. Because there is safer for people like me, you know, trans.

I was meaning to make a mention. Ask her for advice. I need to tell her that I've started.

"Liliana, you remember about my, you know, situation. Catherine has told you, I guess. You knew me as Ivan and Sofia. I am trans. You've seen me dressed as a boy and as a girl. With the patients I was nervous and scared. I didn't know how to act, how to present. With the first one I was Ivan.

And sure, it was my plan all along, keep being "Ivan" professionally until I can leave to the capital and fix the papers. But I'd be lying if I said it's not tiring and a little difficult to keep this persona and role.

And, besides that, there's something else. I don't know what to do. I have started treatment. Now I'm a month on hormones and had taken a couple of laser sessions. The medication is making its effect. I guess I am scared that the changes will be faster than my own preparation.

Even now, I can't even tell you this."

Just as I can't tell my brothers and I couldn't tell my parents.

### 2016-05-20

Yesterday I read a comic about a transgender woman. Today I finished it until the latest post. I finished another one of a chilean one. They keep mentioning Santiago, and how the gay marriage in that country was still illegal and how the treat of her german friend was Palta.

I liked the art. It was simple and yet stylish.

I changed the cover picture of the Facebook profile. I haven't added anyone, yet.

I was sitting in the restroom and my mind kept wandering.

Today Catherine picked me up. When did we plan the meeting? She would come after noon. My mother took my grandma to the bus station. She left me two burritos of egg and a cup of lentils. I ate breakfast an hour after waking up. I heard the conversation like most days I do. I couldn't come back to sleep.

I'm avoiding Catherine. She sent me a message to whatsapp and I saw the conversation and yet I haven't opened it. Why am I doing this? We have talked about going to the United States, she even offered going Monday. We talked about going to the swap meet. There is transportation on the weekends. There are cheap t-shirts and clothes.

In the afternoon Anahi started a conversation with me and we ended up in that theme. I could go with her. We will see each other Wednesday. Do I know what I will wear? Does she? We should go shopping. Tuesday in the afternoon.

I answered the texts.

"Can I tell Catherine? she might buy us food". Why is it awkward? When I told her, she answered back that maybe we should go just the two of us.

Why did it irritate me? I asked for a reason. She will come to my house to watch the episode of Game of Thrones. Then Tuesday going to the US and Wednesday to the movies. It's all about permissions again, her parents.

The thought of last week came back. "It's so fucking tiring to be in a relationship with a 15 year old".

Am I avoiding her because I don't want to hurt her or because I don't want to hurt myself?

I will end up going with Anahi alone. Will I buy anything? I can, want to, buy shoes. I want to buy clothes. I could look for a white dress. T-shirts or blouses. Pants I have a couple. Skirts? I would not wear them.

I should buy the least I can. My body, I hope, will be changing. I want to lose weight, lose width in some places and gain in other ones.

She put the image in Anahi's conversation. She laughed.

Today she came home and I received her with the jeggings and her black blouse she lend me. Over it I wore the long white shirt with black stripes, opened. I changed bras twice. First it was the black one. Then I put on the blue to see if it would make some cleavage. I came back to the black one.

We started kissing and laid in bed. We fucked like we hadn't in a long time. I touched her, she touched me. I narrated like she used to. "Do you like it how my fingers play with your clitoris? How yours are touching mine? I love how both our hands are in each other's vaginas."

We both nearly climaxed. She penetrated me. I returned to making her come. We stayed in bed naked under the sheet. We were laying there, in silence, when the keys open the locked door and the sound of steps moved us from bed. She covered herself in my sheets and I stood up to lock my door. It was Miguel. He opened the fridge and then went upstairs. We put on our clothes again and got ready for leaving.

She picked up some shoes for her mom. I accompanied her and watched the catalogue. We looked around Coppel and some other stores. She took me to Macroplaza to eat. Alitas. We were welcomed in the feminine way by both waiters. I couldn't hear the second time she addressed us after we ordered the drinks and she heard my voice.

I knew I looked fine. I knew I looked feminine. I had sent a snap to several people and Anahi answered back "pretty".

Why did the reflection in the windows and mirrors lied to me then?

I kept seeing the man I see yesterday in most of my pictures.

Will he ever disappear?

In the bathroom I remember the pictures, today's leggings. Did I took hormones when I went to the Universal Studios? Had I started yet?

Tomorrow it'll be exactly a month. 21st of April was the day I started. Would that be my second birthday? Am I one month old?

### 2016-05-21

I think I just said the wrong thing.

"How am I not getting exalted? I fucking hate your mom. Just now, look what happened. You were going out, you told her and she "just forgot", and you're going to work, goddamn it, something she doesn't.
"'Come pick me up and that's it', the fuck?, you don't ask her to pick you up and yet she bothers you everytime you go out. she didn't even ask 'can you come', no, 'come pick me up'.
"She's always out and you have to count the times you leave, don't be fucking kidding me."

"You are a 15 year old girl that "doesn't have to tell her, you have to ask for permission", but at the same time have the fucking responsibility of picking her up because she can't take a bloody cab

"Leave now so you're on time, she will surely reprimand you that how you dare be late and making her wait"

"The last one hurt me. Sometimes you can be very cruel".

She had a reason for not wanting to tell me about her mom. I do get mad. Why does it bother me so much? She's right now explaining herself. I might be right, but it hurts her. She doesn't express herself like I do. She doesn't know what to do, how to solve her situation.

I don't know what to do myself. I feel, too, how she's stuck. I am frustrated as well. I never told her about the thought I had when I cut the conversation. When was it and because what? Was it when I told her I was sick of her parents?

"I'm fucking tired of being in a relationship with a 15 year old."

Was that what hurt her? Was the age? I know feeling like a child is a sore spot to her right now. She feels she's in an arrested development. It hurts her not being able to grow, needing their help more than the last years. She was independent, lived by herself, needed nobody in another country. That's why it was so damaging coming back and being treated again as a child. Now, after surgery, needing care from their parents feels like confirming her helplessness. Like a kick being down.

"You didn't talk to me yesterday because of that?" "I don't remember if it was yesterday" Last night it was because of not being able to go to the United States. No, I told her I wouldn't touch the subject. It was before. It was when I told her I had enough of her parents. That thought is older than a night. Yesterday I felt bad because of the pictures, how I perceive myself.

It's almost 9 and she hasn't leaven.

Today I woke up early and we went to the United States. The business cards were already in the mail. The spit kit had arrived, too. We ate in the Jack in the box. I haven't done today's exercises. In target I looked around the shoes section. I passed by the woman's clothes. I didn't even wander through the man's area. I bought a mason jar for drinking water. Luis wanted pizza. From the Starbucks I ordered a coffee frappe. It was too sweet and a little disgusting.

The cable from my earphones keeps grazing my nipple through the t-shirt. It feels so sensitive. Today is a month since the start. May 21st. Less than four weeks I can talk to the endocrinologist. A little more than three I will get blood drawn again.

She hasn't answered. Maybe she left already. Part of me wants to be right, I want her mother to scold her for being late. "I told you to pick me up a quarter before 9". I would be correct, and she would be devastated. Being right would mean the worst for her. "I'm not telling it's not true". And then a confirmation of her being both a child and responsible for her mother.

I changed the picture from the Facebook profile. I added both her and Anahi. She was my first friend, just as in real life a couple of years ago. She was the first person to meet me. Anahi was the second.

"I love you" she sent me in a text. "I love you, too" I answered with an emoticon. "Precious". Did she see the notification? Did she see the profile?

"Adding me doesn't just mean my mother seeing. Everyone from college and high school might see it, too. Are you ok with that?"

I didn't know. I had thunk about it. I hesitated.

I guess I was alright. I hope I am.

### 2016-05-22

It hurts me to live a fragmented life.

The screen is blue with an F enclosed in the upper screen. Before, whenever I would sign out, this welcome screen would appear the next time I opened the application. It offers me to enter just selecting the picture of my face over "Ivan". The first couple of times I signed into the other application felt like the times I would go out with Catherine or wear the attire for a time in the hotel. An exit from daily life and signing into this different persona. I finished the profile yesterday and started adding people. All of my close circle of friends have me there. So it would fit this surreal excitement and feeling of accomplishment when the notification popped up offering me to get a one click sign in. The new picture and name in the welcome screen. It would be so convenient. The phone knows it's my profile. Mine. It's me.

I didn't expect the familiar pain of seeing both pictures and names. Two personas. I am two people. Different and separated. I am a broken entity. Some days I'm one and others the other. With some people I'm known as this and to others that. Even by the same person I can be called by two names in the same day.

"That you haven't done it, that you've not been able doesn't mean that you won't be able to, Sofi. See how far you've gone this year.
Every time you're closer to living a single life, yours, being whom you are"

"Did you know some people say there might had been a transexual general in the Mexican Revolution?"
Did you know I am one, too? Did you know one lives with you in this same house?
"What?"
He repeated himself.
"Where did you see that?"

I keep thinking he knows something, suspects something. What if he asks because of him?

Why does it keeps scaring me?

I won't hide my clothes nor my make up. Not anymore. "Are you wearing make up?" Yeah. "Are those woman's clothes?" Sure.

I keep practicing those words. Will I be able to pronounce them? Won't I be mute?

Tomorrow Catherine will see her patient again. She'll come after. We will see the Game of Thrones episode of today. I watched a movie. Amores perros. I posted it in my Facebook profile. Do I feel the need to use it like I felt with Twitter? I can't remember the last time I posted something there.

The day after tomorrow I will take Catherine to the United States. A couple of fights came because of that plan. She will go after all. I need her. I feel weak and needy, but I do. I could go by myself or even with Anahi. But I know it's not the same.

Will this be the first time that we'll go shopping, the three of us? The plan with Anahi was to buy something for the day after, our going to the movies with Paola. "A girls' movie time", she mentioned. It feels so gracious, like a favor done specially to me. I keep remembering how I told Rene. It's damn if they do, damn if they don't. I thought those comments would neglect me. And now that they're inclusive I don't believe me. I am the one who rejects herself.

I do get sadder. The rest period has ended so that is no longer an excused. I am on my 5th week of hormones. 32 days. by the 56th would be the 8th week and time to get reviewed. Monitored. My levels would be checked, he would ask me for effects, how I've been feeling. I keep downplaying my progression thinking of the low dose and how there has been no significative changes and my levels will be similar.

I prepared what I could show him and ask for a larger dose.

Time keep passing. In a week I'll be in another city, boarding a plane to another State. A day after I'll receive a medal and an award. A couple days after the next week I'll be again in the laser place, getting my facial hair zapped. A couple of days later, I'll be dressing femininely to get my blood drawn. A couple of days later, I'll be seeing him. He will be seeing me. Will he note changes? Will he tell me how he got me in a low dose on purpose to check for secondary effects or because he perceived that I have a natural high levels of estrogen? No.

I don't know. There is still time until then. There should be other things in my mind.

### 2016-05-23

I woke up like any other day. I don't remember dreams. Yesterday I narrated the last one just before sleeping. The lift nad running in a suit. As it climbed the floors it went narrower and narrower. Jessica was with me. I carried a luggage.

I did the exercise and weighted myself. The whole routine that I've been avoiding. I thought, was afraid of the number being so much higher. It stayed constant. Just like the one from three days ago. That number is not the lowest but is 7 pounds lower than a month ago. That's good.

I ate the tacos that my grandma made me. The biscuit is still in the fridge. She was preparing food. "Your mother said to ask you if you wanted me to cook the meat in the freezer. If you thought it was old, you could buy some and she'd paid for it when she arrives."

I didn't want to leave home. The plan was showering and putting pajamas. I would receive Catherine casually. Now I had to say no. I had to deny them going. I was in the bathroom when she came with the news. "No, cook the meat, it's alright, I don't want to leave."

I felt down. It's so much burdening to feel their needs. If I don't go, there won't be anything to eat. My grandma can't drive. Miguel is in school. Everyone is busy. I don't do nothing. A little favor is too much to ask me.

I don't know how to ask for meat. What should I ask for? "What do you want young man?" I will be told. It hurt even imagining it.

I don't want any. Cande put some soup and rice. I stayed in the couch. It might not be such a good idea for Catherine to come. Everything was ruined because some really stupid shit.

It just went off.

I entered the shower and cleaned myself. I put shampoo and conditioner. I used for the first time the cream I bought for styling my hair. I even shaved my legs in there. I opted for using the machine. Tomorrow I can go for a closer one. I drove to the meat place near home, besides the first oxxo. I entered the place where they sell tortillas and bought the chorizo. The Oxxo was closed and there were no chicken in the meat place. I drove to the other one near the Calimax. I bought the chicken there and the chipotle chilis.

It was before all of this when I was standing in my room doing something in the phone as it sounded and the logo of the UABC appeared in the screen. They had the information of the hotel and the flight. I should just take a black pair of formal trousers and they'd give me the shirt so all from the university will go matching.

That was the fist phone call. The second was the patient. At first I tried to answer the same way I did with the university except it didn't come thru. It was a missed call. I tried returning the call but it was misdial. I just decided to wait. Catherine was just leaving to meet her patient. She'd be here by 4 and a half. He was late but arrived just at the limit of time she decided to give him.

Cande kept asking me if I wasn't hungry. Was I going to wait for my mother to arrive?

By four someone called home. I picked up the phone and didn't recognized the number. I answered with an androgynous voice. Not too feminine but yet changed still. I found familiar the one from the auricular. "Who is this? " It was Miguel. He left his keys behind the television. I felt how my voice lowered as I recognized him. Did he notice?

He stayed in the table eating. My grandma made him some eggs and warmed a bowl of rice with beans.

Just minutes before Catherine's arrival they both went upstairs. We ate together in the table and shared my mason jar filled with tea. The phone rang for the third time. This time I could answer the patient. I set the meeting for 6 o'clock this thursday. It was all set. I will have another patient.

 After the meal I put on the episode. The sound of the keys in the door made me pause the show as my dad entered. I thought it was going to be Luis or my mom. They came later. A little after they entered, my grandma came down. They have met already.

Tomorrow I'll see her again. I could gather 75 dollars. That should be enough. Yeah. I could buy some things.

Why am I nervous? Nothing bad should happen. I will wear feminine clothes but not completely. They can't deny me entrance for looking "gay". It's not a disguise. I won't be having make up. Not much anyway.



### 2016-05-24

I'm home. I've taken my pills and refilled the organized with the missing ones that Catherine bought with her card.

According to the app in my phone today's walked steps are over 7 thousand. I don't know how many kilometers are that. I bought what I was supposed to buy. I wanted flat shoes and t-shirts and I even bought a blouse. I tried a dress.

It should be enough, why it doesn't feel that way? Even crossing the border as I was wearing nothing but foundation somebody offered something to us saying ladies. It wan't the only one. In Victoria's Secret the lady approached Catherine and me with the same opener. Ladies. There were one or other person who I know saw me in the same way.

I was nervous. There was almost no line. Catherine kissed me and left the mark of her kiss, like a signature on my cheek. I felt along the day this weird sensation in my anus. At first it was uncomfortableness. Now it's a really low pain. Last week was when Catherine came and we fucked in my bed. It's been days. It's not that, is it? No. It must be something else.

I sat in a bench after crossing the border. I was asked just where I was going, nothing else. Have a really great day, the officer wished me with kindness. Do people notice? He saw my picture and name. He saw me. I tied my hair and crossed the sweater over my chest. In the bench in the trolley station I opened my purse and asked Catherine if I finished my make up. One person saw me as a girl. It was confirmed, why did I still need it? I felt void and vulnerable. As if a part of my face were missing. I don't want the make up to look "pretty"
I want it, need it, to look normal.

She told me to wait until Anahi arrived. I could put it on in her car. I don't know how to do it when it's moving, I explained. We could stop and do it before stepping down to the mall. "Could you help me?" "No. Do it yourself."

She asked me if it hurt me. Why did I say no? It wasn't precisely hurt how I felt. I was upset and angry. It's not fair. I wish I could put it on in my house, too. I wish I could just wear it normally and everyday. It's not because I hide it from the people who live here. Would I had exited and let my grandmother see me?

I took a pair of jeans for when I return. They still are in the car. On the floor are the box of flats, too. Why won't I wear them tomorrow from here?

I ate two tacos and then a bowl from chipotle. That's all of the intake from today. I lost a fraction of a pound in the scale.

I went by myself to the dressing room. A blouse, a t-shirt and a dress. I tried everything on. They were L, and they fit. I looked fine. I really did. From the three items I tried, I only bought one. The other three t-shirts are of different colors. One is XL and the other two are L. The L ones don't fit me. They do, but they are too slim. I feel like a bloated piece of meat wearing them. I feel like my body is puffed up and muscular, like an adult wearing the clothes of their younger sibling.

I have shoes now.

What will I wear tomorrow? Both to therapy and to the movies. I do want to go, I do want to be seen and noticed.

Does that hurt me? That they are really no comments in this house? I am unnoticed.

I talk and am not heard. In the gas station the attendant put his ear in the window. He welcomed me in hte masculine form. And yet he didn't hear me.

When I try to change my voice it comes out as a whisper. A shy try of words.

The cashier in the payless shoes asked me if my hair was naturally curly. It looked pretty. Do I mind, even now I just recognize how they say my hair looks good. I don't look pretty with my curly hair, no, my hair on my head looks pretty. As if it were an extension separate of me.

Am I that? A separation? My hair is pretty, my chest is feminine, my crotch is masculine.

I am both Sofia and Ivan.

I am not a girl nor a boy, I'm a chimera.





### 2016-05-25

I cried a little on the way home. I almost cried in the start of my session.

I'm typing these words. I haven't talked with Catherine since we said our good-byes outside La Creperia. Paola didn't show up. Her parents had problems with their car and were waiting for a mechanic.

The untranslated items of the NEO300 are on top of my laptop. I try sharing my frustration and impotence with Rene about don't knowing how and when to come out as a female psychologist. He answered back saying how it was an opportunity. I had big chances with working from within the community. Is that really what I want? Catherine remembered me the comment I said. Do I really want to spend my whole life surrounded by people like me? Will I define myself because of my "situation"? People will go with me not because of my abilities or my personality, I will literally be defined by the state of my genitals. I would be the trans psychologist.

I am doing fine. Not really, I am getting 200 pesos each week. That's not enough to make a living. Yeah, I am just starting.

"You're doing well... you are doing nothing... you're not giving your card or your CV around" I was hurt by that. It hurts me that they say I don't do nothing. I tried, again and again. It wasn't just when I felt bad or that I gave my curriculum on purpose to places where they asked for female applicants. Maybe that was the last brick of the wall.

I wore the flats that I bought yesterday. I wore one of the blouses, a purple one, the t-shirt that was L instead of XL. On top I put the black sweatshirt I took from the laundry basket. It smelled good enough. I had make up already, black eyelashes and red lips, when I decided to tell DoÃƒÂ±a Cande I would be leaving. I said aloud but she didn't hear me. I climbed the stairs and again spoke. The same silence. I had to do it, I had to come in and show myself. Except I did not, really. The third time she heard and answered back.

My feet hurt from the walk. I was early. The tears almost made an appearance as I talked about the complications I have because of whom I am. It's tiring and frustrating and I wish I didn't have to go through this.

I met Catherine in the parking lot. Everyone of the three of us was driving their car. Did somebody gendered me correctly today? Rene told me "como ibas vestido?" "el unico trans". I kind of expect it from him. Liliana called me "mi niÃƒÂ±o hermoso". Anahi told us: "Ã‚Â¿dÃƒÂ³nde estÃƒÂ¡n estacionados? Los llevo". Catherine said: "nosotros". Paola told us she would not catch up with us because of her parents after saying "chicos!".

She said it herself, it would be a girls' evening. Even then, both Catherine and Anahi were upset and difficult. We ate in the DinastÃƒÂ­a 12. I ordered and iced coffee and Catherine a chai tea. After Anahi's arrival each one of us asked for a sandwich. We were leaving to GalerÃƒÂ­as, when I saw how they were stopped. I returned in reverse to where they were. Paola's last misgendering and yet they were indecisive about what to do.

Anahi didn't want to see the movie, she asked about going to argana. Catherine wanted to see the movie, she told me herself. Even then, they looked at me and didn't want to choose. I can't remember who was the one to make the call. I asked to follow her but she dismissed me. I left.

In Argana I realized they would ask our ids with Anahi. She looks youngish. What would happen? Catherine didn't want to choose a flavor. I said I wouldn't even be smoking. The were difficult again. Now there was no point in smoking just the two of them. Anahi wanted a crepe but here were expensive and the nutella was extra. What to do, stay or leave? Again nobody said anything. The waitress came and asked our order. I took the call this time. I was annoyed and angry.

In the ride home I thought about all of that, and the misgendering came up again.

And instead of anger I felt such sadness that I cried by myself.

I wore flats, woman's jeans, a blouse, everything but my sweatshirt was female. I wore make up, I looked "fine". What more do I need to do? What more do they expect? What am I lacking so I can stop being seen as a man?

I can't take this anymore. I am tired, sick of this. Can I correct them? Do I deserve it?

Have I done enough?

When will I accept myself?

### 2016-05-26

Look at me, come on. Come, enter, see me. I'm showing you, I'm exhibiting myself. I'm naked. Why don't you notice me?

I talked about yesterday with Catherine. I feel sad and down. I'm tired. Catherine and Anahi were right. I couldn't sleep in the night. "I'm sorry, your mom and I kept you up at night with our chat", yeah, they did. "At what time did you went upstairs?" "2 in the morning".

I had to get up from the bed in the late night or early morning to take a couple of pills for the pain. My feet were hurting and acting. A day in woman's shoes and I was miserable.

I sent the first message to Catherine since yesterday's good bye. "Are you angry?"

She stayed in Playas. I saw when Anahi's car left and I took a right turn in the park when she kept straight. Catherine's car didn't leave. She stayed there and started crying. She couldn't drive like that. She only remembered the phrase she told me, that I was doing nothing. That I keep doing nothing to change my job situation.

She explained how she felt upset since Paola's cancellation. I remember a week ago when they planned it. Seeing this movie. "Why this one? I really want to see this one", she told me. She wanted to see it just with me. I offered her to see it before everybody. Going just the two of us. We didn't have to tell anybody. She felt it was unfair. I spent through the same thing with the Captain America one and I didn't get to see it before.

So, yesterday, they planned it and one didn't want to go and the other one didn't even show up. She couldn't get mad with Anahi because of what was she going through so she got mad with me instead.

Until we left did she notice how she treated me the whole day.

Did I? Notice.

It wasn't that what made me cry on the way home. Nor today when we talked about.

I was telling her the impotence I get of kept being seen as a man. Sure, they can call me Sofia and say she or her. Yet I am betrayed by the plurals. "I don't know what goes through their heads that they mess up the plurals. I do. I know what to infer.

They might see me as female. Yet they don't see me as the same type of female. They accustomed themselves to call me as she. "Whenever I talk of him, remember to use she". I am the freak who changed sex. But I am not the same as Catherine. So, when they talked about the two of us. The use the neutral one. That's more unconscious. The reflex is gone. They see the multitude and if they talk about Catherine and Anahi, they are two women. If they talk about me and Catherine, we are a woman and something else. In spanish with a single element not being female, you use the neutral masculine form.

And so, they ask about us, or use we or the male adjectives.

I am betrayed by my own language. This analysis would be impossible were we speaking english. In english I wouldn't even notice until a third party was talking about me. I wouldn't have to think about myself. My language would be ungendered.

In spanish, now, here, I have to betray myself almost everytime I speak. Whenever I try to describe how I am, I ought to decide for a gender. Every time a stranger mets me, I get to see how they see me. Wether I am welcome in the feminine or they ask if Catherine and I are ready to order in the feminine way. There I could be sure they see us as equals. Listas, they said. The a assures me they see women, and since there are just two of us, the s confirms that they see me, too.

It's the people I know the ones that hurt me. It's not their fault. It's unconscious. Paola and Anahi are the two who've tried to support me the most, who would never do something to hurt me. It's me, it's how I look, how I present. How I let them know me.

It's the people closest to me the ones that make me feel worse.

I got 200 pesos from the interview today. I received 8 bills of 50, and left four in Lili's drawer. I used two of them to buy bread. I could had just bought one or two for me. And yet I bought for everyone.

I might not even eat any tonight.

### 2016-05-27

I almost forgot to take my pills. I remember how when I started with the antidepressants it was such impossible to even imagine the day I would forget to take them. Weeks later I would leave them here in a trip to Mexicali or remember to take them late at night.
This was the first time that I didn't take the hormones as soon as I finished breakfast.

Should I put an alarm in my phone? They could remember me to take them, make a habit out of it. Like the making of these words. Almost a year since I started.

I'm eating bread, the third of the kind I stopped to buy yesterday after my session. The second one today. My mason jar is filled with Colacao. I was woken up by the phone. It rang and nobody picked it up. I did. I answered with my normal voice. Edgar thought I was Miguel. He ask me to pass him "my nana". I just walked and brought her the phone. I came back to bed. It's her birthday. I was tired and stayed in bed until almost noon.

I don't have to interpret any tests yet. I haven't administered any.

I offered Catherine to go and see the movie we missed Wednesday. Just the two of us, like the original plan. I got up from bed and walked out of my room. I congratulated my grandma and went to warm the breakfast she had prepared. Today's exercise was push-ups so Idecided to skip it. Yeah, I'll gain weight. I don't care. I don't want to get my arms wider.

I ate and then stayed in the living room. I forgot.

I sent my mom a text asking her if we were going to do something for my grandma. She didn't answer until I sent her the second an hour later telling her I was going out. "Do we take her to eat?" I was angered and frustrated. What's the point in having people who loved me if I receive nothing in return? My parents don't know my name, or the process of my transition, my friends still see me as Ivan. I don't feel comfortable. And yet I am pressured. I give more than I receive.

I don't feel like that anymore. Typing it makes me look like a spoiled brat. They know, and try to understand. If they ignore something is because I don't tell them. Because I am scared.

I decided to go out with Catherine. She picked me up. I wore the jeggings and the other L blouse. Over it the denim shirt. I paintedm y face, even wore a little color on my lips. I didn't care about being seen. Both Luis and my grandma were in the livingroom. I just wanted to be seen as a woman. I'm so sick of being seen as him, as a boy.

I walked towards Catherine's car and saw her following my path with her phone. She was wearing a dress and a denim vest. Her eyes were covered in two black circles.

We tried to catch the show in the River plaza so there would be time left in the evening after the movie. We bought the tickets ten minutes after the starting hour. Even after the stairs and the walking to the theater and the masculine welcome of the guy who took our tickets, we sat in our seats before the actual movie started. I was quiet and sad. I was deflated and demotivated. I know it was probably a mistake, an automatic response. It felt awful, though. The familiar frustration and impotence of two days ago. What else do they need or want? What is it that I am lacking still?

After the movie Catherine drove us to the teriyaki place near the university. We sat inside and ate. Nobody gendered me anyway. We took pictures before our plates arrived. She told me how she liked the way I looked. I looked very feminine when she returned from ordering. My clothes, my face, my hair...

Why would people see me otherwise, then?

Even I, after returning home, after waiting in the couch and being seen by every member of my family. I entered my room and looked at me in the mirror. I was going to take the clothes off and put my pajamas on. But I caught that glimpse and I kept looking. I saw my face, my clothes, my body. I liked it. I didn't want her to go. I didn't want to take the clothes off, or clean the make up.

I don't want to see him in the mirror.

I don't care anymore. I want everybody to stop seeing me like that. I don't want myself to ever see me like that.

### 2016-05-28

I haven't filled the agenda since I can't remember when. This will be the last night until the trip. Tomorrow will be the last event I had anticipated.

I went to the United States. I woke up early. It was before 9 in the morning. My father was in the living room. Almost everyone was ready. We came back from the other side of the border before noon. Most of the times, by that time we're usually still on this side, before crossing.

I sent the saliva sample. That was the first place we went to. It wasn't the postal Annex place where Robin, the woman with yellow hair knows us. It was in that plaza, but a little beyond. The United States Postal Office. I had never entered before. It's gone, it's sent. It's just a little more wait until they receive the results and I have an answer back.

In target we were just the four of us. I didn't dare to wander off and look for clothes. I bought a pajama bottom of deadpool and three t shirts without any sleeves. Tank tops? They're man's, so they're not blouses. Will I wear them?

I haven't done the luggage. I always wait until the last moment. I remember when I was in elementary school, those later years and I used to fantasize about going on a trip. Preparing the bags and clothes, boarding the plane, visiting those new places. Would I even had imagined the trips I would make? The places I'd meet and the people I'd know.

In these last years I've traveled to Guadalajara, Monterrey, England, Spain, Belgique, Netherlands, Portugal. I traveled across Spain and then later I would travel with Catherine to Guadalajara again and within the state. Tomorrow I'll board another plane. It doesn't excite me anymore. It's a little annoying. I'll spent the morning with her. The rest of the day will be in a bus, in the airport and in a plane, surrounded by people who know me as this person I used to be. I'll be called Ivan and seen as a man.

I want to shave, I want to wear feminine clothes, I want to look as a woman, but I can't. I have to present my id and be recognized as I legally am. The day after tomorrow I will be dressed in a formal attire and be named in a ceremony along with hundreds of people to receive an award.

This is the last time, assured me Catherine yesterday. The graduation was supposed to be the last one. They keep coming and coming.

I have no way of winning. I don't want to look as a man, but I don't want to look as a woman either. I'll be with Catherine and going to eat breakfast. I'll be received in the school and escorted to the bus to be taken to the airport two hours away from here. I'll be seeing Anna and Hilda. I don't mind them knowing, seeing me.

Where will I sleep? How will the arrangements be?

Did I make a mistake accepting to go?

The screen of my phone is broken. I thought I had this song already.

"En que momento paso? Como fue? No quise alejarte.
La noche me sorprendiÃƒÂ³, te busquÃƒÂ©, ya era muy tarde."

Will I listen to music tomorrow? I don't think there is a point in taking the ipod with me. Most of the songs I listen now are in my spotify account.

Catherine posted a picture of 6 little test tubes made for drinking shots in the group of the gang. They started making plans about using them, going somewhere. The date proposed was June 11th. That would be a day after my third appointment with the laser place. I won't be able to shave the next day. I''l look like a man, again, in the beach, again.

It's so frustrating and irritating. I'm fucking tired of being in this situation. I wish, I so wish I could have the courage to tell the world, and feeling free, showing myself however I wanted to.

Now, telling people is not liberating. I don't feel free with them. I feel trapped in my own honesty. I have to look female now. I can't waste the opportunity, now. The changes keep happening and yet I am unsure if they really exist. I see the pictures and note differences.

Tomorrow I'll leave. I'll be back the day before my session with Rene.

I can talk about whatever happens with him. I hope I don't miss the words again.

### 2016-05-29

The day is here. I'm all bather and changed and ready. I hear the sounds of the fork and plate of Luis eating his breakfast. Was I rude when I denied my grandmother "even one little taco"? I feel in a bad mood.

I am wearing a combination of men's clothes and women's. My underwear and socks both are women. My t-shirt and shoes are male. My sweater is something androgynous. I couldn't not do it. I had to hid the microscopic black spots in my facial pores with make up. I even put the ring of the university. How do I look? It was too much manly. I couldn't bear it. I can't. How will I do it?

This is supposedly the real last time they will call my name and do something about school. Every one is harder than the last.

Catherine will leave home in about half an hour. She'll come pick me up and go to eat breakfast. The last two times out they called me by the male form. Today they have to. Whenever I get to school I have to introduce myself as Ivan. They have all our names counted up and organized. X number of boys and Y number of girls. What will Hilda and or Anna do when they see me? It would not be the first time somebody sees me like this.

Do I really care?

What will happen, though, when I board the airplane? They will ask an id to corroborate the boarding pass. I am Ivan, though. I should not be scared. I can use the male voice I have such distaste with, I can explain. Nothing have to happen.

A little more than 3 hours and I'll be leaving the city. 8 hours and I'll be boarding the plane.

Why am I scared and nervous? Why does everything have to be so fucking complicated?

I wish I could had just gone in male clothes and not shaved and presented as Ivan as I did those four years in school. Why am I not able anymore? Why does it have to hurt so much?

At least I won't have to worry about these words. I'll be having the tablet and my book to entertain myself. It will be a lot of waiting. Waiting for Catherine to arrive, then to the food to come, then to the bus to receive me, then to everyone else to board, then to arrive to Mexicali, then to the time of boarding the plane, then to getting to Guadalajara and then to getting into my room. The next day I'll wait to be named and for the thing to be finished.

I'll leave the agenda behind.

I've ben filling it with a couple of days of delay. Will it end up being like the black book of school? With months in blank?

Am I lazy? What is it that impedes me to transcript my life? I haven't still passed the journals from Spain. I have several unfinished notebooks started and discontinued. How do I keep writing here?

I've lost count of the days since the very beginning. Years since those days in highschool I used to write stories. Silly dream of becoming a writer. To me it was a possibility and yet today I laugh. Would I be laughing then If I knew that by my 23 years my dream would be one of becoming a woman? To me it is a possibility.

The counter keeps coming up and up and yet it doesn't reach it's goal. I feel like I'm juicing all that's left of my thoughts and nothing of value comes up. What is it that I am repressing? What dark thought keeps blocking what really bothers me?

I said that thing about foolish dreams. I talked about my fears and frustration of the difficulties I have of being one of "them trans"

It's not fair, it doesn't translate fairly to the english. He didn't mean it that way.

He's doing his best. He should be helping me, not the other way around? Why am I still so "confluente"?

Catherine hasn't answered my test. She was leaving the shower. Will she arrive before my parents leaving? Will I face them?

If I am not as afraid as I deny to be, why do I keep hiding in my room after changing?

Everybody here has seen me already in these pants. The shirt is man's. Why am I scared of being seen almost as much as staying invisible?

### 2016-05-30

I'm in the Telmex auditorium. I'm sitting here in the place where is stamped my name. I've been chatting with Catherine. Yesterday, since the University I've been talking and being with both Hilda and Anna. I was dressed pretty androgynously. I had the jeggings and a tank top with the white and gray sweater over. When Catherine picked me up and took me to breakfast, the waiter welcomed us as ladies.

Hilda was the second person to come. The coordinator that sent me the emails called me when we were parked outside the restaurant. She drove us to Mexicali with a man. I sat besides a lawyer. Hilda and Anna were seating behind me. I gave them two of my cards.

Hilda's mother reached her hand to met mine. She told her something about taking pictures. "You can take turns. You take pictures of, uh and, uh, to you..."

She hesitated with the pronouns. Will she ask her who and what I am, when we return?

I was afraid of whom would I share room with. How would they separate us? I didn't want to be with a man. I didn't want to be a nuisance to a woman. A man would feel weird with me, a woman would do so, too.

In the plane our seats were dispersed. I met my parents in the airport. I stayed with hilda and Anna. We looked for something no eat. Since breakfast we would not take a bite until reaching here. I ordered a chicken soup. They didn't wait for us. After we finally checked in our bags, we stood in line for security. They didn't say anything about the id or my appearance. As we entered the gate's waiting area, the coordinator of scholar services asked opus if we (feminine) were the last. One of them corrected her.

I'm still waiting. They told us that the breakfast would be served by 7 in the morning. The bus would leave at 8 o'clock.

They called the name of the first girl of the list, the one behind me, when they started assembling us for the rooms. They said her name and then one of another girl. I would be with a man. One of the two girls went to the desk and signed the little piece of paper. They said my name and another one with the same last name. "JosÃƒÂ© FernÃƒÂ¡ndez and Sixto FernÃƒÂ¡ndez". I went to the desk. The receptionist gave me the folio with our names written. The lady with the wood table kept repeating the name. Once, twice. I raised my hand and she called it again. "I'm here, I said".

The lunch box they gave us had a ham sandwich, a bag of chips, a can of soda and a packet of cookies. I started eating the sub, amazed that it had no cheese. By the second bite, a rancid milky taste crawled by my tongue. I opened again the bread to inspect it more meticulously. It had a certain kind of white cream with little squares solidified. I tried scraping it with my finger, or just biting it by the edge. The same distaste kept appearing between mouthfuls. I ended wrapping g the tomatoes and slices of avocado with the ham and eat it without any bread.

I changed clothes, put on my new pajama and lied in bed.it might had been a little after one. One hour or a little more passed before I could had fallen asleep.

The first alarm was set at 10 minutes to 6,it sounded just for an instant. I entered to the dark bathroom and sat on the toilet. I brushed my teeth although I hadn't eaten any food yet. I shaved with the machine with the faucet running. I had little black spots but the machine did close to nothing.

I combed my hair with my fingers and the serum my mother bought me. He was the next to use the bathroom. Was he annoyed because of me waking him up? Yesternight we stayed in the little living room of our room, sitting in the two chairs, eating, talking. He was nice enough. He heard my name. I know it because he remarked how I was a FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, too. That is actually correct. I didn't know it, none of his four ones.

Would another man had made a comment? Asked something? Why do I wear that kind of clothes, why do I look like that? He actually was the one besides me in the plane. His hair is long and his beard, too.

I feel a rumbling in my stomach. I did eat breakfast. I drank coffee, too, and I feel drowsy and tired.

This thing should had started 8 minutes ago.

I put on the slim pants I bought. They are more flexible and comfortable than other pants. I did like them. They look the same, though, the cut is similar, they're not more tapered than other ones. The shirt they gave is a boring kind of green. It's a man's one. Maybe they all were the same. I stepped down to the breakfast buffet. I took my pills with me wrapped in a little tissue. I had planned taking them in front of Hilda. Yesterday after landing and disboarding the plane, she asked me to hold her sweater. "I have to take my pill". "oh, is it for your throat?" "No, they're actually anticontraceptives."she answered back nonchalantly. I could do the same.

"Why do you take so many pills?" "Oh, they're just anticontraceptives."
It's funny trying to imagine her face, her reaction.

"These two, they make me smile, this one makes me cry more, this one makes me less manly, and this one makes me not being pregnant."

Did thus saved already? I lost an almost 200 streak because of a fucking phone.

It appears to be starting.






### 2016-05-31

Fuck me. It would had happen again had I not returned to try again.

I'm home. I've returned from my trip. Rene sent me a text message asking if he could see me at 10 or noon. It's better this way, I guess. It's fine.

On the way home, I told the woman Ruth, the coordinator of scholar services that I would be coming home with my parents. I fell asleep most of the way. I could not sleep in the plane.

The last entry, the one from the day before, is written from the auditorium. Did I write about the bathroom? Was it the first time someone gendered me female that day?

After returning to the hotel, I went straight to my room and changed into jeans and the pinkish red tank. I planned on using the long black sweater but instead I put on the white shirt. Sixto, my roommate was already sitting down waiting for the food. I sat beside him and there were other people, too. Just men. Mostly Law students from Mexicali. They were talking about what they would do, the places they would go. The coordinator, the white haired woman was sitting on the other side of the tables. There were salad plates already placed in front of each seat.

"Gentlemen, invite your lady mates. Take them with you, don't leave them alone."

It was jr high again. I was one of the men. It was the opposite of the comment I almost posted last night about a group of only females being called by the neutral male because of my presence. Now we were a group of only men even though I was present. It's not about not being noticed. It's being noticed and still not changing anything. I didn't want to spend the rest of the trip like that. A little after came Ana and told the woman how she was going to stay with her family. "Oh, it's ok, I trust your family. I know you will be ok with them. Let me just give you my phone in case you need anything." She left. I assumed Hilda would go with her. I felt betrayed, abandoned. They would spend the day with Ana's family, they might show her the city. I would be here with these men. Just like Spain when I tried to fit in with the people in the botellones.

The salad had cheese and it was hard eating enough so the plate would not seem full. The soup was garlic cream. It tasted just as it sounds. Almost as distasteful as the way I was already feeling. The main dish was served to the side of the white haired woman. It was Pasta Alfredo with salmon or something like that. I would not eat it. I felt frustrated. I remembered my family. My family was there, too. I told Sixto I would go for my phone and to tell the waiter that he could take the plate.

Up there, I sent my mother a message. Had they already eaten? No. Could I go with them? Sure. They were downtown. I would take a cab and meet them there. I came down and went directly with the woman. "I have family here, too and I wanted to go with them..." She looked at me with an annoyed and distrusting face, "oh do you, too?" She used the more formal usted. It wasn't male, but I felt like I were in school again, being addressed as a little boy. "...yeah, they were... in the... with me... I just, would you give me your phone?". She dictated me her numbers and I heard the comments from the guys. "Oh, yeah, now everybody has family" "Yeah, his family just appeared to not be with us" "Yeah, go, don't be with them", she commented me with a lighter mood.

As I walked and exit the eating place, I saw the plate still in my table and everyone's look on me. Did they hate me? Did they comment on how good it was that I left? I was so weird anyway, I looked like a girl and was so quiet. Maybe I were gay and liked somebody there. Fucking faggot.

I felt the tears in my eyes as I asked for a cab in the reception. It was called for me and drove me there. In the way he told me about this passenger he got. A beautiful young girl who tattooed a spider-web over half of her face. He criticized her and judge her. I just followed his way and felt dirty. Would he judge me, too? Would I be changing permanently my body, mutilating it, just like her? "He was such a handsome boy and destroyed it with estrogen."

I ate with my parents in the same restaurant I went with Catherine once. My mother took several pictures. In one of them, she told my father to capture it in a way that the whole kiosk appeared behind us. "Do you want the picture of that or us [nosotros]?" "Both" she answered while we smiled and looked towards the camera. "[nosotros]..." I hear this right. the rest I don't know. I have no reason to doubt it. There was a silence and then other words. There is nothing else she could had said. "[bueno, es nosotras]".

I hiperventilated and felt my heart race. No, you did not say that. I heard wrong. I felt just like I did with the words of the Karaoke. It wasn't the pressures of the other woman just like it wasn't then the sights and comments and the auditorium. It was being addressed in the feminine. Not knowing if it was real. Distrusting my perception. That was the reason I texted Catherine and felt my eyes water again.

A couple of times while we walked and shopped around, people called me in the feminine way, or used the plural female with my mom and me.

We saw some places and took some pictures. My dad ordered an uber which took me to the hotel. There were some other students in the lobby who saw me as I stepped down from the car. I heard some of their words. "Well, yeah, but they did said we could each go our own ways."

I went to my room to charge my phone. Sixto was already asleep. I came outside to the living room. I stayed there a while and though about buying something in the vending machine downstairs. A soda, something. I walked down. There was this man in a white shirt and suspenders giving a file to somebody. He asked me if I knew him. No. It was forgotten there. He would see him today that we return.

I was planning on asking if the sodas costed something or if I could just take one, when the guy turned to me and asked me if I was from UABC, too. What did I study. Mexicali or Tijuana. Did I go somewhere, had I been there before. Oh, they were just downtown, too.

"What are you gonna do now?... We are going for a little beer, do you want to come?"

Oh, no, I'm fine, thank you, you go and have fun, it was nice meeting you. "uh, yeah, sure".

I even left my phone in my room. They were the three Law majors from Tijuana. Him and his girlfriend, other lawyers, too. And me, the psychologist who looked like a girl.

Why was he so nice? We walked a couple of blocks and entered a wings place. One ordered nuggets and the girl wings. He and I each asked for french fries. We all ordered the 5 liter thing. Dark beer. Was it Indio? It was good.

I drank, faster than most. Maybe more, too. It seemed like it. I felt my tongue being loosened. I felt just like Spain, drowning my gender dysphoria in alcohol. Digging and hole and hiding it there. I talked more, opened up. It was different to the first couple of minutes that I felt invited out of pity, ignored and invisible. Like a lost dog kept under the table for giving him what is dropped.

We returned and went to one of their rooms. I wasn't really invited, but it wasn't as awkward as I thought it would be entering.

We kept talking, asking questions. Listening to music. By the end of it, it was almost one o'clock. We talked about his thesis on the gender quota. How it is still gender discrimination trying to fill a quota on gender. At first I felt passionately about the theme, I wanted to talked about it, being heard, understood. Then I realized it was still a delicate subject and what was in the alcohol grave resurfaced. It didn't hurt but it wasn't repressed anymore.

"I don't care if you are a man, or a woman, or a chimera" almost everyone laughed, "or an alien. It's about what you can do."

I am trans. I am one of those chimeras. They don't know. Would they had invited me anyway? Would I be standing here drinking with them? Am I really this different?

He talked about going to Tijuana in September and visiting some friends. "Add him so he knows and goes, too". He invited me. I was taken in count. I fitted in.

But at what price? How would I look in september? Would they really add me on Facebook? Would they note the post I was supposed to write?

Today in the breakfast Hilda touched my shoulder and said "today you didn't sent us a message". They didn't spend the day together as I had assumed. Ana went to her family and Hilda to her friends.

In lunch, everything from the salad to the dessert was not served to me. Ranch and cheese in the salad. Mushroom cream for the soup. Pasta carbonara as the main plate (pasta with eggs, bacon, cream and cheese). And for dessert, a creamy mousse.

I was anxious about leaving. My parents were already in the airport. The white haired woman was still unseen. It was 2 o'clock and we hadn't even left the room. The check out time was noon with an hour of consideration.

Hilda and Ana were the last one to come to the bus. I sent her a message but it was unseen.

In the airport, it felt a little different than when we first went. The tickets were not printed.

I bought a ham sub to fill my stomach. I bought a bracelet to Anahi and a little bottle of coffee liquor to Catherine and me. When we landed, the little kid in front of me that didn't stayed calm the whole flight wanted to exit first. Her mother tried to keep him quiet. In a possible outburst he threw the water bottle and tried to step on it. It was taken from under his foot. He threw another step almost upon my own shoe.

The mother told him "If you step on her, she will scold you". I smiled to him. I smiled for myself.

My parents were asked if they were just the two of them. They were offered moving to one of the emergency exits. My parent answered "yes, no, we're three, we're with Him" and pointed at me. The stewardess looked at me. They were not moved.

I forgot the black sweater in my uncles' house. I decided not to return. It's the most feminine male piece of clothing I own. I will miss it.

I don't know what I'll do tomorrow. Or wear.

## June, 2016

### 2016-06-01

I've been sitting here for several minutes and I haven't started the words until just now.

The app of the Michigan's DNA study showed me that they have received the spit kit already. In two or three months I'll now if my sample contained enough DNA data to be analyzed.

I slept this morning like I did not in Guadalajara. I dreamed a lot. Three alarms I postponed before the phone rang I heard my mom's voice from the speaker telling me how she had forgotten her phone with all her alarms. At what time would I leave from home? Could I take it to her?

Sure.

Yesterday Rene sent me a text message asking me if he could see me earlier. I accepted. Yesterday, also, I set up plans with Catherine about going out. Would I wear a dress? I could wear the hoses we bought. I planned wearing something less feminine and then changing into it. My mother's call changed all my plans. I could not anymore. I would have to enter into her school and being seen by her work mates, people who know me. I would be Laurita's son.

I went to shower and shave my chest and pits, and my legs. I put on my underwear and over it the clothes in which I slept. I shaved my face and covered the little cuts with stinging alum. I came down shirtless and put on the red long-sleeved t-shirt. I put both the cream and mousse on my hair. I put on the tights, too, and the black jeans over them.

I applied some make up to hide the beard shadow. Until then I left for therapy. It was 11:20. I was late. I got into the car and remembered how I had forgotten my mother's phone. I returned for it and drove out again. I forgot the control of the fence, so I came once again.

I drove to the kinder. I got in there and received smiles from the people who recognized me. I knocked into the door of my mom's classroom. Some of her kids noticed me and called her: "teacher, your son".

I looked "fine". I was seen as a boy. I handed her the phone and went out on my way. I crossed the street and drove to therapy. I parked in the close parking lot. It's more expensive. I got one or two minutes before the session time. I was welcomed by the feminine. I walked and used the stairs.

I didn't stop talking in the whole session. Does it work if I don't get any interpretations?

 When I exited I sent Catherine a text and returned to my car. I finished my make up and put on the dress I had in the bag with the laptop. She got into the car and put hers. She lend me the lipstick Vania gave her. She noted how my tire was low. We stopped in the gas station and asked for it to be filled with air.

I drove her to argana. Or was she the one who drove? No, I drove us to playas. We got to Argana and entered. There was only the oldest waitress. She recognized us. I realized when we sat and she asked us if we were "listos" to order. It hurt even more than ever. I was wearing a dress and had make up.

I took the laptop but Catherine didn't save the episode in her usb. It didn't pass correctly. I downloaded another one. We ate and saw it. She repeated the male adjective when Catherine paid. She didn't give us our teas and yet was going to charge us. She offered to drive me. We went to La creperia like the week before. We ordered a latte and a chai. The chai one was so sweet and creamy I didn't like it. Everything was going awfully. We exchanged the beverages and left.

We stopped in the sex shop to buy lubrication. There was a cop with another person and a dog. "A little killer" she called it. When we walked to the store, he let loose little by little the dog. He came to me and I stopped. The dog sniffed me and climbed to my leg. He tried hiding its nose under my skirt.

We enter and bought what we were looking for and some water in the oxxo nearby. Three hotels we entered and exited because of the price. The first one was out of cheap rooms. The second one was way more expensive than we imagined. We finally went to the usual one.

In the room we got frisky and started kissing and touching each other. "Do I take my shoes off?" I was playful and I asked to separate her legs. I tried kicking it off and sending it to the other side of the room. I kicked it and my flat flew out of the window. We both heard the sound of leaves.

I stepped down looking for it. I mistook the bushes. A cab stopped thinking about picking me up. I finally found it and got it back.

We had sex. We talked.

"Are you ashamed of me?"

I hurt her. She had thunk about it, too, last week with Anahi's comment. She can't say she supports me if she's not able to tell her parents.

### 2016-06-02

I had a patient again. I didn't shave. I showered and combed my hair. I didn't use mousse.

I woke up later than usual. Again I almost forgot to take the pills. My grandma made me two burritos of egg and chorizo. They were warmly wrapped in the table when I exited my room. She was making Miguel something different. After I walked into the kitchen she offered me some of it or to make me some, too. I accepted.

I ate the breakfast with an english muffin. She offered me tortillas and I declined. I ate them anyway.

Today I finally finished the Snow Crash book. I didn't really like it. I'm glad it's finish. I asked Catherine which of the two books I had waiting to start. She said "American Gods".

I was still in my pajamas when Miguel showered and asked me to give him a ride to the gym. I did. I am a good sibling. Could I had use the opportunity to tell him about me? How do you even start that conversation? Is that why I thought about asking Hilda? "Hey, uh, did I look like a girl in Jalisco?".

There are just three boxes filled with pills in my organizer. I have to buy hormones. Literally hormones. I have still some antiandrogens for the time until my next prescription. I am lacking estrogen and antibaby pills. Will I dare to show my mother the prescription?

She doesn't know I am taking hormones. She knows about the testosterone blockers. She knows I want to stop looking like a man. Does she gets that I want to look like a woman? That I am experimenting changes now.

Do people notice?

I picked him up again in the afternoon. Three trips I made to the River zone. After bringing him back, I saw the episode of Steven Universe. In it, Garnet, the fusion of the lesbian couple gets separated because of plot reasons. Ruby, tries to infiltrate the Ruby squad that comes to earth. They find the rest of the gang and get into a play of baseball. The plot of a kids show does looks silly and nonsensical.

They say the names of the members of the team. Little changes go into each one. Steven stays the same. Pearl becomes Earl; Amethyst, Amy; Lapis gets the illogical Bob. Sapphire becomes Sophie.

I felt this weird feeling inside of me. I don't get why. I picked the name. I chose it. It wasn't given to me, it hasn't accompanied me my whole life. I didn't start understanding the idea of the self when my mother kept calling me by that word.

I was Ivan. They called me Ivan. I have the memories of hearing that name by my mother's voice even before I could speak.

Catherine sent me some of her pictures of her in kindergarten and grade school. I saw her growing each year, changing, becoming a teenager. The similarities between the little child and the woman I love. I will never get that. I will never have been a girl. It doesn't matter how much I change, mentally, physically, my past will always stay the same. I will always had suffered and cried and felt ashamed. I will always had been that quiet shy little boy.

Little sad Ivan, why don't you like to sing like the rest of the children? Little sad Ivan, why do you feel empty inside?
Every day you await for the days like your birthday or Christmas when you know it's time to smile. You get all you wished for and you do smile and in an instant it dissipates like the light of the candles in your cake, like the lights in the Christmas tree. And in smoke you stop smiling again, and you feel the same. Year by year, even though there are more candles, the light is dimmer.

Until there is none. There is no more waiting. There are no more smiles.

Little sad Ivan, I want to hug you. I want to be in front of you and dry your tears. I want to embrace you and tell you everything will be alright.

I know you won't believe me. You won't recognize me. You won't trust me. You'll come anyway, and you will hug me and you will cry even though you don't like people seeing you hurt.

And I'll look into your eyes and in the softest and most caring voice I will tell you it's not your fault. You've done nothing wrong. I don't blame you at all. You've done everything you could. This pain will fade.

Time will pass and you'll stop being little. Then you will stop being sad. Finally, you will be Ivan no more, and the light will bright again.

### 2016-06-03

I paid in Gusher a little less than 200 pesos for 28 pills of antidepressants. A supply that lasts me 2 weeks. I told my mother a couple weeks ago about looking at the prices of the medication in the pharmacy of Costco. Those weeks I would be going out in the evenings so there was no point in asking of going. I wanted to make use of the opportunity. I could ask them, show them the prescriptions, telling them that I'm taking those medications, letting them pay for them.

I was scared. Even now that it already passed I am a little nervous.

My grandma asked me to go to the oxxo to buy eggs, milk and tortillas. I would go out this afternoon so I'd be going before leaving. Miguel got up and they asked me. I had already gotten out of the shower. Did I have make up already? I wore the third new shirt and a bra underneath.

Nobody asked me or told me anything in the feminine form. I do notice more smiles, certain kind of looks. I know most of them are in my mind.

I went to put gasoline. The dispatcher welcomed me in the masculine form. After putting one hundred pesos worth of it, he told me how my tire was low, I should put some air in it. I gave a U-turn and stopped in the tire shop. I waited outside the car after a man in a black t-shirt approached me in my window and asked me what would I be needing. I waited a quarter of an hour. There were just two technicians and both were busy. Three times someone approached and asked me in a masculine way if I had been attended. I was wearing shades. Almost all of my clothes were man's. I was supposed to go to Catherine's house and look like a man. "Boy-mode" how they use to call it in reddit.

They use to say how when they started failing it is a signal of going full time. That use to happen months after starting hormones. I am just a little over a month in a minimal dosage. My breasts have grown. They are noticeable now. Catherine told me how in some of the pictures of Guadalajara my chest looked like that of a teenage girl.

I drove towards Catherine house. I had this blue feeling. I felt invisible and hideous. Like a tiny stinking black dot.

In her house we climbed the stairs to her old room. I was supposed to help her clean it. There were piles of stuff and clothes around it. She sat to put some shoe boxes inside the cabinet of her room. I tried some of hers. I looked into the pile of clothes she had thought about throwing away. I had this painful feeling of envy. She has clothes to throw and sell and give away. I have just a handful. I can't buy more. I don't dare to ask my parents for help.

I ate one of the breads I bought after coming home from my patients. I didn't eat again until returning from the Costco.

We went down to Catherine's living room. I interpreted the questionnaires I applied to my patient yesterday. We chatted and I helped her some with hers of the MMPI.

Her parents left to eat. They offered us to go or bring something. We stayed. We hugged and took some pictures. I kissed her. And we kept kissing until we were lying in the couch. Moments later we were in her bed, almost naked, wearing nothing but our bras. We lied besides each other with a hand between the other's legs. She came first. She hugged me and whispered my name in my ear until I came, too.

When I got home, my mother was already here. She was chatting with my grandma. Luis was asleep. He seems tired and depressed. He cried when they took him to cut his hair.

My mother told me what happened after I left from her classroom. I stayed with the idea of them seeing me, and knowing me as "the teacher's son". I didn't speak, that's how they looked me, that's how they told her. Did they know I would be coming? Were they expecting me? She explained how "that young man who just came is my son...".

Some things happen after that I just now know. One of them whispered to the boy besides him: "the teacher's son looks like a girl". He ratted him to my mom. She asked the first kid why he said something like that, expecting to hear something about the hair. "It's because his lips are red, like he just painted his mouth".

They weren't. I did put make up on. I was wearing foundation, but nothin else. I had a bra under my shirt. But my lips were normal. They kept discussing about my hair, why would my mother let me wear it long, why doesn't she force me to cut it.

She supported me. I am an adult. I make my own choices. I guess that's not as much support as I had thunk.

I went to Costco and asked about the prices of the antidepressants. They're a little more than a tenth of the price I pay in the pharmacy. When I gave him the second prescription my mother asked me what were those. I answered vaguely how it was the medication from the endocrinologist. He came back with the Diane and told me that they don't dispense Estrogens.

Tomorrow we'll go to the United States.



### 2016-06-04

I started reading again. I am almost by the fifth chapter in a novel of 20. This book is lots better than the last two I've read. This is less science-fiction-y. I'm glad I didn't start reading the back cover with the synopsis. I knew nothing about it besides that the protagonist was called Shadow. He was in prison for 3 years, he described his wife and anxiety about leaving. That known feeling I've experienced of knowing something wrong is going to happen. I read how he was called to the main office three days before his leaving. I read when they gave him the news about his wife's death.

I felt sad, I was shocked. I gasped and took my hand to my mouth.

We went to the United States. My grandma decided to go, too. She put her knee-thingy. We crossed in the normal lane. Instead of the 15 minutos to half hour we usually make, we did a little more than half hour. I wore a red t-shirt and jeans. I took a gray light jacket with me, but took it off before crossing. I think it's still in the car.

My parents left in the morning to go to the bank. I told Catherine last night how we were going to be leaving in the early morning. She was there even before I got up from bed. She was already back when we left home. She brought me a Mickey blouse. Some friend of her mother gave her a bag full of clothes for her to sell whenever she goes to the swap meet. She sent me three pictures of her in different dresses.

Until now I hadn't remembered that other time when Monica sent me three similar pictures. How many years have passed since then? I did think about Monica today. No, it was first about Johanna. Catherine understood how would be feeling sad. Do I remember her because of the times she tells me about Carlos?

Anahi started a conversation with me today. She asked me how it went my trip. Haven't I seen her since my departure?

I'm tired. Yesterday I tried doing the exercises again. I didn't finish them all. They were push ups. I couldn't I get tired. I am losing my strength.

I am glad of noting those effects, even if their mostly because of a placebo effect. Yesterday I bought the pills in Costco. Today I didn't stop in the pharmacy. Tomorrow will be elections day, so I guess I'll shower anyway. I can go after or before. Will they tell me something because of my id? No, they shouldn't. I hope they do.

We stopped in the Denny's. I ordered the fish fillet. Back home, before leaving, I took my pills in front of Luis. I want him to tell me something, I want him to start the conversation. My mother asked me yesterday and I deviated. "It's what the endocrinologist gave me". The pharmacist answered her for me. "We don't have estrogens".

She didn't see the prescription nor my name on it. Why does it make me uncomfortable? So what, yes, I chose a feminine name. I picked it myself. Where from? I don't know. It just came to me. It was the first one in which I felt comfortable. That's not really true, though. The first times that everyone used it, were awkward as hell. I don't believe them. How will I feel when I hear it through their voice?

Why can't I imagine being addressed as their daughter, their sister.

Why is it so much easier imagining going somewhere far away.

Luis confessed to my grandma how he felt sad when I was in Spain. I was so far away, all alone. How did I do that? Would I be able to do it again? I guess I will. I will in less than a year if everything goes according to plan. Sure it will be closer, but it will be harder, too. I went as a male. I will go as a trans woman.

The point is that Luis cares about me, he loves me and admires me. He was irritated and upset with everyone. Later that day, when I approached him and talked to him, he was calmer and easier going. What will happen when he knows I am trans? When he knows what happens with me and why I go to this doctor and take this medication.

He worries about me.

Will he worry, will he love me as much still?

### 2016-06-05

Why is it harder now to keep with my streaks? It's twice as hard to do the exercises. I'm tired of typing and thinking about what to write.
Today were elections. Miguel woke up early in the morning and I heard his steps and the words he exchanged with my grandmother. Yesterday, before I went to sleep, I saw the clothes I had put in the washing machine moved to the drying machine. Somebody moved them. Who was it, Miguel or my grandma? I thought about one of them taking them out now in the morning. Early today I remembered but was so tired that I stayed in bed. Later in the morning, when I checked, the clothes stayed there.

Was it then really? Or did I move them last night and put them in this very chair I am sitting right now?

I'm wearing the deadpool pajamas I bought before going to Guadalajara. Almost the 8 weeks since I went to the endocrinologist have passed, why does the anxiety of the doses have come back?

Miguel was in the same high school I was a year ago. My father brought us breakfast to Luis and me.

I was chatting with Catherine and asked her to wait for me a little. I am getting the blues.

She came. We talked yesterday about doing something. I wanted to go out. I needed to go to the pharmacy today. I took the last of the 42 pills of estrogen. 42 days and 4 of rest. 46 days taking hormones. Almost half of a hundred.

I showered and shaved. I was supposed to go to vote anyway. After that I could drive myself to the pharmacy and buy the last box of pills. My dad's pick up was parked behind the cars. I should wait for him or ask him. "Why are you going?" He would ask.

I was nervous. I should be able to talk freely to them about the medications and its effects. Sure, I told them months ago, but what's the point if I'm still hiding? I am everything but free.

We went to vote. I did, I checked the little ballot they gave me with the information I heard from the lawyers in Guadalajara. I have no opinion. I don't plan on staying here. I know who will win anyway. Everything will stay the same.

Before leaving home I said if we could make a stop in the pharmacy. "What do you need?" my father asked as I had imagined, looking straight at me from the rearview mirror. "I have to buy the medication they didn't have in Costco" My mother did a gesture of "oh, yeah, right". He kept asking, what medication? I freaked. I had thunk about this. I had cold feet and said the truth covered and disguised in technicalities. Hormones, estrogen. I could had said. He would had understood. Maybe it would had ended right there. Maybe it would be the start of a much needed conversation. "Gonadotropins" I answered lying with the truth. "What are those for?", he continued. "They're for my endocrine system." That one was true, also.

Had my mother heard about the estrogen in Costco? Did she say something to him? Did she understand the relationship about my words and the technical terms they teach you in high school biology?

I thought about their reactions in the pharmacy. It is different the faces they make when I buy the antidepressants and the ones they give me when I show them the other prescription. Do they know it;s me? Do they realize what is my treatment? Are they uncomfortable?

Catherine came home and we watched the episode of game of thrones. I offered her one of the birria tacos that were left. She accepted and we ate them with Luis sharing the table with us.

Why did I think about Monica today? "My ex", I remember using those words. What was it? Yeah. Catherine told me how she's a little unnerved by the lot of stuff I have over my bookshelf. She wants to clean it. I haven't touched there since Ieft to Spain. The things there, there is something right there that scares me. I have the ikea boxes I bought still wrapped. I don't want to go near there and move. I told her about how I still had the picture frame with "my ex". There is the tube of gifts she gave me, too. Somewhere is the box of stuff I should had thrown out long ago.

I asked her, when I was mad as hell, suspecting she had regifted the last present I gave her. I asked her about it the first time I relapsed from our long silences. She told me she had it with all of the rest of the stuff I had given her. Of course she opened it and read it.

I wasn't relieved. I wasn't angry either. It was something else entirely. I remembered one of the other times we broke up and she told me she had seen that same bunch of stuff and remembered how we were. She missed it and had realized the huge mistake it was to had broken up.

Is that what scares me? That I'll move there and stuff will come, her presents and notes and letters. Will I miss her? I know I didn't make a mistake.

I didn't talk about that with Catherine. No. It was something else. I want to leave her. I want to move out somewhere else where there won't be no more things from my past but the ones I brought there. No memories to hunt me. No buried things from past lives.

I am resigned of never being truly free here. They know, both of my parents know about me. Luis and Miguel might know, too, soon enough. But will that change anything? Will they accept it and change their idea of me as I do? Or will they also be like the memories from the distant past that will haunt me forever?

### 2016-06-06

I came to start the words. There was a 1 in parenthesis next to the Facebook tap in the browser. I clicked it thinking it was my male profile. I was wrong. The notification wasn't a text message or an advice of something new in the wall. It was a new friend request. Orozko Consultoria, the Human Resources professor. He added me. Was it a notification of "you might know this person"? Maybe he didn't recognize me and just added me because I was maybe another of his students. Maybe he did know. The picture is there and clear as day. Am I nervous? I added him, accepted him.

I woke up with a void in my stomach. Like a black hole, there was something inside of my that sucked every little bit of energy and motivation. I stayed in bed watching Freaks and Geeks in the tablet. I did the exercise until just a couple of hours ago. Time keeps passing by. Today is 6th of June. In ten days I'll be seeing the endocrinlogist. In a week I'll be getting up early in the morning, fasting and wearing girl's clothes to the lab to get my blood drawn. I did shower today. I shaved my legs. They're sore and burning.

Tomorrow I'll see both Catherine and Anahi. The day after tomorrow I'll see Rene, and the day after that, my patient. Saturday my parents will go to Mexicali and I'll ask to stay here. What will they say? I was invited to see my friends from the university. It'll be Paola's birthday.

I have a reason, several of them. They're valid.

Tomorrow I will wear jeggings. I will wear one of the tank tops and a hoodie. Why am I feeling like this? It's like a half-try.

Like if I'll fail. We will go to the beach. Why do I keep thinking I will be seen as a feminine man? I am a woman, in pajama, in a suit, in a dress or naked, I'm the same person.

Why do I feel like I have to dress the part? I can wear whatever the fuck I want.

I saw the parts of my room Catherine talked about yesterday. I actually considered doing something, grabbing a bag, throwing things, getting everything from there to the floor. Starting. Making a change.

I moved the paracords I bought months or maybe even years ago. I did a monkey fist bookmark. I used the remaining yellow cord to make a bracelet.

Catherine saw a blouse/dress in Plaza Rio and sent me a picture saying she thought of me.

She saw her patient today. I stayed in bed and ate and lied again, and went back to eat and shat and finally found the energy to do the exercises.

What is it that brings me down? 8 weeks have passes and I worry about the fucking doses again. I'll see him in a little more than a week. I can tell him then, ask him. I don't even have the lab results. The first weeks every start in a low dosage.

I answered a survey about LGBT people and relationships and mental health.

When I was looking for marbles to do the cord thingy, I found four of my old spintops. Before my dad and my mom came home, I looked for the keys of the backyard and play with two of them. I remember how to make them dance. I never actually really know how. It was a try and sometimes success kind of thing. I hadn't played with something like that in more than ten years. I was in elementary school. How easier where times then?

I remember being in kindergarten. Just learning how to write. I was given homework about copying a story to my notebook. It was late at night and it was several pages long. I remember feeling beaten, how would I finish such a thing? It was way too much.

15 years later I would spent full nights working in projects to give the next morning.

I cried and felt sad because of what Xennia did or didn't do. I liked her. I had a childish crush on her.

10 years later would I really know how love can hurt you. The ways it can make you feel alive and actually wish you were dead.

10 years ago I was taught the changes my body would go through, and told how it might be shocking and hard.
Now I am going through puberty again.

I am mending a mistake.

But whose?

### 2016-06-07

I'll start the words early today. It's a little after noon. I was supposed to go out today. I am changed and showered but still home. I know Miguel showered, too, and he might be in the living room waiting for me to go out and ask me if I can give him a ride to the gym. Why am I irritated? It wouldn't change a thing. I am going downtown anyway, the gym is on my way there. I would not deviate at all. It's not like last time that I went and picked him up, doing four trips that I hadn't needed to do.

I woke up early in the morning by several different dreams. The first one of them, the one I remember most and actually recalled in the subsequent dreams had Monica in it. Not her, technically, but her text. It was like when I was just beginning to know her. I knew more about her than most people and I hadn't even heard her voice. She did not appear in my dream. I did not see her, I did not hear her. I received a text message from her. The content is now fussy. I know she was asking me about something, how have I been holding up, she is sorry that we haven't talked and the way things were left. It was nice hearing about her, knowing something. Certain kind of closure.

I woke up to another dream and realized my phone was empty. No notifications, nothing. Everything was still the same.

In this dream I told Catherine I was sick. I might had been. But there was something else. I had shat. Not myself, I'm not sure. I went to the bathroom but there were no lights or water. The toilet was out of service. I was staying in my parents bedroom. I used the toilet but could not clean myself. I needed help. My mother came and helped me, except not in that way. She "cleaned me" but it was different. I had this sensation of being soiled, unclean. Maybe that's were the idea of being sick comes. I was handicapped and polluted. She made me kneel and with a bucket of water under me put something in my hair. Was it shampoo or soap? It was blue and thick. It came to my face and nostrils. It didn't rinse. I was drowning. I couldn't breathe and felt dirty still.

That dream changed and I was in a kind of theater. It was a show, like a play. Everyone was dressed fancy. I remember the seats were normal chairs. There were lots of them facing a big scenery. I recall seeing Jessica and Eusebio. He was wearing a suit or a tuxedo. I was walking and saw one waiter filling glasses with ginger ale. I asked for one and showed him. What was I wearing? Was I dressed in a masculine or feminine way? I don't remember feeling nervous or uncomfortable. I know I looked. I didn't avoid it. Chevo saw me and asked for one but was told there were no more. I gave him mine.

We sat and chatted. There was a news, was it a newspaper? My father was reading it. It might had been his phone. He showed me, or was it to us? A high number of car accidents in the city.

The dream changed. It might had been the stories everybody was sharing but I was in them. I walked through the city. It might had been the highway. I remember walking through a park, something like that. There were wrecked cars in the middle of the street. Stopped, without figure, painted with blood. The cars keep driving, crashing with them. Lots of heavy machinery slipping, flying, coming down with full force.

 I was scared. A semi was rolling my way and I kept walking. I thought I could go the other way in time. I didn't. It came and almost crushed me.

I woke up a little later.

My grandma said she made me some "burritos". I am still irritated. I told her I didn't want them. I spoke my mind to Catherine. I hate how she offers us food. I hate being here, living here.

I fried myself an egg and heated some of the food of yesterday. I took the pills but feel no effect whatsoever. Even from the usual dose of antidepressants. I haven't taken the new medication.

"How are you?" Catherine just asked.

I'm sad and disappointed. I'm tired and sick. I'm dirty. I'm walking through a wreck. I'm crushed.

### 2016-06-08

"It's Ivan, did he change sex? And all those times I was passive?" He joked. I told Catherine about the phone and my voice. "I don't know what to do or say" and then she sent me the screencap of the incoming messages she was receiving.

I knew since the beginning something like this could happen. I get the profile picture several times in the "you might now this person" section.

I woke up from dreams. I can't remember them. I know it was hard to sleep. Oh yeah. Last night a little before midnight my was in the dinning room with her laptop or ipad doing some work. She had her headphones on while she was busy. I wouldn't had mind except for the fact she was singing. It was a weird guttural whispering that was like a drowned scream. I was in my bed covered in the sheet. I used the other pillow to muffle the sounds that passed even through the door.

I thought about going outside and asking her to be quiet. I was trying to sleep. Why didn't I do it?

I instead grabbed the earphones from my bag and plugged them to my phone. I heard the music while I tried to sleep again.

Garab answered. After talking a little about what could she say or what would happen later, she sent him the message. I didn't change sex but I indeed was trans. He could talk to me directly.

He was playing around. He saw the picture and thought it was the profile of a girl that just looked incredibly like me. He wanted to cause her a funny moment.

I was nervous and scared. I was fucking terrified. He didn't know. He saw the picture, he noticed the similarities. He didn't know anyway.
He thought I was a girl who looked just like Ivan.

Sure, Catherine disclosed to him my situation for nothing and the only thing I could think about was how I passed.

Both Yarely and Miguel accepted my friends' request. Yarely liked my other picture.

Did I fall asleep? It was one or two in the morning when my mother came down. The door was open. I left it that way after returning from the restroom. She stepped down with the phone. She was talking with somebody. Was it the psychologist from her school? I heard half of the conversation and was irritated. I tried covering my ears. I can't remember what happened.

I just know I woke up in the morning and made myself a sandwich of chicken salad and took my pills.

I can't get over Garab's situation. He was the first person I met in the university. He was the first friend I made. I considered posting the "coming out" post to the university people just because of what happened. There is no point now, for now. There is a point still, there is no rush, though.

He reacted fine. He is happy for me. "While he (or is it she?) is happy."

Why do I have this sour taste in my mouth?

I ... I don't know.

Yesterday I wrote the words before leaving. Miguel was waiting for me. He told my grandma how he was waiting for me to leave the room so he could ask me for a ride.

I took him to the gym. I drove to the plaza of the restaurant. I wandered through the supermarket until their arrival. I bought a packet of cookies. In the restaurant we were welcome in the masculine form. The waitress who took us to our table welcomed us first neutrally, then femininely and later neutrally again, correcting herself. It was like a sucker punch in my by then sensible state of mind.

The thought of adding Monica on Facebook crossed my mind. I was the one who deleted her. She is the only contact I would add in the new profile that has both my mother and brothers.

So what? What would be the expecting outcome? Would it be better for her to ignore me or actually accepting me? Is the silence mine? Am I again the one avoiding her? I was the last one to contact her. She was the one to send me away.

The wrap I ordered came with cheese in it. I took it off with the fork but by the time I wanted to roll it up again it was a mess.

I cried there in the table.

The rest of the evening was alright. In the cafe de la flor where we went for a crepe, the waiter received us as ladies. And he even called me directly when took my plate.

I talked about that in session. Rene asked me about the medication, the doses, do I notice a change? He might be thinking about lowering the dosage. I don't mind. Now they're cheap as hell.



### 2016-06-09

I saw the patient again. I have hiccups. Twice since I started typing. The third time hasn't come. I returned from the restroom. My phimosis is still there. Is there a point in going and getting it fixed? I hadn't really given it any thought. Once I saw it mentioned in reddit. Trans women who preferred it so they would not see their glans exposed. Would it be different for me to see it that different way? Rene was the one who mentioned it months ago. It was kind of a big clitoris always covered. I remember the shock and surprise when one of those first times using the condom and penetrating and I took it off and saw the glans exposed. Yeah I attributed the discomfort to the extra sensitivity, but I was scared even before it touched my thigh.

I don't really understand how I went from starting about my session with the patient and finishing talking about my penis.

I won't see her again until after I see the gang in the park and go to the lab and see the endocrinologist. I have a whole week until giving her the last two or three tests.

I haven't started interpreting the other ones. I have three projective tests and two excel spreadsheets answered but a whole un-captured mmpi booklet filled with half a thousand items.

The exercise program of the app is finished. 8 weeks have passed, 56 days. A week before I started hormones, a week before meeting him again.

When I was looking for the tests and the manuals, I accommodated the booklet of items from the mmpi in a folder. After moving the pages I saw the green sheet of the order of the blood test. I grabbed a pen and checked the estradiol box. It does looks a little different from the other ones. Should I fill the other data? They will have my card and information from the profile. Am I nervous? I will go Monday. Will my grandma be here then still? They will go to Mexicali in the weekend. They have to give my uncle the last furniture they bought for the kitchen, I guess?

Will I go like a girl even if she's here? Yeah.

Why am I scared and nervous? What is it that I fear?

I'm wearing shorts and my bare legs are exposed. Shaven since the firsts of the week. I remember years ago how I hesitated even to tie my shoelaces. Now I am wearing shorts and nobody bates an eye. Is it better or worse?

I again considered shaving my arms. Catherine told me to wait. It will be more noticeable. I thought about getting my brows trimmed.

Rene repeated about my fractured identity. I talk about clothes, separating them in "full male, ambiguous, feminine". I am still the same person underneath.

I should start the new program. Do some exercise, move, force my body, use it. Tire it.

Catherine is on her new diet. Will she lose weight? Will she look thinner and prettier? Will I change, too? Will I look prettier, too, some day?

I had the thought crossed my mind yesterday in session but I blocked it. I kept my mouth shut and saw it fly by.

He said how it's like after an earthquake the books from the bookcase get knocked off. One by one you can start putting them on again. "A month each, maybe, after time they will be all on their place, just like you like them. And even if you don't you can take them all down and start again..."

Yeah, I know there will be waiting and time and all that. The fear I sometimes get is that I won't be here by then. I might look fine in a year or two, feel whole and complete and fulfilled. But what if I die halfway there? What if my time ends in two weeks? Everything would be over. It's possible, the possibility will always be there, and telling me the wait will be long just highs the probabilities of me not reaching it.

Tomorrow will be friday. I will start with the tests. I have to grade the projective ones, after that I can capture the mmpi answers and play with the tables and manual in excel. Look at the scales and see what they show.

Saturday I'll see Catherine. My parents will leave. What if they leave after Catherine gets here? What if they see me?

I can worry about that then, or even tomorrow.

### 2016-06-10

I was already in bed with the turns turned off and the sheets covering me almost to my face. I've read and tried watching netflix. I took Miguel to his school and showered and made exercise and walked to threw the bag of clothes I had in the feet of my bed for months and half of my closet.

Yesterday I wrote about the feelings of dying and I feel death's cold fingers deep well inside of me.

I took the pills after eating the bowl I served myself of cereal. I was fine. I did the exercise and weighted myself. 79 kilos a little more. At first I thought I be getting higher and higher. When I turned them to pounds I realized how that's not really true. I'm just where I was, not higher or lower. 174 pounds more or less.

I drove Miguel to school. I was lying on the couch watching the last episode of Orphan black when he came from upstairs all changed up and ready and sat in the living room. Or was it the dinning table? Almost when the episode was over did he ask me if I could take him there. I was in pajamas, my hair a mess. Today I did not buy a beverage.

It was there when I started feeling bad. In the morning Chevo answered my messages. We exchanged some images, memes. We have this routine were we send each other the more saddest and miserable jokes about depression and killing ourselves. Between that, we rest with some immature and stupid humour. This time I talked a little more and I showed him the screenshot of Catherine's phones with Garab's messages about my doppelgÃƒÂ¤nger and change of sex. He received them and saw it but he did not answer.

I was talking with Catherine, I asked her about what could I wear tomorrow. She did not answer. She got the messages, she saw them. It was not my internet nor hers, it said she was online. I was waiting all by myself in the car parked near my old house where I grew up for the first part of my life. That zone filled with memories. And I was all alone, ignored, left.

Yesterday there was an earthquake. It was a mild one, it was short, not more than five seconds. I was still awake. My mother was working in the living room again with her headphones on and her music knocking my door in whispers. I wanted her to shut up, to let me sleep. Be quiet. I could not open my mouth and talk. Why am I like this?

Everything shook and all quieted down.

Then my grandma came down and they talked louder than ever and I did not fall asleep again.

I finally went down a little past two, I guess. I woke up an hour before noon and was in bed ready to sleep before eight in the afternoon.

I feel like crying, this sadness and frustration all bottled up inside of me. I want to talk, to scream it to somebody, anyone. But why can't I? Why can't I let it out?

What am I so afraid of?

Before sleeping I wrote a new draft of what I could post on Facebook. I changed most of the words, there were no thank yous nor apologizing nor explaining.

It was a tad bit shorter. It felt more to the point. I guess I wanted to tell anybody so I screamed it to a pillow, where nobody could hear me. Everything's still the same.

I've thunk about sending Monica a friend request. It's not really about her accepting me. I don't imagine being her friends or even starting to talk again. It's the gesture of sending it. Knowing she will see the profile. I guess I want to be sure and confirm this feeling of rejection.

I wrote a short text of three words and I deleted it before sending it.

"Luis, I'm trans."

I read a stupid news article about a trans activist talking about this law in England that would permit people to sue trans people for rape if they don't disclose their gender history.

I read the comments and they usually didn't bother me anymore. There were not any direct offenses or attacks. It was the subtle messages. What's wrong in not wanting a partner that had a history with a crisis identity. They are straight man who want a straight woman that were born a woman.

How idiotic to think that a man who got surgery to be a woman is a biological woman deserving of privacy. We're less than half a percent of the population, why would we need rights?

It's normal not being wanted. It should be illegal not saying I am trans, damaged, broken.

Who am I to deny them the information that I am less than a person?


I keep having this idea of Catherine being ashamed of me. I thought about telling them and imagine the classic response of them being bigots and they're not the whole world. I should not worry about them.

"And your parents? and you? How won't I feel like trash if you're even scared of telling people about me"

Why do I want to bring her down, too?

There is a myth that misery is less painful when it's shared.

### 2016-06-11

There are lots of pictures in my phone. Some of me alone, other of me besides Catherine, there are a couple of my friends and even others with all of us.

Today I climbed a tree for the first time in my life. I had never done it before. Never knew how.

It was the same park of that day. I narrated it almost a year ago, I guess. It was three years ago. Our last date. Just now I put the song again. Why do I want to remember it? I won't talk about it. I'll talk about today. This new memory.

Yesterday my mother said we would not go to Mexicali after all. They went to the United States. My grandmother would stay here. I wold not be alone in the house when Catherine come to pick me up.

I cried last night. What was it? I was sad and angry and upset and I screamed in a pillow and the tears wet the other one that I did not embrace.

Catherine asked me if I'd be upset if she asked to leave early. I told her I could take my own car. We could drive by ourselves. She could return and I would not depend on her.

It all started because of that. She felt sad and frustrated. There was something wrong inside of her. She hurt me and she regret it. I told her getting a ride was the least of my worries. From there we kept talking.

"I feel sad and angry. I feel frustrated and alone and weak and worthless. I think of when my father told me I was not alone and he got mad and told me to not say it.

"And I get full of rage.

"I'm imprisoned in a cage and I feel hate. How can I say there is nothing wrong if I feel shame? How can I believe I have nothing wrong if I am an embarrasment.

"I read what people think about people like me. They are not just strangers or internet voices. It's reality. It's your family and mine. It's the whole fucking world."

She shared with me how she feels similarly. Not having the courage of telling her parents. Talking about her. Time is running out and my patience is running out, too. She wants to show me that she's not ashamed of me, she's not ashamed of herself.

I confessed how I think I will not be able to go to her wedding.

She asked me about my confinement.

"In the house, my home. In my room. I can't get out of it because I'll be seen. I have to watch out how I show myself, what I wear and when, what I say and what I don't. In Facebook, who sees what and who can notices.
In this body that doesn't change.
To the wedding I can't go in a suit and I can't go in a dress. Everyone will ask you about your boyfriend Ivan, because I'm confined to that fucking role, and months pass and it doesn't end.
I want to get out of here, somewhere nobody knows me and there won't be any memory that ties me to my past.
Somewhere I can feel free.

"You're right. It's not just the hormones. It's been almost half of the year and I look the same and everybody looks at me the same way and everything is exactly the same and I can't anymore.

"I want to run and I want to scream"

"I will break up with Ivan"

"Ivan should had died in Spain"

"You were not ready, Sofi". And I broke down and I did scream. The tears flowed and the pan did, too. And I scream at the pillow but the night heard. And it cried with me.

Luis and my grandma saw me today. I was wearing the flats and had make up and the blouse.

Everyone messed up again, at least once. Jessica and Paola called me Ivan accidentally. Jessica did not notice, Paola did correct herself.

"Sofi, would you let me put make up on you someday?"

I nodded. Of course. There is no shame anymore.

Paola brought her son, Diego. At first he stayed in her arms, with a pacifier in his mouth. In the park we walked, he laughed. Paola made faces to him and he was laughing full of life. Both of them were. I remembered my dream and felt envy.

They talked about their parties of 15 years old. Party or trip, they said.

This time I didn't think about myself. If I would had wanted one even now that I accept myself. No, this time I saw the girl in her white dress taking her pictures and I thought of whispering to Catherine "When we have a daughter, we won't give her a party."

I felt a nod in my throat and a surge of sadness and emptiness that filled me instead.

I'll never have a daugher nor a son. I've never wanted to be a father. I would never be able to.

I'll never be able to be a mother either. I'll never be able to be a parent.

I got my wish, I guess.

### 2016-06-12

Two months ago I was nervous thinking about waking up early and going by myself to the lab to get my blood drawn. Tomorrow I'll wake up again, fasting, to go and get my blood drawn. Tomorrow I'll get the results in the evening, telling me how I am regarding my health. What are the levels of my hormones. Is the estradiol high? low? Where is it located in relation to other people my age, both male and female. Will my Testosterone have lowered? Will it be low enough? Have the antiandrogens made an effect this time?

Will I be seen as Sofia? Will they remember me? Will I be welcomed differently? Better, worse?

Two months ago I made a mistake. I overestimated the way I would be seen. They saw my stubble and saw me through the woman's jeans and t-shirt.

"Patient Fernandez?" "What is your name?"

I changed my voice and they saw me through it. They tried being nice. They were afraid of being rude.

The second time I knew better. I had gone feminine to the endocrinologist. Would he had talked to me differently had I gone manly? He didn't ask me about any real life experience. He saw me, he asked me about my chest. He read the evaluation.

He named the lab orders by Sofia.

I won't put any marks in the sheet this time either. The second I went straight from his consultory. No, that is not true. That's what he asked me to do, but I came home for the card. Had I been wearing man clothes I would had changed them. I would had applied make up again. This time I was recognized but the treatment was a little different. I was referred in the feminine by the phlebotomist. She made some small talk. Again they filled the sheet with the male gender. Was it because of seeing me or because of what said the computer?

Is it easier treating me when I am not ambiguous?

It hurts more being mistaken when I go all the way.

Why did I cry yesterday? I did not. I tried to sleep but I was tired. My body ached and there were music outside. I don't remember the time surrounding when I finally fell. I just opened my eyes from a dream and there were silence. The pain was still there? Is it here now?

I didn't do the exercise today. I skipped yesterday, too, although I went to the park.

"Hi... hers... I don't want to do that to her"

They try. They worry. Why can't I appreciate? Do I have a right still to feeling broken and hurt?

I posted a picture from then in the profile. I hesitated before tagging Catherine. I don't want to pressure her more after the talk of lasts nights. I doubt there will be a change soon.

Luis will wear make up tomorrow. He asked my mom what can take it away. There will be an activity in his school. He wanted to take it off as soon as it's over. Should I feel relieved?

I would had felt uncomfortable, too, but in an extreme way. I would not do the activity. I wouldn't had to fake, I would really felt sick. What would it had been what troubled me? Would it be liking it? Confronting my own feelings? Letting it show?

I would had thought about my mother's jokes. The comments and teasing. I may had liked it, but their teasing would had broken me. I'd feel ashamed.

Is that the same reason I have both the dress and the pair of jeans for putting on tomorrow?

Luis will leave with my father. Miguel, him and my father will leave a little after 7 in the morning. I don't know the time my mother will be departing. Will she see me? Would I let myself be seen by her?

I could explain it. I will go to the lab and I have both the orders and the patient card by this different name. It's uncomfortable looking like a boy when they ask for Sofia, even though the file says I'm male. Whatever I do, however I look, I'm trapped in a contradiction. At least this way is a secret that just me and they know.

There was a shooting yesterday, this morning. Orlando. A gay bar. 50 people are dead by it and more than 50 were injured.

John Oliver talked a little before his show about it. He didn't name the shooter. He showed the line outside a blood bank of all the people going to donate. I would had gone. I who is terrified of needles and blood. I would had given mine.

I almost cried. Even writing now my eyes are watering again. People care. People support.

I am one of the even fewer, the more alienated. Would people make lines for me, too?



### 2016-06-13

I saw you today. I realize now I'm still scared of you. I see your ghost several times each month. Sometimes when I'm driving, I turn towards the empty seat and you're there, like you used to; others I imagine you signing in and a little pop up with a notification of a new message next to the picture of you. In the morning, driving from the lab to pick Catherine, my girlfriend, I passed next to your house. For a moment I thought what would be like seeing you in your patio doing something, being seen by you. Knowing you recognized my car and saw me in a dress. I picked Cath up and went on with my day. Several things happened that you would not care. You don't care about my life, my worries and fears. It's ok. You're no longer my girlfriend. You are not even my friend anymore.

After everything I was going to end the day leaving her home. I didn't want to. I like being with her, I enjoy her company. I feel loved and cared for. I thought about going for ice cream. For a minute I forgot the surroundings. I forgot about high school, I forgot about the closeness of your home, I thought about finding someone but I honestly forgot about you. In that moment, neither you nor your phantom existed. I was free.

And then I saw him. Someone from my past. The short hair and stature, unkept beard. Why would Moncayo be there, would he recognize me? I remembered the the short movies, the recording sessions. Valeria, Roger. You. "We have to go" a screamed came to my head when I saw your hair. I did not see you still. I don't remember your face. I hadn't seen his either. He wasn't from my past, he was from your future. The scream found its way through my mouth. I had a kind of fight with Catherine because of you. She has this idea that I haven't gotten over you. I'm almost half of my words of the day writing something you will never read, so maybe she's onto something.

She's wrong, though. I am not scared of you because I still love you. I can't understand how I miss you if I feel this much hate. You represent what I fear. Every time I remember something about you, a good memory, a gesture, a gift, it all comes back. Loved ones will leave me. Loved ones will judge me. Nobody is exempt from hate.

You made me face something I hate about me, too. Why am I so ashamed? I fear the conversations you might have with your boyfriend about me, the questions, the mocking, the laughing. Would it hurt me more to know you don't even think of me? Had you turned would you had recognized me? Would it be because of my changes or because of you forgetting me?

I should not care. I should not run away. I should just leave it behind.



I wore a dress to the lab. I didn't wore it from home. I changed in my car parked in front of the house. I was seen as a girl. The sheet that was printed when they drew my blood said masculine still. I wasn't expecting anything else.

I picked up Catherine and drove her to the gyn. Why hadn't she take a pregnancy test? It should had been the first thing. I am her boyfriend. Sex with me, a male, will turn up in a baby.

We ate breakfast in a familiar but new place. I ate the usual and drank coffee. We drove to make an appointment for an ultrasound. We stopped in the beach. We watched game of thrones in that coffee place from our past.

Before all that we were in Cecut. We bought balloons for Miguel, today's his birthday. Walking there she thought she saw Laura a friend of Hilda's. Then Garab was across the street. I felt a rush of coldness stiffen my back. I wanted to turn and turn invisible just like when the nana from my mother's kinder appeared in the lab. Just like later would I run from a place of my past after seeing someone from it.

A man in a bike harassed us. I looked feminine enough to be catcalled.

After crying from the realization that I am not over my feel of shame we stopped in a park from Catherine's past. We talked and played. We laughed. We found a little dog and gave him shadow to rest.

She's not pregnant. She has tumors. Just like her mom. There is no reason for her mom being and having it worse than her.

All today was about the past and health. Medical tests, consultations, waiting and results. When I got home I saw mine. I have high glucose again, my cholesterol is still high. There is something of my liver that is high as well. I read first the first tests for an idea. When I got to the hormone part I saw first the estrogen one. "less than 10" it said. Almost nothing. Maybe that was the reason he didn't order them. Men have nothing, there was no point still.

I looked the testosterone and saw no asterisk of anormality anywhere near. I saw the four and thought I did halved it. With a low dose. Wow.

Then I saw the range. 0.1 to 0.5? No. That's not right. I didn't have .8, I had 8. Why are there female range? I looked up and saw the gender changed. Female. Sex: female.

They corrected it. Someone changed it. Saw the masculine in there and considered it wrong. A medical document, a health test. I am in feminine range.

I felt happy. And again, for a moment, I forgot about everything else.

### 2016-06-14

"I forgot what I came to ask you. Oh, yeah, if I'm chosen to give the speech in my graduation would you help me?"

I made a joke if it involved make up. I know I would feel anxious and devastated if I was in his place. I keep bringing it up because I want to tell him that I've worn, too. Yesterday I wore a dress.

"Yeah, of course". I'd feel honored to help him. He is asking because he knows I gave the one in the Scholar Merit Ceremony of my school. He heard it and liked it.

I can't find the words to tell him who I really am.

I told Hilda, though.

I asked her about our trip. "No, she sees me just as always" After I told her she was accepting and thanked me for trusting in her. People don't expect it. I don't talk at all and I'm saying this huge dark secret.

I was coming from picking Miguel up.

In the morning I received a text from Rene. He was asking if we could have our session tomorrow in the morning. I saw the message instantly and tried to answer him. I was out of service. He called me shortly after.

I picked Miguel up in my shorts and t-shirt and flip flops. I had to take the right one off to push the pedals. There I was sending the messages to Hilda and waiting for the answer. I stopped in an Oxxo to put credit in my phone. We continued the conversation home. I can't open up to Miguel and Luis and I look for semi-friends. People who don't know me, who have not shared that much time with me. Those who I might cut loose and never see them again.

Catherine was coming and going the whole day. We have not had a full conversation. The longest one was when she talked with her mom about tomorrow's plans. I asked her if I could see her. I want to apply her some tests as practice before my patient. She remembered and agreed although she had plans with Miguel.

I keep looking at the pictures I sent Jessica. The results from the testosterone. The female range, it being there, controlled, in place. "How awesome that you're getting closer to what you want, not just on the outside but on the inside, too."

I thought it was going to be two months for nothing and I was proved wrong. Half of the work is done. There are some concerns still relating to the blood glucose levels and the cholesterol. I've changed my diet and am doing more exercise, still there might be some caution.

The other one was the elevated levels of the liver substance. Is it getting strained? Would I mind getting injections? Could I apply them myself or would I need my mother's help?

After seeing the female range I look up to the data and see my name and the sex. It's marked female. I'm female. Recognized by a health institution. They corrected the mistaken male mark. It was mistaken. Was it my appearance? The levels? The more fitting female range?

Maybe it was my being in a hormone treatment. Both tests before this one I was not yet on hormones nor blockers. Maybe just admitting I was taking both of them was enough for them to change their records.

Were my testosterone to shoot up would I be sent back to that male marker?

Tomorrow I'll talk with Rene and I can tell him about it. About telling Hilda. Me wearing a dress and going to the park in Saturday, the same one I went with Monica. Seeing her yesterday and having an argument with Catherine because of them. Admitting to feel shame. Projected shame.

The worry about Catherine being pregnant. The nervous of seeing the endo the next day.

Will I talk to my parents after seeing him? Will I dare to tell my grandma?

Half of the people in this house don't know about me. Both Luis and Miguel suspect things. They've seen stuff, heard. My grandma...

When Catherine was telling me about her mom, irritating me with her baseless authority and hypocrisy about Catherine's being out of the house. I was hoping she would be disrespectful to me, that she would be disapproving of me and our relationship, having an excuse of hating her.

She might had seen me yesterday in a dress and make up. I left Catherine home and both her and her sister in law were at the door.

I want them to know, all of them.

Maybe that's why I keep practicing. The moment is getting closer.



### 2016-06-16

I forgot. Again.

Just now I'm looking at both the two blank squares. I didn't come and talk about the day with Catherine. How I went with my family to the United States in the same clothes I went to session.

I'm filled with this sudden rage.

He wished me luck with today's appointment. He had seen my results from the lab. He made no comment until the end of the consult when he specified to do just the two tests he had ordered. There was a reason after all that he didn't ordered the estradiol one. I'm not on estradiol. I am on conjugated estrogen. It's equine estrogen. A bunch of equine estrogens coming from a pregnant mare's urine. My liver is metabolizing them twice.

I am having changes but they will be slow and fewer. I missed my chance again. I learned it just after coming from his office. In two months I can start by asking him to put me under a bio identical estrogen. Would he know about them? He's supposed to be this eminence of his field. Why am I coming to so many frustrations?

I was wrong the first time. The dosage is fine. .625 is a normal dosage, just of an outdated medication. My testosterone is controlled. Does he have other trans patients?

I had today the last session of tests applications. I'm done. Now it's just interpreting them and doing the report.

I feel tired, void of all energy. I missed a second effect of the medication. "Mood swings". I'm on one right now.

I haven't talked with Catherine since the end of my session and my coming home. She noticed my cutting answers.

Yesterday we saw each other. We went to the ice cream place where we did not enter that day at the beginning of the week. I applied her the tests I gave today. That was the principal reason that she accepted to see me that day. She was going to see Miguel. She saw him.

I went to Rene, and talked with him and asked him. "Have I mentioned Monica lately?" Why just now am I sensing tears in my eyes? Was I feeling sad? Why, then, am I feeling this splurge of anger boiling inside of me? Like a sudden flash of hate and a wish of screaming at the top of my lungs.

"No", he answered me. I hadn't. It was like an unintentional show of support.

I told him some things I had not said, like my wish of getting over all of this. Letting it get behind me. Not wanting to carry the trans identity with myself my whole life.

After the ice cream and the tests and going to the chicken place we stopped in the movie theater. We could not decide what to do. We ended up going home. There were some grade school girls who talked to us and waved. "What would had they said were we holding hands?" There was a deep wish inside of me of returning to her car and kissing her in the lips in front of them.

I don't mind people seeing us and judging us and calling us names. I love her. I might be a freak, a queer, something different. And it hurts of course being attacked because of who I am. But called names because of whom I love? That's nonsense. I want to hold her hand in front of the world and share our kisses internationally.

Besides her, I'm invencible.

She does not share those feelings.

It's supposed to be ok.

I have said thousands of times that I get it. That I understand and I can wait. Why am I irritated now?

Trans people from years before had been on CEE years before. One of the girls in the forum said how they were better for her than the estrogen pills.

Two months will be not a long wait. It's the same time I've been on hormones. A little less than 60 days. August. Weeks before jhonny's graduation and Catherine's parents' wedding.

I've been invited to both. I can go to both in a dress. In one I'll be with Catherine and to the other with my parents. Is that the real difference that gives me the reason to doubt?

Again, starting from 0. It was my fault. I missed the day.

Tomorrow I'll go to the laser session.

Now I'll do the exercises and go to bed.

Will I talk to Catherine?

Am I really angry at her?

I remember the reason she gave me when we parted our ways. She was tired, she had to see Miguel later. She saw her but didn't dare to ask him. She apologized, she felt like a coward. I told jhonny. I told him and she could not ask Miguel a question.

Her parents doesn't know. She hasn't broken up with Ivan. I went with Luis and my parents to the United States with a bra and a blouse and make up.

She could not come with me, again, to the endo. I needed her. I need her.

I don't feel the right to ask those things from her. Am I entitled then to feel bad because of them?

### 2016-06-17

My estrogen comes from horse piss. Pregnant marine urine: premarin.

I did laundry today. All of them is ready and folded and put in their place. Luis was lying in my bed chatting when the last batch was crumbled besides him. The gray dress the last one I wore this week was an undistinguishable ball next of the rest of inconspicuous garments. Did he notice it? Of course not. I hesitated in grabbing it and extend it in front of him so I could fold it. I told him how I could not carry the boxes anymore. I lost my strength. That's true.

I had to shower but avoid shaving. Yesterday I shaved before leaving for Rene, some hours before noon. The lady from the spa probably didn't believed me. The last two sessions I went with 12 hours fresh shaved face. This time it would be just as I was advised, 24 hours.

I took the two pills 40 minutes before the session.

In the shower I thought about the day counter app. It's more than a month since I masturbated, the last time we had sex was at the beginnings of the month. Approximately two weeks.

I realized that the dosage of estrogen I'm on, it's not that low. There won't be much changes and there's not lots of evidence to monitor because the levels can't be tracked.

Just yesterday I realized and thought about that. In the shower I felt this flashing sting under my left nipple. I had told Catherine about the sudden aches in my breast I supposedly had experienced, but this was different. I didn't even relate it to that aspect of my life. At first I thought about a slash with the razor, a shaving burn, a spot of irritation. I did not shave, though. Did I yesterday? I didn't feel anything like that. I looked for something but there was nothing there. Then I remembered the hormones.

I decided to touch myself to have an explicit starting day that I remember. A last one, a marking point. And so I tried. I got into that familiar position of reclining to the shower wall with my face buried in my upper left arm and my right hand stroking that unwanted and almost dying member.

I could not. It had been hard lately, but there was nothing compared to this. Not even the erection was full. I resigned myself and shut the shower.

I sat in the toilet and started again. This time I could culminate the self loving session but nothing came out of it, nothing material anyway. There was a climax but not physical manifestation of the pleasure felt. Like a blowed kiss or a muted scream. This was new, too.

I went to the laser place but the parking was full. Twice I entered and exit. I found some spots in the third floor, the guard instructed me how to enter.

I was welcomed by the technician. The session was delayed by a short wait so the machine could be hot enough and ready. Today it hurt more than the two first times. Even the cheeks were the familiar hot flick of a rubber band. When the laser shots went down to my neck and chin, it was a more intense pain, a more scorching and deeper penetration of hot pain. Finally, the upper lips had me in tears. I had closed my eyes, so I didn't realize I had fogged the protection glasses until I took them off. In there the sensation was exactly as a burning red little needle sliding itself into my skin.

She asked me if I use solar protection and I lied. Before the session she asked, too if I had shaved. That was the truth. She probably disbelieved me both times. The next appointment was going to be in two weeks, she didn't ask the time, just offered the two dates.

I corrected her, but instead of giving her the fourth week, I proposed the third. In four weeks it's going to be the pride. I won't be going in a sore and dark shadow of a day after laser.

I did laundry today. I reclined myself in the washing machine to grab one of the last socks in there. My weight pushed my right breast into the edge of the machine and a blinding pain made me get up. Just at the height of the nipple. I was surprised and perplexed and took my finger to that same place to try to replicate the experience. Is that really happening?

I'm on two months now, and there are some effects. They are starting.

Liliana answered my message in the morning and I didn't dare to mention my situation. Maybe in the weekend.

Vania answered Catherine back about her situation and messages. She didn't know me that well, but she didn't expect it. About her, on the other hand, she already had some suspicions.

Catherine filled her journal and mine stays now right besides the tests I should had interpreted by now.

### 2016-06-18

Have I written the words in my tablet before? Will this be the first time? Should I write with just one finger? Or maybe use both hands.

I'm in Mexicali, sitting in the couch of my uncle in the living room. My mother, and uncles and cousins and probably my grandma, even, are in the pool. Even before coming u had decided I would not get in the water.

What was my reason?

The changes are coming fast. Yesterday I had chest pains. Even sleeping I would wake up in the night with a soreness inside of my breast under my nipple. I know I had different dreams. Now it's harder to remember how I looked and felt in those. Was I a man? Was I a woman? It's not just looks, sometimes I know I look as always, others I'm a completely different person and yet, in both of those situations I would have this familiar feeling of uncertainty of how people look at me. How am I perceived?

But that was not important in these dreams. I now there were strange unknown people with me in those different and unfamiliar persons accompanying me. None of them was Catherine. One was Monica.

There is kind of a theme in the latest dreams where she makes appearance. In most of them I have new and recent information about her. Somewhere inside our conversation is some kind of apology or gesture of making ammends. The initial kindle of a reconciliation, a new foundation of a new fraternal relation.

There is no romance. I guess. Not that I remember explicitly. Although I can recall the feeling of guilt and secrecy. Why is never Catherine in those dreams?

I decided not to mention it, just as I didn't mention either how I ask RenÃƒÂ© if I've been mentioning Monica in my sessions.

She started today's conversation with her own dream.

"we didn't know each other. We met in a hotel. There was like some kind of congress and we met there. We skipped the conference and I asked you to follow me. We got into an elevator and I took you to the seventeenth floor, the second to last. It was like a parking lot. It was like the hotel down too. Like that, but the 17th floor. And there we talked and it was cheesy...

We stayed until dawn and said our good byes. Then I don't know what happened. I kept coming back to that floor looking for you but you weren't there.

The congress was over. I sneaked into the elevator and went to the 17th floor, but nothing.

It was as if I were from the city, but you were not.

Until I stopped going.

One day I went to this party in the hotel with some friends and we were already leaving for the parking lot in the first floor and I saw the elevator's doors open and I ran. I wanted to press the button for that floor but it only reached the seventh. The doors closed and it started going up. It went up to the 18th floor but as it passed the seventeenth I saw you sitting.

So I got out in the last floor and ran down the stairs. We saw each other and I hugged you. You had two closed bottles of penafiel lemonade. You were also waiting for me.

You were dressed with the leggings and the striped blouse. Your curl was a little longer.

I was wearing a pink long dress."

Mine was some kind of trip and a house somewhere far away. It wasn't important or worth remembering. I've forgotten most of it already.

We came to mexicali to celebrate father's day. I'm alone in the living room, though.

Catherine video chatted with Carlos from Chile. Today was the match of our countries in the American tournament of soccer. They won.

My mother gave me a thousand pesos for the analysis I paid. It's just 3 weeks until pride. I'm almost out of money. I haven't interpreted the tests nor started the report. I haven't mention the wish of meeting with Liliana for asking her advice about my situation.

The changes are coming faster than ever. I'm starting the third month. Two full months have passed since I started. I'm wearing only male clothes and still I sent the picture to Catherine and she told me how I looked feminine.

I mentioned something about my shoulder hairs to my mom when my father and brother were taking the boxes to my grandma's house.

"Well, they're supposed to fade away, aren't they? That's what you said, what is expected." She was talking about the hormones. There was something in her voice, this kind of subtle thrill and excitement, as if talking about a secret in the open, just hidden enough to obscure the true essence of the unknown information.

Well, I have some hairs. All of us women have somewhere.

Was she talking about them women, or us women.

Which one do I really prefer coming from her?

Is this saved?

Yup.

### 2016-06-19

Three day streak. Yesterday I did not make any exercise. We went to Mexicali. I could had not gone and it would not had made any difference. The people, the chatting and their voices, all the noise and tumult irritated me. I sat in a chair next to the dinning table between the living room and the tv room where everybody was. Karla was with her boyfriend sitting in one of the sofas. She did't introduced him to me. Maybe she didn't realize. I was just in the middle, I was the break of the two segments in which she separated the turns of meeting.

I felt awkward when my uncle, Beto, asked everyone to mock him. Tease him. Would they treat Catherine that way? Would it be awkward? It's expected of me to taking a girlfriend to a family reunion. To them I'm the oldest son of Laura.

But I am not. I am not her son. I am not a man with a girlfriend. She is my girlfriend. But I am not whom they think I am.

I should not be thinking about that. Yesterday I had the nervousness and premeditated anxiety of them knowing. I don't fear much about Edgar or my uncles, not even my grandma now. But what about the people who don't really know much. How about Irving and my uncle and aunt? What about Ivana, the niece of my aunt Luisa?

I am that nephew of Luisa who has this pretty long curly hair.

"Oh, he was queer, alright" "He ended up being a faggot" "Yeah, he's not Ivan anymore. Now he's Sofia".

I can hear the laughs, or the awkward silences. It annoys me and scares me.

Again I took and wore only man clothes there. I looked feminine. I had a beard and yet it was out of place.

The sun was scorching and the heat unbearable. Today I had my tank dripping in sweat. There was a huge wet spot in my whole back and several dark ones in my chest. It was more than 115 F.

We stopped in the Ikea where my father and Miguel returned the furniture my uncle didn't really need. After there we stopped to eat in the Jack. I accompanied Luis to the subway where he ordered a sandwich. He actually ordered it in english. I felt surprised and a little proud.

Yesterday in the pool he asked for a shirt. He was covering his pecs. My mother was annoyed when she told me. It was like if it were something weird and annoying, upsetting. Does she notices the signs, too? There are too many already.

He cried when they cut his hair, and now he covered his chest in the pool? It's not just paranoia anymore.

After crossing the border I asked them to stop at the pharmacy. My father came with me. He bought a packet of pads for my mom. I asked for estrogen and anticonceptive pills and he bought pads. He was there when the pharmacist returned with the purple and pink box and told me how they were out of aldactone. I asked for the generic and he gave me a different one from another lab. My father paid for everything.

My mother, yesterday when we stopped after the first booth, gave me a thousand pesos for the amount I paid in the blood work. Now I have a little more than two thousand. The pills are stocked for a month. The happy pills I have two weeks, but in Costco they are dirt cheap. Less than two dollars for two weeks.

I have a throbbing headache and Catherine asked me to not interpret any tests while she did the dishes.

It's sunday, I have three days without today to finish the report. I have to finish tomorrow, at least all the tests but the MMPI. I have the Rey complex figure, the rey learning test, Bender, Machover, HTP and MMPI. 6 tests. The most complex is the Inventary, although that's the kind of work I enjoy the most.

I got distracted. I thought I had finished already. I was reading the manual of the Rey complex figure. I opened up Facebook and considered sending a message to Melissa telling her about me.

My head still hurts. I ate three tacos of lamb in the morning and in the evening 10 nuggets with fries. I sweated all day and had to endure the sun. I don't think I'll do the exercise nor the tests today.

It's sunday, it's father's day.

Today I'll rest.

### 2016-06-20

Today I'm again a penguin.

I remember the day I lost my more than 190 days of continued writing. It was all for naught, like an immense tower clashing down. Now it's funny starting again. Small numbers change quicker. The four will turn into a five, when the week before it was a 0. The other bigger number will turn into a 60. 90 will be the third month, a little after pride. 120 will be a little after the next appointment to the doctor. The fourth month checked when I'll attend jhonny's graduation and the Catherine's parent's wedding will be done.

What will happen then?

Catherine came and we lied in my couch to watch television. The second to last episode of Game of thrones we saw here. The Battle of the Bastards. Jon Snow fighting for his brother Rickon, against Ramsey Bolton. After that, we saw the first episode of Orange is the New Black. Miguel got home a little after Catherine arrived. I was offering her an apple when the sound of the keys made us turn.

I did the exercise. I weighted myself before Catherine came. I had put on my shorts and tank. I stepped in the scale and expected a bigger number than before. I've eaten without care and skipped various days of activity. I was surprised when the number was lower than the one that gave me the endocrinologist last thursday. 79.1 kilograms. It's higher than in high school, higher still than my return from Spain.

I'm comfortable anyway. I'll keep losing it. Today was my first day of rest from the Elrredin, or premarin, or horse piss.

My mother arrived after Catherine took me home, yet she entered first as I was sitting in Cath's car chatting about the procedure of SRS in Thailand. Will I do the procedure? Do I want it?

We went to the Kasas Cafe outside the high school, in the plaza where I will park my car the day after tomorrow before walking to Rene's session.

My mother said something that made me cry. I had forgotten about the app. Will the number of days since crying will ever reach a number higher than 7?

She asked me directly had I congratulated my dad yesterday for his day. "You didn't either, did you? None of you did. He told me."

She's right. I did not. I did not hugged him or congratulated him, I didn't thank him for all he's done. I didn't smile at him or even see him to his eyes. I can't even type a sentence without closing my eyes to clear them from tears.

Why is it that I'm crying? What is it that makes me sad? He's the one who should be disappointed, not me.

I told Catherine how I was ashamed of it. I can't even imagine going and doing it. I am not his son. I am not his daughter, either. How can I congratulate him?

It's not that he's not my dad, he is, he is my father and he's always been. It's not what he is or isn't. It's what I am not. It's his day, not mine. But how can I note him when I don't fulfill my role?

Sometimes I do wish I had no parents. Not because I am ungrateful, not because I would want better ones, but because I don't know what to do with what I have.

I'd give up their support and caring in hearbeat. I love it and appreciate, but I can't reciprocate. I can't see them to their eyes and show myself. I can't let them know me. They would be better with just two normal sons. Not the first one, the broken one.

Yeah, I was his pride, I was supposed to be successful and this example of man. But I am not. I am something else. I am something you get ashamed of. I am the name you avoid saying in a conversation and hope nobody asks you about. You don't want to mention me or be seen with me.

I don't want to be seen.

I do want to be seen.

I want to be able to show myself. Why am I ashamed? Why do I hate me so much?

Will the hormones change this about me? They'll with modify my body and state of mind. Will they let me love me and accept me and be pride of whom I am?

Will I ever let anybody see the real me without fear?


### 2016-06-21

I spent the whole day messing with Excel. The projective test of the human figure was interpreted in less than an hour, the four drawings and the two stories, even the symbolism. Everything was done. What was supposed to be the easy and enjoyable part ended up swallowing my whole afternoon.

Yesterday came a couple of hours ago while I was in deep trance trying to understand and come up with the complicated formulas that would give me the result I wanted. He asked me if I would like to go to a camp out day of his school. It was because of father's day. There would be games and activities and stuff. It was going to be this saturday.

I'm scared of it. I told Catherine it was because of the sports. Playing, matches. I'd end up losing. I would embarras him as a big brother and my father as a son. I am neither. How can I go when I'm stop being that person?

Will anyone notice? My body is changing. I am changing, the changes are obvious. What if Luis classmates notice and tease him?

What if they don't notice? What if everybody sees me as his big brother and we end up winning and everything is alright? Would I be happy? Would I end up wishing everything was different?

No matter what I do I end up losing.

I can't not go. I can't stay away. Go further.

I am away. I don't reach for them or look for them or approach them. None of them know my name. I haven't told anyone in this house. I wish I could skip the intermediary. Go from Ivan, the big son that is a man, to Sofia, the oldest daughter who is and looks like a woman.

I try to imagine it. Me looking the part, having the voice, the presence, everything. But it's like if there was still an essence that would never go away. A phantom of who I used to be.

Miguel called home for me if I could pick him up. He was in the Taxi stop near home, the one behind the neighborhood. I actually never took that ride back. It was always the opposite way, in the whole semester I used the taxi I never used it to return, never knew where to take it.

I planned and tried a couple of times. It was easy, take it home and just climb that hill and walk home. A couple of minutes. He called me to pick him up. I used the opportunity to put gas. Tomorrow I'll go with Rene and return home. I won't apply make up, I won't dress femininely. After my session I'll came back and finish the report. Now it's just interpreting the results and writing the conclusion.

I washed the sheets of my bed, both the ones that were in it and the other ones behind the basket of laundry.

What could I write?

Nothing interesting happened today. I made breakfast after I woke up near noon. I stayed in bed, tired. I took the second resting dose. Just two more days and I'll be back on that piss. When I grabbed the sheets and put them against my chest I felt the soreness on the right one. It's still there.

My face seems rounder. It's almost noticeable, but the change is there.

I thought about sending the picture to Chevo, the one where a father is grabbing a bottle of pills and asking "Son, what are these blue pills for?", the next vignette is a trans girl obviously feminine shrugging her shoulders.

Would he understand?

We send each other almost only sad and depressing memes. They're cynic and ironic. A dark humor. We both know the sweet pain of melancholy. It's as if we share this secret joke. We laugh of that shared pain we both remember.

We use those jokes as a way of reaching out to each other. "It's your fault that my phone is full of memes, (more, please, don't stop)".

Is that his way of being here for me? Would he get uncomfortable at that intimate joke? That's something we don't share. That's intimate. That's me telling him I'm alone at home. I'm mute and this secret is eating me from the inside. I want to tell them but my mouth is closed. I want to talk, to scream. I want to be seen, but I am terrified that after showing myself, they'll turn their backs to me.



### 2016-06-22

I went to therapy. Again I dreamed. Something like an episode of How I met your mother. Except I don't remember any episode that had a similar narrative. It was surreal by nature. I was in the place of Barney. There were different places of a house. Certain symbolic clues. I realized they had to do with my real self and not the persona I was in there. Subtext of feminization, closets, clothes hidden.

I woke up with the urge to pee. I woke by it.

I have my wallet right next to me. I payed 250 pesos to Rene today. I did not pay for the hormones, my father did. I payed for the gas when I picked Miguel up yesterday. I feel this strange desire to open it up and check its insides, count it up. I know I have the mason jar with more than 20 coins of 10 pesos.

There are, easy, more than a thousand. This week I won't earn a salary. I had to cancel the session with the patient for tomorrow.

Yesterday I spent the whole day messing with the spreadsheet of the scales of the MMPI. Today I finished another table with the punctuations interpreted. It was my surprised when I realized that she had the clinical signs of schizophrenia. Should I mention it in the report, I should had showed it to Liliana before. I don't do more tests that deal with psicosis. I don't know the Rorschach. I decided to send her a message and she read it immediately. She told me to postpone the meeting. This project would be cancelled, suspended, until we checked it thoroughly.

So it is done. We didn't agree to a day or time. I hope she doesn't call me tomorrow to appoint it for Friday. This Friday I had plans with Catherine. I want to go to the United States. I want to buy something for the pride. I want to wear something new. I want to look pretty and feminine. I want people to see us and see a lesbian couple, not a woman with her transgender partner.

Today I wore casual clothes. I had to return after the session and continue with the report. Which I haven't actually started. I've finished with MMPI, all the tests are graded and interpreted, now it's just matter of integrating them together.

Rene asked me about my meeting with the endo. I talked about the hormones and my expectations. How I am taking conjugated estrogen. Why am I not taking a bioidentical one? I'll wait two more months until I can ask him myself.

I talked a little about my dad, father's day. We didn't congratulate him and it pained me. I found it hard, impossible to do, to reach out.
I cried while I was speaking. I grabbed a tissue and continued.

My mother explained me now what was exactly what Luis asked me. It's something outside in a ranch. My father would not go. I could take him instead. Of course not.

Why am I scared of being alone with them? She came down and thanked me for doing the pasta. It's nothing. She asked me but it really was nothing. I don't mind. Was she going to ask me something else? I am scared of the silences again, but it's not the same reason.

My chest is growing. This was my second to last day of rest and the ache is still there. Fading and barely noticeable but it's there. Even with a male t-shirt, I look ambiguos. I like this ambiguity. I am comfortable in it, for now. It's intentional, I can abandon it and leave it behind. I can't embrace it and look masculine. For now. I talked how in Mexicali I looked feminine. Even with male clothes, there was something in the outfit and my face that betrayed me.

Now I have no excuse. I have to see Liliana and show her the tests. I can use that moment to tell her.

"Yeah, so I will do this with the report and the results. By the way, there is something else I was meaning to tell you. It has to do with the patients but not really with her. I don't know what to do.

See, I know you know about me, Catherine has told you, and you had me in your phone as Sofia. I am not Ivan anymore. I thought it was going to be easier staying with that persona profesionally, with patients, while I leave for the master, until I transitioned.

But that's the thing, I have started transitioning. I started laser and I started hormones. I have been taking them for 2 months now. There are some changes, subtle, not very obvious, but there are. And there will be more, and I honestly don't know what to do."

I did the dishes. I actually surprised myself with that one. What was it? I didn't want to do the report. What about it scares me? There is not my fault, the test throw those results. They're not from the projective tests, they're textual questions she answer and admitted herself. I ran the program with the different possible erroneous answers. They are invalid. The results are valid. They all are interpreted, what scares me is making the integration, putting my own words and signing them.

The most I could do is write in the report a recommendation to follow up with the evaluation with a more experienced psychologist or psychiatrist.

I'm scared of asking of Liliana the follow up meeting. What is it, the confirmation of my work or the chat that I've been delaying?

I have to tell her. I should. She ought to know. I am in transition. I've started. I'm changing.

Right now I've just come out of the shower. I'm wearing gray shorts and a blue tank top. My face is red. Was it the hotness and humidity of the bathroom? That has never happened before. My skin would be softer and clearer. Is this it? I look different in the mirror, my face has had tiny subtle changes. They're more than welcome.

My father asked me today to carry the gallon of water. I could not tell her I can't anymore. I tried. It was the one with the handle so I grabbed it from it with one hand and supported with the other. I could, I carried it to the kitchen. I put it against my chest and a soft pain in the right breast caught me off guard. Today was the last day of rest. Tomorrow I can start again with the blessed piss.

I told my parents that I'll go to the United States tomorrow. I have the money. A little less than a thousand and a half pesos. Less than 80 dollars. A little more than half.

I drank the mason jar of lemonade soda. It tasted like glory. I'm supposed to hate the sugary drinks and yet this one was amazing. Was my sugar low? I did the exercise and ate a bowl of cereal for breakfast. I ate after Luis and my mother arrived home. One torta and a plate of pasta. I don't think I'll eat anything more.

Today I weighted myself. 78. something kilograms. Was it half? More or less? Anyway, the number keeps coming down. It's a week after being weighted in the doctor's office. Almost a kilogram. That's great. It could be the losing of fat or the shedding of muscle. I hope it's the latter.

I think I'll refill the glass with water.

I can check if the redness has receded.

It's less red.

Who knows.

What is it that I want to buy tomorrow? Catherine will pick me up. The plans changed. She'll pick me up and I'll pay for the parking. Had I a coin in the car? Maybe from there I could pay it. How much dollars would I get? Will they be enough? Which would it be a better outcome, returning home with all my money or not having enough money to buy what I liked?

I decided to wear the leggings and a blouse, the one with the duck tail behind. Will they be feminine enough? Will I look too feminine?

Being trans is not illegal. It's not reason enough for keeping me from crossing the border. I should not be nervous.

The report is still unfinished. I'm halfway through the results. I don't think I want to write the conclusions until talking with Liliana.

Luis asked me today about pseudohermaphroditism. He didn't use the term, but yeah. It was something I said. I said I had no penis, not anymore. I sold it.

He's 12 but not stupid. Does he get me?

Tomorrow he won't go to school. He'll be home when Catherine comes pick me up. Will he see me? I honestly don't care. I thought about saying something about my legs. Showing them to him, telling him to see them, feel how soft they are.

I dreamed something about him. No, not him. It was Miguel, he had a seizure and I tried to see if it was an embolism. He was faking and continued saying how I was not able of taking care of nobody. My mom agreed with him. I cried and tell them to fuck themselves thinking how I will never have children. The other dream I took something from Luis, a little chain. I stole it. Why?

In another one, I was in a bar. Was I in hiding? I was doing something or waiting for someone. The girl was next to me in the border of the second floor. She was talking to nobody and annoying me. I told her she lost her watch. When she reclined to see I threw her off.

The third one was different. It wasn't me. I wasn't me. I was a young boy with a group of friends. We were in this kind of party or reunion inside a house. They called me Ivan, but I didn't look like him. I don't think I was wearing any costume. In the couch I was seating in, I found a red female necklace. It was ugly. I wore it to be funny or something. The people who were with me saw me no differently. Zayra came out of nowhere wearing this flowery dress. She came to say hi and approach us. She didn't recognize me. "I thought it was Ivan, because he's always with you, but no... you're dress as a lioness, how cute". She touched my hair. I didn't understand. I was seen female.

After it some things happened. I realized people who saw me put on the necklace didn't see me different, but those who saw me with it, kept seeing me as a girl even taking it off.

When I talked with Hilda and she didn't recognize me proving my theory right, I told her my name was Sofia.

It's easy trying to analyze the meaning of the necklace and the relationship with kept being seen as what I was before.

### 2016-06-24

Luis is right beside me. We're joking about Magikarp. He tried throwing me my own pillow while I'm typing. "Magikarp, I choose you".
He continued with the joke about Professor Oak, "are you a boy or a girl?".

Is he joking because of something.

He asked me what did I buy. I told Catherine I would tell him, jokingly, that I'd bought dresses. I did not tell him that. "Clothes", I said. I did buy dresses. I could not tell him and yet I grabbed the keys and went for the bag in the car. "Can I see what you bought?" I told him no.

"I'm talking with my mom. Finish your words."

I started them. Something happened. "Tell me when you're finished." "Is everything alright?" "We talk soon."

Is it about me? Maybe she saw the Facebook, maybe it's because it's late. Did she tell her she helped me buy clothes?

I was supposed to leave before Luis got up. I woke up early in the morning. It was even before 7 when I had my eyes open and had left the dream. It was again with Monica. We were in a hotel in Spain, not the two of us. We were four. Was the beds shared or the rooms? I remember that I share something with Homero, from grade school. The other ones were she and Mariana. There was something weird in Mariana. It was as if she were one of Monica's friends from college. As if she liked her more than me.

I remember getting in to the bathroom to get dressed and ready. The two girls would leave and I wanted to be with them, close, near. I had to hurry. Why did I want that? I remember seeing the black bra in the bed and Homer noticing it. He grabbed it and played with it. It was mine, I was nervous.

The whole dream was weird and uncomfortable. I don't want to share those times even with her memory. I try to get away, but I can't. Why can't she stop appearing in my life?

I waited until 10:30 un the morning to leave the house. Luis got down from his room. I was wearing the leggings and the striped blouse. I had just make up. In the border crossing several people approached us as ladies or called us girls. Luis saw me that way but said nothing. Since then almost everything was hard.

There was traffic leaving my house. The road that usually takes me 3 minutes, lasted me 20.

After picking her from her house, we took the highway. There was a strike of the transportists. We got to the zone of the border by near noon. There was no free parking. The parking lots were all full. Everywhere, everyone. I actually thought the trip would be cancelled. I would end up dressed and with the wallet full of money.

We got in a parking lot from downtown. After two cabs we were in line waiting. An hour and a half approximately after, we bought the tickets of the trolley. The first place was In n Out. We bought burgers and fries. None of us dared to ask for the spread.

She finally did. It was delicious. We took the trolley back to the Plaza las Americas. The first store was Old navy. In everyone I used the dressing rooms. In there I tried two dresses. One white and the other denim. The denim we both liked, but it was too tight. The button in the middle kept popping itself out. The white one was too loose down in the torso but the shoulders were tight.

The second store was one we both never had gone. Two dresses as well. The first one white and the second coral blue. Both were A-cuts.

"I want a dress" I felt an uncontrollable sensation in my insides. It was a combination between a tingle and a nervous shock. The anxiety of an unexpected fear and the excitement of a new discovery.
"What kind?" She took a normal amount of time to answer. I will never know what went through her head or what was her reaction. I could not see her. Those were the first statements I dared to declare, both to anyone and myself. I didn't expect that. A continuation, "keep going". I did not know.
"For you, an A-cut"

The white one fit better than the last. It was L. The coral blue was Medium. After seeing the white one I didn't expect it to fit. Catherine offered to look for a medium one. I said yes, but wore it anyway.

It fit amazing. I liked how I looked, my body, my face, my hair. I could not believe how It fitted. I did not buy it. The color was not of my liking.

I spent most of my money in Ross. In that dressing room, I took the limit of garments permitted, 8. The lady in there liked my hair and complimented me on it. After that she sent both of us to the left, the ladies section. Do people notice I'm trans and treat me nice because of it, with their smiles and compliments. Or are the amenities precisely because they don't know?

In there 4 things were discarded and the other four put to consideration. I bought three of them and paradoxically left behind the dress I liked the most. It was a dark brown or gray dress with black in the end of the skirt. The skirt was long and formal. It looked classy. Catherine described me as a girl going to church. "You could use it to the ceremony of the wedding of my parents."

If I liked the way I looked in the dressing room of the New York store because of how the dress fit me. I liked the way I looked in that dressing room of Ross because when I saw me wearing it in the mirrors of it, I was not embarrassed, I was not uncomfortable nor vulnerable. I looked like how I felt in the inside, like a woman.

I would wear it in front of Catherine's parents and the world.

I am indeed changing.

### 2016-06-25

I don't know why, but right now I feel like lying in bed and closing my eyes and let myself drift into slumber. Why am I so tired?

I told my parents about my patient. I said no names and no way if identification. Was it a breach of confidence? There is no connection from me to them. I shouldn't had said it.

My father yesterday asked me if I wanted to go to the United States today. I could had bought the shoes. I wouldn't had to wait that much. I fell asleep with the thought of having all those new clothes that I could not really wear. I tried them, I tried most of them and saw how they fit. Why had I still the idea of them not fitting, of having made a huge mistake?

Yesterday I took the pill, too. This is not the first day of restarting. Am I feeling their effects again? This fatigue and loss of energy, the changes of mood, the hopelessness. Are these because of the pills?

I bought a lot of things in the stores, both yesterday and today. Yesterday it was clothes and dresses and stuff. Today I bought razors and shaving cream and sun blocker and a nick stick and a filer for the papers and tests and reports. After returning home, I ordered the printer from amazon and a stick of alum and a pack of soaps. There was something else in there. Oh, right, a daily cream with sunscreen.

Sunscreen, that's the real translation.

Why am I feeling lighthearted? Is it the lack of testosterone? Maybe the estrogen pills aren't doing its effects. I'm blocking this hormone and the supply of the other one is not effective. I'm low on fuel.

I ate more than other days, and drank tea. It's not a matter of energy. I woke up early. I know I dreamed something again but I can't recall it.

In target I wandered through the girls section. I looked at the clothes, mostly the jeans. The sizes, the prices. Why did I feel so, uh, ...

I'm having a hard time even writing these words. Should it be a matter of concern?

My mother went out today with Norma and Jessica. She went to this show of opera of her ex-student, the friend of Diana. In target, when I checked Facebook, both Diana and Jessica appeared me on the list of people I might know. Diana had Yarely and Catherine as common friends. Jessica had none. Was it yesterday when my aunt Paty appeared me as well? Miguel, Caio, the italian girl, Gabriel. Lots of people appeared in that thing, and if they appear in my page, it's fair to think I might appear in theirs.

How many times have I seen somebody and not being noticed. Did Monica see me that day I was wearing a dress?

How many times have I been seen and not realized it? Maybe right now Jessica is asking my mom about the pictures where it looks like I'm wearing make up, or the facebook page with the Sofia Fernandez name.

I should be doing the exercise. Yesterday I skipped becuase I walked. Today I did not. I have no excuse today.

I took the clothes and put them in the closet. I locked the door and spread the dresses over my bed. First I wore the white blouse I bought for under the dress. I wore it and took a picture of Catherine. I saw myself in it, my body looked boxy. I did not look like a girl, well, yeah, but not really. I have not shaved and am not wearing any make up, my hair is a little messy and I feel bloated. I took the picture anyway and saved it.

In the tv, before we left in the morning, was the show of stephen colbert. The guest was the drag queen Ru Paul. I didn't know and asked who it was. My father rewinded it so we could see his welcome. I regretted it as soon as it happened. They talked about drag and coming out and he was talking about this thing that might appear have a relationship with me but they're totally different.

I felt, I don't know...

I wore the blouse and the shorts I bought. The thing that supposedly tie around my waist made me feel as a crossdressing man. I have no waist. I have no curves. There was un-stretched excess of material in the "curvy" shorts were my hips should be.

I feel dysphoric. I don't like the term but that's what I feel and tried to describe when I talked with Catherine about how I felt as if I didn't belong when I saw the clothes. How the image of them never fitting my body crossed my mind and brought me pain.

Lastly I worn the blue dress. I saw myself in it and was a little unnerved when I could not accommodate the plights of the skirt. I could not find a pose for my body to rest as the picture was taken.

There was difficulty in every attire of clothes when I tried to take them off. It exacerbates the sensation that they don't fit, that my body is huge.

Ru Paul kept referring in the feminine. Why would he go to the gynecologist? He's a drag queen, he's a gay male who dresses "in drag", as he himself describes it, to perform a show. He's not a woman. He doesn't feel or sees himself as one. He just dresses as one, disguises himself as one. He uses his femininity and wears it as a costume.

I felt similar with the snaps of jhonny. He said "cansada time", he was tired of looking "bonita". Why kept he using feminine words? He's a man. Does he sees me like that? Like a man playing a woman? Like a man playing?

I told Catherine I disliked the idea of them using the look of a woman as a disguise. But isn't that what I'm doing as well?

"Drag queens perform their shows and they took their dresses off and lived their lives again as men. Transgender women, never stop being women."

I do, I, as well, perform my show and took the clothes and make up off and live my life again as a man. I wear the clothes as a disguise, I hide. I am ashamed.

I am not a drag queen. It's not that I am not trans either.

I'm just a coward.

### 2016-06-26

Why am I feeling like crap? I did it, I went to the United States and bought all those clothes. I tried them on yesterday and I didn't look awful. They fit, I guess.

Why am I this tired? I continued the hormones again. They are supposed to lift my mood and give me energy. Today I woke up near 6 in the morning. I fell asleep hours after Catherine. I'm exhausted. I got up to eat breakfast and returned to bed. I slept all the way until the first hour of the afternoon.

I haven't finished the damn report. I didn't send the text message to Liliana to schedule the meeting. I haven't done nothing at all. Yesterday I saw myself in the mirror and saw my face changed. It has been changing, the cheeks are fuller and the lower side is narrower. The skin is thinner, too.

Even after two days of no shaving, there are traces of femininity in it.

Why do I feel like an abomination, then? Days keep passing by, counting on. Changes will keep coming.

Anahi told us about going out. It was yesterday, I think. I told her I did want to go. I do. I've been telling Catherine I feel like going out for a drink and having a good time. She doesn't ignore me, but I don't get an answer either.

She had said a date but I missed it. I thought it was about making plans on thin air. The second of July, this saturday. Fine, I have nothing. The days start coming until after the first week. The seventh is Luis graduation, and the next day the next appointment of laser and then the next week, pride.

Until the next month I'll see the endocrinologist.

There is no urgency. Actually, this going out will be sooner than I'd like. "What can I wear?", I asked Catherine. I expected, and actually explained myself later, just an idea of an outfit. A draft, something to later make my mind upon. She answered me almost instantly: the blue dress.

The new blue dress. I don't have shoes to wear with it. I could use the black flats. Whatever. But, really? Could I wear it?

Would she come pick me up? Would I drive? How would I left home? Would I dare to leave home with make up and a dress? I'd be seen. I haven't said anything to my brothers and told almost nothing new to my parents. Just typing this now makes my eyes tear up. As if I'd committed a huge betrayal.

So I'll have to hide again, then... Change in the car before leaving and change before entering home. Catherine asked me if I didn't want to drive. I told her I didn't mind. I actually forgot my huge discourses of how I've been hating driving lately. I know my father could offer me to drive me and pick me up. Would I let him?

What is it that I fear? Them seeing me? A comment? No, I feel my dad's reaction and worry.

"Will you go out dressed like this?" And those judgmental eyes filled with worry and shame. If he, that he's my father, sees me that way, how would other people, strangers, act around me? What will I do if I get into trouble? Maybe policemen will come and harras me because I'll look like a prostitute, I'll be seen as cross-dressing whore. Maybe the bouncers in the bars won't let me enter because of the difference in the picture of my id and name and how I'll look. Maybe people in side the bars will call me names and laugh at me, maybe drunk people will approach me and rape me or worse.

"What will I do? What am I doing? Am I really going out like that?"

"Aren't I scared or worried?" "Are you out of your mind?"

Yes. I am, I am sick and broken and damaged goods.

Why am I bawling my eyes like a little child? It hasn't even happened. I can avoid all that. He doesn't have to know.

Not yet, not now.

Nobody has to know still


Yesterday I was in Target when I saw the pages of those people. I told Catherine I would be posting the post in the next few weeks. But if I can't even start a conversation with Melissa how am I going to tell everybody?

Before that I have to tell Luis.

We both know he knows already. Why are those words stuck in my throat?

### 2016-06-27

After finishing yesterday's words I could not stop crying. The text Catherine received from me said that I had finished and was already lying in bed. I can't remember the theme of conversation. She said something, talked about something. Was it a question? I stated how I was crying. Tears kept coming and coming, sorrows getting stuck in my throat, the pain flowering from my stomach all the way to my mouth and nose and eyes. I closed my eyes, but it kept leaking, flowing out like a river falling in a waterfall.

What was it that put me in that state? Were they thoughts or feelings? Did I imagine something? I might had feared some approaching threat.

The last things I wrote about were the possible comments and warnings my dad would give me after seeing me in a dress, ready to go out saturday night.

I feel caged in my own secret. It's not home, it's not silence, it't not intolerance. What is it that keeps me trapped? Is it fear, shame?

I cried and cried. I kept crying while I copied yesterday's words to Catherine's conversation. I was turned to the wall with my eyes puffed and my cheeks red. The pillow was soaked and room darkened. The only light was from the phone turned down to the mattress and the tablet streaming music from spotify.

Did we talked about it? How I feel. I confessed how she made me feel worse when she asked me to change the subject. She apologized. It didn't matter, I said. It doesn't.

"It does matter. You matter, Sofia"

I don't feel it that way. I stated it. She answered back an hour later but I was already asleep. I saw the message at dawn, when I woke up from one of the different dreams I can't remember. In one of them I threw a kick to the wall and the pain in my toes brought me to full consciousness.

I should be finishing the report of the patients. Everything is done, I've applied the tests and interpreted them. All of them are ready. Now, it's just a matter of transcribing what is it that I found. I wanted, I've been meaning to send Liliana a text asking for a free time so we can chat. Today after returning from the dinner of Miguel I sent her the message. She saw it almost instantly but there was no answer.

I could had called her.

The report isn't done. I purposely waited until the afternoon so she would not ask me to come in an hour or two.

I'm scared of what she could tell me. I am scared of what I have to tell her besides the results of this patient. I have not seen her in weeks. Will she notice the changes?

She has to know. I will tell her, I can't wait any longer.

Catherine came today. She left home a little later than she had planned. Her grandpa has not returned since yesterday. He's lost. He did not come back from work. Even now, they still have no news of him.

He passed to the wings place and ordered some. I made french fries and boneless and even made some of my own spread similar to the one in In N Out.

We watched the final episode of Game of Thrones while we ate the food. I knew we would do something to celebrate Miguel's birthday. I did not congratulate him. I did not buy him a gift or made anything to him.

Not even a happy birthday.

He got home while I was doing my hair. I decided to wear something feminine. Woman's jeans and a blouse. On top I wore a shirt to cover the outline of the bra. When I exit to receive her she saw me. I asked her, but she told me I looked like a girl. I did not mind. I wanted to, I wanted to seem feminine when my parents come home, I wanted to be seen, noted. I wanted to say about this saturday. I'll be out. I don't know what I will wear. I want to wear a dress.

I want to. Why does it feel even weird to type it? It's nothing to be ashamed of. I am a woman. I am trans. I look like a woman. Women wear dresses. I bought it, it's mine. I should be able to wear it and be outside in it.

Why do I still have the need to hide it.

Catherine helped me to select even more clothes to get rid of. I filled a black bag. Some of them I gave to Luis. I could tell my mother about it tomorrow. Get the subject out.

"I took a lot of clothes out of my closet. Some they don't fit anymore, and some I don't like. They're too manly." Maybe she can ask about the clothes, the changes, the hormones.

Yeah, I've been changing. I've been going outside in female attires and being seen as a girl. And I like it, I feel at home.

Not like here, where I have to hide in my own secret.

### 2016-06-28

Little things do I hate more than having the hiccups.

I did today's and yesterday's exercise. I finished the report. I did the first half of the results lying one the couch watching the movie of Big Hero 6. The second I finished it here in my desk. Miguel arrived after noon. It was maybe 2 or 3. I disconnected the printer to connect my laptop. He was lying in the whole couch asleep.

I had to stop writing because of those damn hiccups. The jumping make my hands miss the keys.

I did the exercise early today, the amount of two days. I sweated and went to shower. In the morning after eating breakfast and taking the pills I went to my mother's restroom. I looked at my reflection and saw my face. The skin is noticeably clearer. There are changes from before. Even in the pictures of yesterday, where I don't I even like how I looked, my face looks different. The chin is less pronounced and my cheeks are fuller.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. What happened this week? I went to the united states and bought clothes. I used the dressing rooms and bought dresses. I wore the gray and black one. I tried several in different stores. I spent most of my money. I have the attire I can wear in the pride Parade.

Anahi invited us to the party, this saturday. I talked with Catherine about going or not. I can see myself wearing something different. Now it's not so far away the idea of really going to the graduation dresses as a girl. It's two whole months and spare days until the day come. By then Luis and Miguel have to know about me. After them knowing, after everyone in this house seeing me I will post the Update.

What is it that keeps me from talking with Luis? We don't talk seriously. We joke and share insults and memes. With Miguel is even less than that. Could I tell Miguel first? Just even thinking about it makes me nervous. It's not him knowing or his reaction or what he would think or feel. It's opening up, saying it. Talking.

I'm sure Luis has noticed more, maybe suspects or knows more.

It doesn't matter. This week I don't think they'll know.

I had thought about telling my mom about the clothes I took out. Did I saw her? She arrived with Luis. She asked me why Luis thought my grandma had come. That was the conversation we had.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. I sent him the text message asking him for the time. I referred myself as Sofi. A little later I sent another to Liliana asking her if I could see he tomorrow. Her son answered me telling me she would call me when she gets up.

I haven't received anything new.

Tomorrow I'll dress even more feminine. I'll wear the shorts I bought and a t-shirt with a long neck.

I almost weighted myself today. I had made the exercise. No, I've done just half of it. I stepped with one foot on the scale and saw the numbers fluctuate. Yesterday I did nothing. I went to bed without finishing the report nor doing the exercise. Catherine felt bad, tired, nauseous. Today when she was showering she felt lightheaded and had to get out of the shower.

Her grandfather came up today. They did took them after going out to party. Everything is fine.

What am I nervous about? Seeing Liliana, telling her about me. She knows, probably more than Luis but possibly not much. Even then opening up and telling about the name and saying it and asking for her help makes me feel uneasy. Besides it, facing the client doesn't make me feel as stressed. That was it. The test, the results. I graded it after seeing him. I could had used his counsel.

This thursday probably I won't see her. The next one will be Luis' graduation, and Friday will be the laser session. This saturday will be the meeting, going out. Will I dare going out and be seen by my parents? Why am I scared and nervous? Is it the comments, their eyes, their faces? Do I mind the thinks they will say, to my face or my back? Or are more the things I will see? Maybe is their thoughts and feelings. Those I can't change nor control. They feel it anyway sooner or later. There is no difference if they see me this saturday or next week or next month.

It doesn't matter if the've known for a week or a year. The impact of seeing me different, changed, will be the same.

I avoided the mirror for months. What did I think and feel when I finally dared to see?

### 2016-06-29

I know I dreamed something today. I had to wake up so I could go to the bathroom. I was in a movie theater. The halls were full, and showing different movies. Was I with my family or alone? No, I was with some people. The whole day I hadn't thought about it. I was running down the flights of stairs. I got into a bathroom. I stood in front of the urinal, the flyer of my pants open. Did I think about which one to use? Did I consider the clothes I was wearing or how I was presenting?

I woke up and went straight for the bathroom. People stop wetting the bed in their early years. I've never told Rene how I never really stopped. There were always single moments after they had ended. Almost routinely every two or three years. I remember being in jr high, being in highschool. Was I once even in college?

It never occurred to me to think about the context of those situations. They were always accidents. One dream, I try holding it in but woke up with the pajamas wet and warm. It was shameful and embarrassing. It was not a call for attention or help, it was not regression.

For a time I actually thought there was something wrong with me. I developed the habit of trying to go to the restroom just moments before falling asleep.

I was woken up today by my mother but not in the usual way. My cellphone started ringing and I picked it up. I didn't think it would be Liliana, I didn't think it would be anyone specifically. It was her, she asked if I would go out today. I answered yes but didn't say where. When? I answered. She forgot her purse. She told me why it was important of her to have it as if she needed to give me a reason to ask for a favor.

I could take it to her. Just before therapy. I did.

I showered and shaved and shaved and combed my hair with my fingers and put sunscreen and make up and tied my shoes. I looked very feminine. I liked it. I didn't care.

I drove to her school. I parked in a second lane and got of the car with two purses. Her and mine. I wore sunglasses but my lips were red. The shorts covered most of my thighs but my calves were bare and smooth. Did anyone see me enter? I walked towards her classroom. She was outside surrounded by her class moms. She approached me and her eyes were open. For a second they were wide. As if she was surprised. Was it because she recognized me out of the blue? Wasn't she expecting me? Was she expecting me looking different?

There were no comments or exchanged words. Neither of us said anything. "I have to go" I really had. I drove towards therapy.

I sent snapshots to Eusebio and Jhonny. I saved two of them. Jhonny asked me if I had nothing to do while I waited. I could try painting my nails.

There was a message in my phone that caught me by surprise. It was Johanna. Two of them. She apologized for not answering before. That was the only thing I saw before the next one came in a second notification. How am I doing, how's life lately?. I swiped the notification to get it out view. It scared me. I thought and made peace with her rejecting me, forgetting me.

I mentioned it to Rene after talking about my patient and Catherine's parents' wedding and jhonny's graduation and this saturday's dressing situation. Catherine told me to see it, read it before I entered with Rene. I did. The message was longer than I had thought. In it she mentioned what I said before. She's happy for me, if it makes me happy, she's impressed with what I've accomplished.

Why do those words mean nothing for me no more?

It's supposed to be better to have less rejecting people. It's absurd to be disappointed that the number in the people who gave up on me shrank.

My eyes teared up in this subject. I related Johanna with Monica. Both of them were my friends, closer than most people in times I was alone. Both of them ended up in silence. And then she came back out of it, she's happy for me, she continued the conversation, she cares.

And the other one...

The other one will always be gone.

She's the only one who have rejected me. Why does that hurt more than having several people denying me?

### 2016-06-30

I'm not out of home. I didn't get out of the city or went to an amusement park. I'm here, I'm in my room. I'll type them here in the phone. The lights are out, but the sun still illuminates the room besides mine. The tablet is playing a son of the son of John Lennon.

I am sad, I am tired. The whole day I spent it crying. Last night the conversation with the three of us in whatsapp dealt with this Saturday. I have less money than I thought. I ought to put gas. I won't be able to leave the house wearing the dress. I'll hide again and change outside home because I'm so coward I don't dare to show my parents what they already know. I won't be able to drink. There was no point in me even going. Yesterday the conversation with Catherine ended when she asked me how I was and if I wanted to talk. It wasn't that I didn't. So I stayed awake a couple of hours still.

This morning I put the clothes out which I was going to wear. I tried the blouse after showering. I didn't like it. I didn't like how I looked. I hate how I look.

I changed a couple of times and ended ironing one of the new ones. I wore that one. It wasn't that I liked it more. I just hated it less. I hadn't worn it before.

Catherine, before me getting out of bed sent me a text telling me that jhonny had just said that he had a meeting, so we could see us an hour later. She'd pick me up a third after two.

She was late. She told me how she was leaving home. She got stuck in traffic, and missed the exit and then a red light. The last message said that she was already late so she'd buy gas.

"it doesn't matter, you're almost always late"

A little after she sent me a text message saying that she was here, and an audio asking me to be walking outside. She was angry, no, she was upset. She asked me why the text. Why did I say that? To tell her something, say something. I stayed quiet, silent. My mouth was shut. I apologized but she insisted, she asked again and her eyes got misty, her lips started trembling. I put my head on her arm. I wasn't consolling her. I wanted to hide. I was ashamed.

Shame. Will I ever stop being ashamed?

That was how we met today. She stopped for gas and the whole trip there was silent. I kept crying a little, trying to hold the tears. In the parking of the cafÃƒÂ©, I couldn't kept them in. The whole ball of emotions escaped my hands,and rolled and rolled and became this huge thing that was unstoppable and uncontrollable.

We stayed there until jhonny arrived. I kept letting it out. Talking about what I can't remember. No. I was silent. I said nothing and cried all.

We got out and she ordered. I asked for nothing. She offered me some of her chips but I declined. I don't deserve food. I want to starve until I shrink and become invisible.

He talked with us about Miguel, what happened, his job, stuff.

I tried to smile. I could for a while. Did he see the tearmarks on my cheeks or the redness of my eyes? No, of course not. Nobody notices anything.

We talked about where could we go next. A park, maybe. The beach still? She decided to go to the one in front of the Mexico Institute. I said nothing about it, and even I offered the Hacienda one.

We ended up on Playas. She parked near the park in front of the beach. We got out of the car and started walking towards the beach. I saw a black pick up getting out. I was going to joke it was my dad just before I started considering. I saw the model, the color, the shade of the man driving it.

I turned so he would not be able to see me. And it hurt me, the action, the shame. We were just talking about him.

I talked about something before jhonny. She told me about Anahi and how she reacted after my message.

"Don't get angry at me", she told me after I answered. Near the beach we sat and I continued crying and talking. The conversation was the same, this Saturday the options we had, what we could do.

Uber, Anahi's brother, my changing at her place. Those do nothing with my problem. I'll still be hiding, I'll still be a coward.

I'll never stop being Ivan the cowardly boy.

Las time I wrote here it didn't saved. I hope this won't be like that.


### 2016-07-01

I didn't realize a new month had just begun.

In the morning I woke up after last night filled with sorrow and tiredness. I slept an hour after finishing the words and woke up an hour shy of midnight. There was a message in the screen of my phone. "Aay, you really are such a woman n.n", said jhonny. Did I open it or was it just the notification?

I know there was no obvious emotion that surfaced. A smile appeared on my face and the huge and dark cloud of sadness became lighter.

A woman. such a woman. He was surprised, like, amazed. I felt validated. He saw me with eyes teary and puffy and my the tears barely dry on my cheeks.

So I fell asleep. Today I would have to say to my parents about tomorrow's plans. I'm still stressed about that. How will I leave home? It's all set with Anahi and his brother. He can take us to our homes for 100 pesos. My trip home is done. But how will I get there? Today was it, I think, when Catherine told me she could order a uber for getting to the plaza and picking me up here. Sure, that's another solution. And yet, the main problems stays unsolved. I will have to change here, I will have to get dressed and made up and stand in the living room and call my leaving and seeing them to their faces.

Am I scared of their eyes? Am I scared of their emotions and thoughts or am I scared of their words?

For months I've been scared of Luis reaction, his answer.

He came just a little after I woke up to tell my, ask me if I could pick him up from school at 1 o'clock. The whole morning I stayed doing nothing. I took up and went to the living room. I guess I watched some tv. I haven't picked up the book. I actually liked it, why haven't I returned?

I made breakfast for myself. The english muffins I bought were supposed to be eaten before Miguel's birthday. The house was alone. I found a thin black belt that I could wear with the dress instead of the black one.

Now in the afternoon, after my parents came from taking Miguel to the billiards and bringing food. My mother asked something about the dishes. Why haven't anyone done them. I said that I did them the last time. She took it as if I said it was her turn. "What is it that you've done all week?... You are not doing anything. I am working the whole day, it's so tiring because these days" bla bla bla. I was hurt. I wanted to say something about tomorrow and after that I kept my mouth shut. She hit Luis in the back and he said it hurt. She kept at it and joked that she was giving him a massage, like denying guilt, acting playfully. Luis kept on explaining something about a bone or something, and she started saying how delicate he was, in this loud voice as if the joke was shared. I, annoyed by the early comments, killed her playfulness:

"Don't scream, I can't hear the tv". She did shut. He face dimmed subtly into seriousness while she grab her things. She walked upstairs, and both of us, I imagine, felt shitty.

I was going to pick him up. If I leave the house tomorrow dressed, I will have to face most of them. So, everyone had to know by tomorrow. I could tell Luis in the way back after picking him up. I imagined it. Rehearsed it in my head. Played with the words and arranged them.

Later, whe sent me a text message asking if I could pick him up an hour later. Later, my dad would sent me another one telling me that Luis would ask me to drive him to a friend's house, to confirm him after I took him there and he would pick him up in the evening.

Everything was ruined. I could not say anything if I was just a ride. How would he deal with everything just before going to this other house?

I parked and entered the school asking for him. I entered and there were two men sitting in a couch just ahead of the hall. The principal faced and asked Rossy if they said that someone would pick Luis up. I had my eyes hidden in the shades. Rossy recognized my voice and told him yes.

"Yeah, his mother said his, uh... " he looked at me for a moment and then said doubtfully, "brother... would be here"

After he got into the car, I waited for him to tell me about this other house. He didn't so I asked. No, it was cancelled.

I felt this nervousness. The words getting stuck in my throat. I made the first attempt asking if he have seen me any different. It was before entering the fast lane. I didn't say anything again until we were exiting it.

"Remember how you've been asking me about trans people? I am trans myself."

"Really?"

"Yeah" "But... how?"

"I was a girl before and turned into a boy before you were born". I looked at him, but not enough to see if he believed me or not. "No, I'm joking... the other way around. I'm turning into a girl."

I explained, how I've been going to the doctor and taking blood tests and the pills I take are hormones. "But isn't the testosterone stronger?" "Yeah, but the other pills I take block it".

"Oh, it's fine." "It's ok" "I've always wanted a sister".

He took it as if I had just told him I decided to change majors.

Am I relieved? Nothing of which I feared happen. The only one in this house that doesn't know yet is Miguel.

Luis was clueless. Or at least that was he said. I asked him about the make up or the clothes. He denied noticing. The questions? It's just because they don't appear in the books. The make up? Just lipstick once...

And that was it.

He knows even more than my parents. He knows the name, he has seen pictures. He knows me now, more than my whole family. He kept being close, with me, in my room, playing and joking as if nothing had happened.

There is still tomorrow to deal with.


## July, 2016

### 2016-07-02

The tickers for Pride in two weeks are now printed. They were the first impressions of the new printer that just came up in the mail. Finally Miguel accused me of being the one who disconnected the other printer and making it break again. He said in the Denny's dinner when they were talking about Luis. "Who are you saying disconnected it? It wasn't him. It was Ivan."

Nobody said anything else.

We were to the United States. We've return. Now Catherine might be getting ready. I should be doing the same. In two hours she will be on the way to pick me up. I was supposed to tell my parents, tell them ahead, give them notice, that I would be leaving the house in a dress, I'd be going outside in femme mode, I would be out at night as a woman.

I'm scared, I'm nervous, I feel guilty and ashamed. I didn't tell them. I don't know if I will.

Fortunately the living room is empty. There is just Luis in there with his ipad. My dad is shoeless lying n bed watching his shows. My mother will stay in her desk working on the countless things she has to do. Miguel might come down or stay in his room.

If everything keeps itself the way it is, I might be ok.

If not, the most probable thing is I'll be seen. I might be questioned, they might be stunned or surprised. Is that the way it should be done? It's nothing wrong. I'm not doing something forbidden. I'm in all my rights of leaving the house how I please. I should not be worrying about telling them, asking for their permission. Even in Denny's in a silly attempt of getting the conversation flowing I told them Catherine would be picking me up by 8. My mother asked if today and kept her sight on me. My dad asked her why, what was she going to say? Nothing, it was the way I said it, as if I were asking for her permission or acceptance.

Then they're not expecting me of saying anything.

We picked the printer and ate breakfast. We went to a store for my mother to find clothes for her ceremony of closure. I tried, I actually tried going around looking at the clothes, just wandering. It was uncomfortable, I had this idea in my head of what I should be telling them, and I was afraid of them noticing my anxiety, what was I hiding? Why was I shaking and distant and quiet?

I couldn't. My mother looked for shoes. And I wandered, too. I looked at the flats and the boots. They were expensive, more than I'd be even capable of asking for. I found it hard for asking my dad for the 3o dollars of the payless shoes' flats.

After leaving the mall, we stopped in Best Buy. The were going to look for the printer cartridges and Luis wanted a cable.

Luis. He's the only one who knows I'll be leaving in a dress today. He saw the picture. "Will you be wearing the black?"

I'm not scared of standing in front of me and asking him to tell my parents I left.

I would even do it in front of Miguel. Miguel, who does not know.

Why did I leave him for last?

Was it in the dinner? Yeah, it was. It was before of the printer thing. I told them nonchalantly how I have lost the strength of my upper body. "I've no longer strength in my arms" "which one?", asked my mom. I replied that both of them and told her how I could not carry the printer in the mail and was tired of just lifting it from the carton box.

My father looked straight at me and intervened: "Why?"

I saw directly to his eyes when I answered: "it's because of the pills"

Just that sentence, that was enough for everyone to understand. He closed his mouth and his eyes and shook his head slowly, dripping disappointment. I felt like crying. No, I was upset. I felt a little anger. I'm opening up. I'm telling you, sharing. You're dismissive. How do you want me to come to you? How do you forbid me to claim I'm alone?

Before entering the best buy I went my own way to the payless shoes. I entered and went directly to that part. I tried a couple of them. The clerk passed besides me and said hi.

I left without buying anything, he said good bye.

When we were to target, I asked my dad for 30 dollars to go to the store while they were in Target. He acceded and gave me two 20 bills.

I went and tried them again, although I've done it countless times.

I bought them. The lady asked nothing and said nothing. She smiled and was kind. I did it. I did not tell anyone.

And here I am, typing although I've gotten to the goal. I'm scared of getting ready, I'm scared of going upstairs, and leaving.

I am afraid and scared.



### 2016-07-03

Yesterday I could leave the room. I heard steps and the sound of the microwave. My father was downstairs. Someone was playing Xbox, I thought it was Miguel, but later heard their voices. Catherine had left her home, she was on her way. I waited for my father to go upstairs, to leave. I could just tell Luis that I'd be leaving and to tell my parents I was gone.

It never happened. She was closer and closer. She got to the 5&10, she was in the bridge. I had to leave it. I was wearing the dress with the black long sweater over it, the brown shoes barely covered my feet, the rest of my legs were bare to the end of the skirt. My face was pale and my lips were red. The purse was hanging from my shoulder and the keys jingled in my hand with every step.

It was time. My heart was racing. I had to do it, so I did it. I opened the door and saw him sitting in the table. Luis was in the couch with the controller in his hands. I didn't stop from my door to the front one. His eyes met mine on the way but his expression stayed the same. "Have they come to pick you up?" "Yeah, they're here", I mumbled with the words as nervously as I kept walking.

"Bye, Ivan", said Luis even though he knows now my name. I didn't mind. My father doesn't. I don't think he does.

After exiting the door, I was relieved. It was no more than 3 minutes what I waited before I saw the lights from the Jetta that picked me up. I sat in the back seat with Catherine and explained what had happened with my father and Luis, and how I had told him and bought my shoes. She started telling me about the conversation with Andie. She knows now. I added her on Facebook and started a conversation.

We talked in the morning and later now in the afternoon. I spent most of the evening talking with Melissa. She knows, too.

We started talking about her job and service, her work with her patients and all that. After that, she asked me about my life, outside of the work things. And I took the opportunity. I am trans, and kept explaining. She had seen the profile. She remembered I had no sisters. I never spoke about one. She put two and two together. It made sense. She took my offer of asking any questions and we talked about lots of things. She disclosed me some intimate things, too. She's never had a relationship, she's never had sex either. She doubted of her sexuality for a while.

"The curious thing is that you look good as a woman and as a man. I commented it to Anna, and she knew it, too. (It was the same way.)

So now two more people, know. Three if I count Anna. I sent a friend request to Johanna, another to Anna. I considered sending them to all the people who know about me. It was the starting idea. I could add Garab, too. I stopped it there. I thought about the other people that were missing. Luis, my parents, Monica.

Do I want to add her? Do I want her to accept me or not?

I stopped.

In the other profile, I added Zayra and Maru. One of them accepted me already. I want them to know my change. I want them to hear my news. Every person I've told has received the news cordially and amicable. Everyone has been nice and supportive. All but one. She was the first to know, it wasn't immediately. It took time. She loved me, more than anyone but Catherine. Maybe that's another factor.

All but Miguel knows in my house. Just Luis knows my name. If they know will I ask them to change the way the call me? Do I want them to?

My father said nothing, is he denying it? He's not making any comments, it was as if nothing had happened. Did he see me? Did he tell my mother?

I have the message ready to send to Miguel. It's fine that I send one. I don't dare to do it in person. Lots of people have seen the profile. The list of suggested people has grown. Now there's Monica and him. There is Medrano and Consuela. There are a lot of new faces.

When I was a child I discovered something that seems simple and obvious enough but to my it was a profound and significative learning. If I'm seeing somebody, it's almost sure that they can see me back, too.

I'll send it to him.

### 2016-07-04

My head hurts. Luis is right besides me talking. He is talking with me. Miguel is in the dinning room watching the Captain America movie that I was watching. Why do I feel weird?

Yesterday I sent him the message. I was here in this room typing the words, he was outside doing his homework or something. Did I send them before or after going to bed?

Luis doesn't know. Or maybe he does.

I didn't wait to read his answer. I closed the messenger and chatted with Catherine.

Right now I can't stop, uh... what's the word for when you open your mouth and inhale profusely because of tiredness? I can't remember it. The pulsing ache in my heads is just between my eyes.

I kept looking for the little ball with his face to appear under the message signaling he had read it. I didn't stay. After a while I entered and exited. I saw it finally and closed it faster than other times. Catherine was as nervous as I, or even a little more. Was it today or yesterday when she cried because of the frustration of not being able to tell her father?

He asked her today: "Why doesn't that Ivan come anymore?" Her heart raced. She stayed silent.

Miguel did answer. It took him a couple of minutes but he answered back. I was not ready to read him. I had to wait. I fell asleep and dreamed about a school or something. There were deaths in the dream. I woke up in the early morning and read it. It was way longer than the one I sent him. He admitted to having noted it, way long before I told my parents or even started opening up. He heard about the pills, the first ones. Maybe he heard me crying or something. He mentioned the conversation I had with my mom on the table, he just overheard but caught the idea. He knew about the subject because of reddit, tumblr and the internet. My mom did talk with him. He would wait until I were ready to open up. He used a female noun to describe me in there.

He was understanding and caring and supporting. He noticed me before anyone. He said how he stills admires me and wants to be like me. I felt like crying, but I didn't.

Today I sent him a friend request. He accepted in the evening. I sent one to Luis, too, but he hasn't. I was worrying about hte reason. He mentioned it first when I talked about his ipad and why he took it from my hands. "Are you sure you want me to add you?" "Why do you ask?" "Because of what you said, that it would appear to other people"

Was he worrying about me or him?

Could I blame him?

Garab accepted the request, too. I even sent one to Enrique, Anahi's brother. I don't really expect him to accept me. I just wanted to send one to everyone who knows about me. I almost have. My mom and father are still left. And there will always be Monica. Her profile appears now in that place. She might see me, too.

"I look good as a man and a woman" "You do are such a woman"

Why can't I believe it?

When I talked with Melissa yesterday, she confessed how she still saw me as a man, as the man she knew.

It hurt. Of course it did. I am not one. That I have never had difficulty accepting. But I told her something I never claimed before. I am a woman. I feel like one. I don't identify as one, I am one.

Inside, outside?

I was not once misgendered leaving home saturday night. Everyone treated me as a girl. I looked like one. Even Anahi's mother in the way Anahi told us, asked her if we hug... as girlfriends.

We are girlfriends. We are a lesbian couple. We're two women who love each other.

How can I convince every one if I don't really believe it myself. If I'm not really a woman, then what am I?

I thought about posting the status, the information, saying out loud to anyone who might hear. My grandmother came today. She rang the doorbell and hugged me.

Will I tell her? Am I scared of her reaction? She might be understanding, she might not.

I won't hide from her. I won't hide anymore. Not in this house, not this wednesday.


### 2016-07-05

"Can I call you Luis-broad?"
"No, can I call you Ivan-belly?" "No" "...Sofia-belly?"

It wasn't uncomfortable or awkward. It was unexpected. His words had meaning and I comprehended them, and yet my mind stayed blank for a second. The silence came and he talked again.

My grandmother gave the rings to show Catherine. One is black with silver and the other has the colors swapped. They are not ugly. I showed them to her. I put on the crimson pants and went to her. I asked her if she could slim them a little. She did, they're fine. They're not as tapered as I asked her, but it's better this way. They're ready. Just before my mother arrived and took her to the bus central. She will return to Mexicali and attend the graduation of my cousins. After that, this Thursday, I guess, will return to go to Luis' thing.

I've already told my mother about taking Catherine. The pants are ready and I can wear them.

This friday I'll go to the laser session. Three weeks after the last one. I believe I have two paid ones left. This one and the one in august. She didn't ask me last time about doing it when. This week I'll be very clear about being four weeks apart.

Next week will be Pride parade. A year from the first time I wore the clothes outside.

Luis knows, Miguel knows. My father has seen me in the dress and my mother asked me again about the effects I've experienced.

Now that my grandma is gone, everyone in this house knows about me. Two of them know my name. Maybe my parents have seen the Facebook profile, too. Maybe.

I feel the urge to post it. Post the thing and go public. See the number of friends grow. Accepting people, people who know, who've seen me.

I remember when I could count the contacts with the numbers on my hands. Now it's 20. 20 people.

I had to cancel the request to Luis and Anahi's brother. I couldn't deal with the waiting. Even the Zayra one in the other profile makes me uncomfortable. I wanted her to know. I wanted her to see the changes I've gone through. Did I wrote it in the mails I sent her? The biographies of both Psychotherapy and Tanathology.

There is another urge that I don't dare to mention with Catherine. I added Luis and Enrique because both of them knew about me. There was that other person. Why do I feel the need to send the request? It's not that I really want her friendship. I want her to see me. I want her to see the name and recognize the history. I met her and told her she looked like her. At the beginning she feared that she would never be able to live to Sofia's standards, to fulfill her role, fill her shoes.

How ironic and tragic that she was right.

I want her to see the picture and see the other ones and notice how I've changed. I want her to think that I am almost unrecognizable, that I am nothing like the man everyone thought I was.

I don't have to add every person who knows about me. Vania, the friend of Catherine's she met today, knows me, too. I didn't think about adding her. My parents stay unconnected from this new profile. They haven't even heard the name.

Vania asked about me, why Sofia?

"Oh yeah, it's that she knew, even though she heard a thousand names, she was and is Sofia"

New people referring to me in the feminine. Her, Andrea, Melissa. Even Melissa who admitted she keeps seeing me as the man she met and knew. It's the complete opposite of what I believed. I didn't want their tries, I wanted the real and honest thoughts. Why do they make me smile?

Luis used my name and Miguel referred to me in the feminine in his answer.

He hesitated when saying my name when he rattled about me disconnecting the printer. He didn't say "he", he stopped and then pronounced Ivan.

No, I'm looking way too much into it.

I don't think I'll add Monica.

But probably I will post the message in Facebook tomorrow. I'll wait until after the session and talking with Rene about it.

Yeah, there was no point in making it public what was the necessity of screaming it to the world?

The three or four people that now know me since last week besides my brother had already seen the profile and recognize me through it. Lots of people must have seen it, too.

I can just admit it and prove to myself I am not ashamed anymore.

### 2016-07-06

I spent the night with her, like before. The guilt of a forbidden relationship was with me when we drove the school. We met Catherine. The class started and shit happened. We met outside and drove again, this time the three of us in the same car. We stopped outside my old house in Otay. She had vomit on her mouth and was unconscious. I wanted to wake her up so I called her name. "Mona" I said, "Mona"... But she wasn't Monica, she was Xennia.

In the house my father received us Luis and Miguel way younger than they are before. I knew I was in a dream and realized the unfamiliarity and nostalgia that seeing that place again woke up in me. When I saw the differences in everywhere and the animals I decided to wake up.

I got up from bed early in the morning. I heard my mother leave the house. I ate breakfast. Did I cook something or was it a bowl of cereal? None. I made myself a sandwich. It was more than I wanted and yet I finished. I didn't eat again until late in the afternoon when my mom came back with Chinese food from the River Plaza.

I showered and changed for therapy. I had no reason to hide anymore. I put on woman's jeans and a girl's blouse. I applied make up and thought I looked fine. The sunscreen burned the skin around my nose. Is it the changes in my skin, is it burn because of the sun or a reaction from the make up? I know there are changes, but why can't I see them?

I keep looking at the pictures of this saturday. There is a video where I am making faces at the camera besides Catherine. My face looks fine, my shoulders seem pale in the contrast with the fabric of the dress, the width of it makes them seem not as broad. We smile while this song plays in the background. The video lasts less than 5 seconds.

There are not many photos of me and I don't like most of them.

I left home an hour early because of the traffic. I was wearing a brown and loose shirt of Miguel. I parked where I usually do, in front of the elementary school where some girls saw me and Catherine walking from the Alitas restaurant and called us to say to the camera. It was empty again. I walked confidently. I don't feel nervous anymore. I was wearing the brown flats I bought last week.

When I passed the little cart that sells fruit and beverages he called to me "What can I offer you, [male] friend?". It was like a stab in the gut. I kept walking ignoring him. The reflection from the mirror in the building caught my attention and tried to console me as if it were saying: "look at me, look, you look fine".

I kept walking but my confidence stayed with the dirty fruits and melted ice.

In therapy I talked about last week. It started with the traffic and the closure of roads. Then I started with the lack of comments from my mother seeing me in her school. Luis and Miguel know about me and I narrated how I told them. Saturday I tried to tell both of my parents I intended to wear a dress. I wore it and my father saw me. I talked about Monica and why I feel the obsession of sending the friend request as if I want her to see me and notice how I have changed.

I talked about Catherine and how it hurts she hasn't changed. Ivan is still her boyfriend and her father waits for him. I want to publish the notice of my changes. I want to tell all my contacts that Ivan is gone, that I'm not him, I'm me. I want them to know I'm not the same, I'm not who they think. I want them to forget I ever was like that. I want them to come and accept me, to see their support and stop feeling alone.

Rene didn't say anything but I could sense he's not a fan of the idea. Earlier sessions he has made the comment about the difficulties I'll face and I should not rush into things. But it hurst being hidden. It's excruciating knowing I'm in the mouths of others, they see me in a dress but they see him and talk of him and miss him.

Who cares about me?

I feel full, my stomach is filled with food. I ate the sandwich in the friday's, the restaurant that my family always chooses. Outside my room is my mother making a preachment about why she wants Luis to read his speech for her so she can record him and post it on Facebook. I, in his place, would hate that. I would hate my grandmother making the same questions over and over: "did you threw the paper of the speech? Did you? Uh? Did you threw it, son? Huh?"

Anyway, I am not in his place. I passed all that. My childhood is over. I'm no longer a child, a boy. Am I a woman, now? Was I ever a man?

The music is playing from the speakers. After finishing the words I'll change clothes and try doing the exercise. Today the cycles are shorter, but they're three now.

It was Luis graduation. Since long before today I knew I'd wear man's clothes. The plan was that I'd pick Catherine a little before 3 and we would meet them later in the school. It was all set. I was upset about the clothes I would wear. I hate them. I hate the idea of being seen as a man. I feel them like a disguise. I look disguised wearing something else.

Before showering and dressing myself, I asked my mother about what would happen today. She was getting ready for going to school. "At what time will you leave?" "After four" "How will you do it with Luis and everyone?" "I guess they will go with you"

Nobody said anything to me. I would have to accommodate myself to their plans. I was angry. I let it go.

In the restaurant she was saying something to my grandmother. Something about someone being un a bad mood. I asked about who. They didn't answer and made me realize I was the subject of their conversation. She started talking about today how I answered angrily to her when she asked me to take them. I couldn't take it. I opened up and told her my mind. I explained she didn't ask me but told me. It was because I asked her directly, had I not come to her, I would never knew.

I feel the waist of the pants constricting my stomach. I can hear my mother words to Luis behind the camera.

He won first prize from his group in both his normal classes and english class. He is the smartest one in there. He's like me, I'm proud.

"Tell me what are you expressing".


What is it that makes me mad about my mother's pictures? I know it's seeing myself in there, I know it's my grandmothers annoying insistence. But the artificiality of it. Repeating something for a fake memory. Seeing the set up for a void picture or video. I don't mind anybody taking pictures spontaneously about the things I do or happen. Is the asking me to repeat them, to fake them. The music the white paper behind, they insisting so they can share it to people who don't care.

I told Catherine I had the idea of changing therapists. No, it wasn't changing what I thought. It was leaving him. The reason I told her was that his doubts are worse than mine. "It will be hard, it will be complicated. I've told you. Don't rush things"

I had the initiative, the idea. I wanted to open up and tell everybody. He looked at me with a face of doubt and uncertainty. The worse could happen out of it. I need help and support. His doubts are not even free. Why should I pay somebody for having worse expectations than me? He gives me the idea of reluctancy out of my transition. Am I projecting my own uncertainty and doubts into him?

I don't want to go back to how I looked. The changes are minimal and barely noticeable to others beside me, and yet thinking about suspending the hormones and going back makes me afraid.

Everybody but my grandma knows. Everybody keeps calling me and referring me in the same way. I want to change this situation and then I think about telling everybody else.

I asked Catherine about what would she do in my place. She told me the same thing. She'd do it. Maybe she would say something before to her family.

After two or three takes, my mother is still angry. She tells him to go. I want to stand up and tell them to shut up. It's his right. I would not want it anyway.

Go fuck yourselves.



### 2016-07-08

A white sheet was floating in front of the open window. An illusion made by the current of wind, I thought. Its moves were elegant and rhythmic. It floated there, dancing in the empty air. A musical ghost. It died and fell to the floor as if someone had flicked the switch cutting its life support. The air must had stopped. Suddenly it revived and kept dancing a little far from its starting position. It moved faster and more energetic. The distance between us was getting shorter. It wasn't the air.

In another scene I remembered reading my mother's notes about the incident. As if I were her subject of study she narrated my reaction and behavior upon the sheets dancing, death and resurrection. She narrated in the feminine, though.

Another different scene after that one we were in the same room, sharing the same bed. I was lying with my head upon her lap. Her fingers caressed softly the insides of my curls. A soft voice sang to me in a musicality completely unfamiliar to my past. Her words were those of a lullaby sang filled with love from a mother's care to her daughter.

When I woke up I wasn't happy nor satisfied nor content. It wasn't love I felt nor care. Not even unreal or fantastic. I felt sorrow. Misery brought to me from my own unconscious desires and lacks.

I drove Luis to his school, his last party or reunion or whatever it was. He knows about me and that just makes it worse. Every Ivan burns as those scorching pinpricks of laser that make me flinch when the laser hits my face.

Today was the fourth session. After leaving him in school I drove myself to the place. In there, an unknown girl welcomed me. She didn't say nothing about the sunscreen nor my time from shaving. She told me I had finished with my paid sessions but I stayed quiet. This time was even shorter. I had forgotten to take the ibuprofen to mute the penetrating pulses of pain. It's supposed to be lower every session. The one before it's the one that has hurt the most. She warned me with an explanation that if I felt hotter or a little more painful it was because she upped the intensity so it would be quicker and more effective.

This time the machine don't stop a single time. It was a continue set of flashes and light and pain. It was over before I realized. The redness and swelling was more noticeable than other times, although it faded mostly by the time I got home. Miguel was already there. When we were eating he made some comments and jokes. It was like a try of getting closer, reaching for me.

Why do I feel the most distant I've ever felt to everybody?

I have this dark somberness inside of me. An ill mood that makes me just wish to crawl to bed and turn off al lights. I have things to wait for. Next week will be the pride parade. After that, 2 weeks later I'll be in another session of laser and then two after that I'll see the endocrinologist.

And then, just more waiting. Waiting to talk with my family, waiting to dare to send the message to Liliana, waiting for the medicines to bring me more obvious changes, waiting to reconcile with the reflection of the mirror, waiting for time to pass by and let me escape and be free.

I've run out of words and things to say and the counter is still low. I'm tired. I weighted more than the initial weight I had in the first session with the endocrinologist. I did the exercises of today. I did yesterday's after Luis' dinner in the Friday's.

My grandma called me daughter when she asked about my mom. She corrected herself almost instantly. She messes our names all the time, that she was thinking about my mother must not mean anything.

She hasn't returned from her school. After her turns she went to a meeting or reunion or party of hers. This one is in the house of her old principal.

50 more words and I can finish. I have no plans for the weekend. I should not waste money. I should keep it safe and unspent. I'll need it this weekend. Will my grandmother stay here? Has she noticed me?

Catherine told me today my ill sentiments towards her are obvious. Has she noted them?

Do I push her away from the fear of telling her and being rejected?

Is that what I do with everyone?

### 2016-07-09

I just ate and have no energy for doing the exercises. It's a quarter before 8 and I'm tired. I've spent most of t the day either in bed or in the couch. I slept with both my eyes open and shut. My brain has stayed both quiet and numb.

I read another chapter of the book. It's interesting, I like it. It's not enough to caught my attention. I watched a couple of episodes of the police show in Netflix but it's just white noise that helps me pass the time.

I think about tomorrow and next week. Another week that passed without news of Liliana. A therapy session that made me feel worse than when it started. A fourth laser session. The black spots are minimal. Three weeks after the last one. I hope it's effective.

Just after finishing this words I might try to do the exercise, from there I'll go to bed again, try to sleep.

Why do I want to sleep? Is it tiredness? Maybe it's just a wish for time to pass. I can't wait until I have something to do. I can't look for a job. I can, I don't want to. It's not that I don't want to work. I want to, I want to do something with my time. I don't want to send resumes with a picture of me and the name I don't want anyone to remember. How can I go to a interview dressed in a disguise hoping to be hired and asked to cut my hair, to wear the male uniform and meet several new people under an expedited name.

Next year I can start applying to the master. Yeah, I'll have interviews and the same resume. They'll meet me with that same old name, they'll review my application, my history. I'll have to travel again and show my id various times.

I feel hopeless and scared. I want time to pass. I wish I could change my name and papers and look normal. I wish I could be normal.

An afternoon in an androgynous attire was enough to shit on my mood.

My heart desires to escape, fly and run far away from here. Being somewhere else, someone else.

Will life be different? After I have the new name and identification and a birth certificate that corroborates my story, will things get better? Will I get a job and be able to sustain myself? When I was kid I found the idea impossible. As I've been growing it gets more and more difficult to see it as something achievable.

"Mom, don't even dig any more. The only thing that's left is that Jose Luis is my relative"

That would explain how I'm broken.

I hear them talking about stuff. How did people got to be? My father is now talking about the theory of evolution and he's being mocked. He is actually correct. Are they morons?

I feel like a teenager. This familiar feeling of being buried in my own room and self-pity, hating the world and myself, and feeling as the last sensible and perceptive person of the world. I was pathetic. I am ashamed of those days.

Why am I behaving in that same way?

Then I couldn't imagine a future in which I could ever be happy. I created a plausible outcome of a successful future based on everybody's expectations. A wife and a house and a career and maybe kids. Being a successful man would make me eventually a happy man.

I was wrong. I guess, I never got to be neither successful nor a man.

I'll never be a man, and I'm fine with that. Will I get to be successful? Is it possible?

I thought about adding Yadira in Facebook. Rene's comments made me think about being "active" and me sending the requests, waiting to be accepted or rejected.

No, actually he said to wait. Eventually people would notice me and add me, know me and look for me.

He, or his silence, has a point. Telling my contacts and waiting for them to add me is telling the world. Telling my close friends and far away relatives and barely acquaintances. They'll know and have a direct knowledge of where to find me and know about me.

But is waiting more direct and active? If I add Yadira she might never accept me, or even if she does, will we talk? Will I tell her? Will she know who am I?

I want people to see me. I can wait for them to recognize me or look for me or I can shout in their faces.

How can I shout if I don't even dare to whisper to the people who share a roof with me?

### 2016-07-10

Liliana called me first thing in the morning. My pits smell. I did the exercise and showered at noon. I guess the hormones have not changes my body odor yet. I went to the bathroom and put deodorant. As I took my shirt I glimpsed at my body. It's flabby and chubby. I was supposed to be losing weight.

So Liliana called me. It was a normal call, a phone call. I answered and she told me how Karla's mother had talked to her and told her that she's been having a kind of crisis, maybe a psychotic one.

I could had let it pass had I not applied the MMPI. Wow. Anyway, tomorrow is her session, so I could give her the results with her. She knows I wanted the both of us to review them, and she got sick and all that.

And then, unexpectedly I had something to do. I sent her the results. I reviewed them myself and the whole day spent redacting the conclusions. Just now I've finished and sent the report to the printer. Tomorrow I'll buy a folder on the way to the office.

Why did it lift my mood? I was like an old piece of shit, lying motionless in my bed stinking the whole bedroom. These past few days not even a conversation with Catherine could make me feel better.

I woke up early, a little past the call. I went to the living room and lied on the couch. The edge of the phone was on my lips and my sight was resting in the ceiling. I was disappointed, Lili had called and set up the meeting and I did not tell her. Tomorrow might be an opportunity. Catherine advised me how I could just wait until she mention a new patient and then I can tell her.

But is really that the best option? If she sends me a new patient she'll tell them my contact information, they look for me as Ivan the psychologist. I don't like introducing me that way.

Last thursday was excruciating wearing an androgynous attire, how am I going to go tomorrow?

The patient has not seen me in half a month. Lili a little more than that. She keeps calling me handsome boy. Do I want her to be incorrect? I wish she would see me and the compliment just doesn't fit.

I haven't shaved since Thursday. It's been three days. I should let my stubble. Shave it Wednesday. Feel the little black hairs shedding and falling out, seeing them dead in the palms of my hands and the tips of my fingers.

Four sessions.

What was it that made me see the chart of hormonal changes. The only one that start before the three months are erections and libido. Both of them are totally gone. The rest start by the 6th month. I'm not even half. Why am I so desperate?

Does Rene have a point?

Am I rushing into things?

Catherine said something about arranging her pictures from last year, from this one. I opened the application and reviewed some. The one where I go to Pockets and play with pool with them. I look hideous. How could I step outside looking like that? She told me how she found me really feminine in one picture. I look bloated and masculine broad face feminized in a mediocre attempt at make up.

I see some pictures of those times and I feel nauseous and disgusted. And yet I don't dare to delete them. I like seeing them and then browsing the next ones. I see them, the one when I went to the first appointment to the endocrinologist. Even before then. I dressed in a sweater and leggings and went to a restaurant in my birthday. I was seen and referred as a woman months before even starting hormones, hours before making the appointment. Then I have the other ones closer to the date. I'm in Catherine's bed, and the pills are over her sheets and I'm smiling and excited, minutes before being freaked out and scared about the dosages.

A couple of days later I go to the ceremony where I receive the first Scholar mention, or was it the Egel? The first month, then the second in Guadalajara, dressed as a boy and later that day, still with male clothes look androgynous enough to be seen as a woman.

Today Johanna liked three of my pictures in Facebook. She got into my profile.

I had given up on her.

I gave up on her and she came back.

She came back.

### 2016-07-11

I had the session, the last one with the last patient. We sat in a room the four of us, Liliana by my side and the patient and her mother in front of us. I was nervous. I printed the report since yesterday. It was stapled over my desk waiting.

Did I dream something today? What times was it when I woke up? I got up from bed. I ate breakfast. The biscuit from Saturday. Today is monday. Tomorrow I have the whole day for myself. I have no work, no to dos left. I'm free. This wednesday I'll see Rene and I don't know what I'll say.

The last messages I sent Catherine was about this house. She asked me if I haven't talked with Luis about how I feel when he calls me Ivan. I haven't. There is no point. Yesterday we talked about Liliana. If I tell her I have doubts she'll ask me what I want to do. Do I want to start seeing patients as Sofia? Do I want her to keep sending me patients? It's similar with Luis. What's the point of telling him I'm hurt every time he calls me by my former name. Do I want him to call me differently? What will he do when our grandma is nearby?

"This is not my house. This is Ivan's home."

I showered and changed. I wasn't going to shave. There were noticeable and thick black hairs in the sides of my chin. Just there. Some shorter ones spread on a tiny patch in my cheeks. And that was it. I could had left them be. But they looked weird. I sent a picture to Catherine and her opinion was tu cut them, too. I used the machine. I left home by one.

I stayed in my car half an hour until the meeting hour. I read the conclusions of the report to familiarize myself with it. The mother arrived close to me. She walked towards Lili office and kept walking. I went to the other corner of the second floor. Liliana arrived a couple of minutes after two. We waited a little until the patient came.

And then it was just results. I explained and exposed. I taught and clarified. I gave examples and I finished. The patient confirmed most of the things I had to say. "Yeah, yeah" "Have you felt like this?" "On occasions" She cried. It's scary to hear schizophrenia and paranoia. I know it is. I was scared myself.

I got paid and left. We talked for three minutes and that was it. I made no mention of my situation. She gave them the contact of the psychiatrist. Dr Maldonado, like my father.

"Maldonado, right?" confirmed the mother. "Yeah", I told her before Lili.

"No... Oh wait, yeah, Maldonado. Magallanes is my doctor, Maldonado is my son's."

She goes to the same doctor as I do. I could had said something, but I did not.

I was bored home when I scrolled on facebook. My contacts are way less than in the other account.

I changed to the other profile and looked at the new things. Then it appeared. Monica Gonzales. Why did she came up? This time she was with Moncayo. Yesterday. They went to a bar. Diana and Rafa were there, too.

Some contact of Omar thought of them as a couple. She wore make up. Heavier than other times. She was wearing when we met outside the movies, too. How embarrassing that your exboyfriend wears more make up than you, it's almost as "seeing that a tranny looks better than you".

I don't know, and can't know that she put it because she saw me. Probably it's not. Why would she? It's just like imagining them asking Monica how and why and when did we break up. She has more than a year with her boyfriend. They have no reason to mention me in their catching up. They don't even remember me, why would they think of me?

Because somebody might have seen the profile and the picture.

I don't know and probably never won't.

It's absurd. I wanted to make it public, post it somewhere everyone could see so I could avoid this, people talking behind my back, asking questions, making assumptions. Posting it won't solve that, that could it even make it worse.

Do I want to cause it?

I kept mocking Luis today about his nipples slipping out of his tank. He answered back that at least his wouldn't be censored in a picture.

Did he say that on purpose referring to mine or was he making a point about the situation with trans' nipples?

Sometimes I think I overestimate him.

### 2016-07-12

There is a lot of shit in my bed. Lots and lots of mementos and cards and bags and stuff. I took down everything from the shelves and the upper side of the bookcase and the boxes from over my closet. There is a white bag filled with trash. I took pictures from jr highschool and threw them away. I took the pages off the notebook of signatures from grade school. All the box of childhood memories is inside the bag of jr high school pictures. I put lots of the memories of university in a box and left it for later to clean. As I took the childhood memories I shared what was inside with Catherine. Snapshots of the pictures, and the toys and audios of me narrating the days from when I was seven years old.

The year 2k. Fifteen years ago. I noticed the immatureness and the innocence and the excitement of childhood. I wish I could go back in time and see him. I remember being a little boy and picturing myself as a grown up. I didn't know why but I was sure I'd wear glasses. Did I see me with long or shorter hair? Would I recognize me? Would I think I look girly?

How would I react were I to see me dressed femininely. "Who's that woman? ...Am I her? But how?"

Would I be scared or relieved?

I could imagine lots and lots of things, maybe I could be close to guessing my profession. Psychologist, applying psychometric tests, using math to evaluate people's personalities and mental quirks. Studying the brain, yeah.

Would I be proud that I've gotten over my fear of needles? Would I be ashamed that I take hormones so I look like a girl?

I opened Monica's box. Catherine told me it was fine and I could share its insides as well. I started taking a picture of everything, there were postcards of the ship in LA and from the Beatles Laser show. Inside was a cigar box of Abbey Road. In there a little red ribbon and a note. I thought it was too personal to share its contents. I read it.

"My Ivan..." she told me how she loved me and explained the little gifts. In there was the hair pins of her childhood and the cigar box and the pajama string from the first time we chatted on the phone. Where did I left it? I think I threw it away. I turn my head and look at the night light and the cords that are tied on it. I looked for that blue string but it's not there. Why do I want it? Why do I want to remember? Why do I feel like it's something forbidden?

I told Catherine that I could not. The letter was from before I left to Spain. Was it before or after we were to the hotel and I received the notification of the visa? Was it before or after I broke up with her over the phone?

I cried but it wasn't because of the content. I told Catherine that I had decided to threw away the whole box. Was I lying or did I change my mind? Why did I put it away?

I keep thinking about that blue string. I threw away her blue bra and the hair pins, I shredded to pieces the drawing I made her years ago. Why is that string more important?

I had an insight. We chatted a little about the exes. I did tell Catherine I wished she had exes experiences like mine. It came back today. It's true, my problems with Monica are not because she's my ex. It's more complicated than that.

And it came, and with the realization came the gut punch that brought me to tears.

I don't hate her because of our relationship or its ending. I don't mind the lack of affection or intimacy, I don't care about stupid breaks or even what happened when she left the first time to Mexico. I've gotten all that.

I'm not even mad about her leaving and rejection. It's not our friendship that I mourn. It's that she's gone and she never forgave me.

I cheated in my own kind of way with both of them. I asked her if she could love me, accept me and she did not know. She was hesitant to the idea. "I don't know, I can't answer, I can't say. I'm scared that I'll say yes and then I won't feel the same or that I'll say no and realize the mistake I made." She wasn't sure I would be me.

I went to Spain and when I returned I betrayed her, I made her think I was still Ivan. Like the shot I repaired today, I came broken and in pieces. As I put myself back up, there are pieces missing.

And then, a semester later, Ivan was gone. Ivan was dead. I took her lover away from her, the man she had planned a life with and who would always love, her best friend. He's gone because of me and we never talked about it. I realized it in january, a year after my departure. She was gone by then, she had abandoned me like she promised she would not do. She stayed in France for half a year and we kept talking, sometimes, pretending it was all the same and I had not changed.

When she returned we did not meet. And I was angry at her, because I could not deal being angry at me for what I had done. And then the silences began. I was guilty and she was distant. Until she left for good. Until she told me directly how she could not be my friend and left.

She loved him, she promised him love and hates me.

Is that why I am scared of my parents? I took her lover away. What will happen when I take my family's son and brother? Will they hate me, too?

Is that why I can't deal with them seeing me?

### 2016-07-13

Catherine's new profile picture is an hour old and has 18 likes. 18 people have seen it and clicked a button to express their approval. It means nothing, it's worth nothing. It's not something material, just an abstract quantification, a number.

I talked to Rene. I picked Catherine from her house.

Don't know why, but I just came from walking upstairs looking for a pair of double A batteries. I put them in the white dog that dances to music. It's yellow now after the years it lied out of use. Is it dead?

"I travelled the world looking to find myself. In my search I ended up shattered and broken.
After time I decided to pick up the pieces. The missing fragments are part of my history, of who I am."

I thought about posting the pictures of the broken shot glass, and those could be the words to accompany them. What's the point if no one will see?

Since yesterday we talked about going to the park. I picked her up and drove us to my session. We parked outside the grade school. We walked and I held her hand. I know it makes her uncomfortable, I know she gets nervous and feels exposed. Is that why I do it? Do I want her to feel how I feel? Is it on purpose?

In our way we stopped in food garden. We bought a big cup of thai tea. She ordered it. Nobody looked at us. They let us be.

We stayed the rest of out extra time outside the building, seated, talking, smiling.

"Does it bother you that I play pokemon, too?", I told her the truth, I feel similarly to Anahi. When we talked with her, I felt letdown. She talks about those same people who mocked her because of playing videogames are now posting images of themselves with that stupid game. She hasn't even played pokemon.

I remember those times when I was 6 or 7 years old. Edgar had a gameboy pocket. He bought the blue version of the game, the one with Blastoise, the big turtle with cannons on his shoulders. I played that game. Didn't really understood it, but I played it. I ended up owning it years later with a bunch of other games. Outside the CECUT we dad parked the van and when we returned somebody stole my backpack with toys and the game boy.

I talked with Rene, but felt no point. He made no comment that I couldn't had realized myself. Should I really keep going? Yeah. I'm on medication. He is supervising it. He has helped me.

"How can she be friends with the woman who took Ivan from her"

Was that what hurt me or his worry that a potential patient could feel let down because he was told he would meet with the psychologist Sofia.

I cried. I ought to bring the count to 0 again.

We drove directly to the park after that. We were alone for a couple of minutes until Anahi caught up with us. Her bra was really small, I thought I could see her nipple through her blouse but doubted about saying something.

We ate the sandwiches Catherine made and the chips I took from home. I took pictures with my phone and Anahi's. I asked her for the code so I could see them. She told me she had deleted them already. Maybe she was just messing around. I tried putting the code but ended up blocking it. A minute of waiting until a next try. She put the code wrongly and the wait was for five minutes. When I mentioned it again, she got it wrong again on purpose, the wait was 15 minutes. I was sad and mad, I was upset.

I said no other word about it, and let the day continued as if nothing had happened.

I hate that kind of fellowship. It's not fun, it's hurtful. I don't really want those kind of friends.

They talked about Catherine's new job, the application, the process. Anahi's new studies. She could get a technical certification. Catherine thought about it. What if I don't get into the master? "Would you get upset if I after not getting I decide to stay here?"

"No, I mean, yeah, but you can totally do that."

But did I mean it?

Even now I'm worried. I'll end up alone, just as I feared. Without a home nor a therapist nor a endocrinologist.

I won't have any help, any family, any friend.

I'll be totally alone in a place where absolutely not a single person will know my legal name or my story.

Isn't that what I want?

### 2016-07-14

I cried yesterday like I've not cried in years. Tears drowned my face, the sorrow wrapped my throat and held me to bed.

What was it that we talked about?

It al started with a simple phrase: "I'm a little sad because of everything". Everything was 5 things, now I can't even remember them. Catherine tried to make me feel better but it was counterproductive. Was it an argument, a fight?

We both were crying. We explained and I talked why I think telling the things and emotions are a mistake. Opening up doesn't help. I expose myself and wear my own vulnerability and it doesn't change a thing. I don't feel better but worse.

I can't remember the last things we talked about. Pictures, Anahi, the capital. I feel lonely and invisible. I keep hiding myself even though I don't really want to. I try to fool myself into thinking there is no longer any feeling of shame inside of me.

Yesterday when I returned I put my hoodie before entering the door. I covered the little and barely noticeable breasts that protruded from the blouse. Tiny and sensible plums underneath my nipples. My mother asked me to pick Luis and my grandma up from school today. She would leave them by 9, the time the meeting was supposed to start, I could pick them up at 10. When they were finished they would go buy tacos and I'd look for them there.

Then the night came and Catherine and I cried under the silence of the moon.

By 2 in the morning we stop sharing messages. I don't recall the time I finally went to sleep. Did I hear something? I think I sent Catherine a message telling her both my mom and grandma were speaking loudly.

I got up earlier than I had to. I didn't shower, I just put jeans and went. I could meet them earlier. I could eat with them freshly or just come home. I left closer to 9 than 10. I arrived a quarter before the hour. There was nobody. Sure, they could be waiting inside.

I put gas before leaving. The dispatcher didn't welcomed me in a gender way. I looked androgynous enough to be met with ambiguity. I put 100.

I still felt the sadness from the night. I was tired and miserable. I ate the burrito that was in the table but waited until coming back to take the hormones.

I was upset and annoyed by having to wait for them. I moved the car like 5 times. I parked in front of the school, in front of the taco cart and then the school again, and then nearby. Finally I stopped and waited a little before entering the principal offices. I looked Luis going out from the door and our grandmother following him. I opened the door and let them in. "Have you been here for long?"

"Like an hour" I exaggerated a little rounding up. It was a muted tone of voice, not really angry, just tired. Exhausted. Had I any emotion in me left? My grandmother explained and try to make smalltalk along the way home. I didn't shut her off, but not really continued it. I speeded a little out of frustration. I was caught in the inside of the roundabout and got stuck behind slow cars in the highway.

When home I did not say a word. I took my pills and went back to bed. I cried several times today.

I opened Monica's box that I was letting for later. More than half of its contents I threw away. I kept the notes and important mementos and, apart, the things she could want back or I would feel guilty throwing to the trash.

I cried reading the letters. Her love, how she would always be mine, there was nothing that could set us apart. I was that nothing. I took her lover away and killed him. I murdered him in Spain and came in his place. He was more feminine than when I pretended to be him. Did she notice the difference? Was I convincing? Did she come better with me than with him?

Catherine told me that it's something that could not be avoided. I did what I had to do. I could not pretend to be him forever. I would be unhappy, it would not be my life. I'd be dead.

I kept the items as if there is still a chance of seeing her again.

Am I optimistic or just a fool?

### 2016-07-15

30 days again.

Today was a calm and silent day. I did shower for a change and did my exercises, too.

I finished sorting out the boxes of mementos and the drawer with the stuff. My clothes are ready for tomorrow. I am excited and nervous. We talked about how we would do it. Catherine will pick me up early and drove the both of us to find parking near the border. We'll look for a pot near the new border crossing. After getting to the other side, we'll make a stop in the carl's jr where Anahi works. She will leave her job application, no, she'll ask for one. Anahi forgot hers before leaving.

I'm supposed to wake up by 5 in the morning. I'll shower and shave my face and comb my hair. I'll dress up and maybe apply some of my face before waiting her to come.

I keep thinking about adding Monica, sending her the request and just waiting. But waiting for what, exactly? She could either accept it or not. And if she does? Would I send her a message? Would I look for news about her? Do I want her to see my posts?

I've been thinking about apologizing. Asking if she resents me. Offering to give her her stuff back.

I feel like a pushover, insignificant. It's a mixture of both feeling like a monster and the victim. I pity her and hate her.

She promised me to stay and left, she promised me support and bailed. I made her fall in love with a lie. I took away the man she dreamed a future with.

I told my parents about going out tomorrow but did not say where. My grandma gave me the earrings and the bracelet for Catherine. She asked for the ring but I didn't give it back. I made like I was looking for it but she did not wait.

She asked Miguel if he had someone, too, a girlfriend. I have a girlfriend but I am nobody's boyfriend. I am not a boy.

How many times do I have to type it before I truly believe it?

A year ago I went scared about wearing jeggings and a blouse, tomorrow I'll cross wearing leggings and a blouse under my shirt. That's my "boymode" I'll took off the shirt, put the white dress I bought and then loose the leggings.

I hope I look drastically different to me from a year ago. I hope people gender me feminine and it doesn't surprise me. I hope I no longer feel nervousness riding the bus nor the trolley.

Will I take pictures with my phone or will I take the camera? Will I post them? Will I share them?

My aunts might see them if I post them in snapchat. Distant friends might, too.

I no longer care. Yesterday I thought about posting it on Facebook. Talking with Catherine we both came to the same conclusion that I am not really ready. I hesitate before entering home dressing some ways. Even now I haven't considered how will I return home. I'll leave it wearing an androgynous outfit, but I'll came back wearing the dress. My father has seen me in a different one, Luis as well. My mother should be the person whom I should be less nervous about. Miguel I know I don't mind. It's my grandmother whom I hesitate about.

Catherine will bring be back. I'll open the door with both a rainbow and a trans bracelet. A bag and maybe bags with rainbow stuff. Will I be wet like last year? Will I be smiling or upset? Will something happen?

Why should I worry? Lots of things could happen. Last year there were people on the trolley harassing and talking about god and sexual sins. Do I want them to come to me and screamed at our faces? Tell me I'm an abomination and our love is something to be ashamed of?

I don't expect Catherine to speak up. Would I?

I want to. I want to defend our love. Telling them it's not of their business. But what if it's me who they attack? What if my voice betrays me and get called a faggot or a failed man or a tranny.

Would I dare to open my mouth?

Nothing might happen.

But shit might, too.

Maybe in the pride, like Catherine's scared of. Maybe on the crossing or at Anahi's job. Maybe in the festival or on our way home. Maybe home.

Would I dare face them dressed like that? Would I dare confront my grandmother and explain? I went to the pride parade. I am not really gay, but yeah, kind of. I'm with Catherine, and we're both women. You see, I'm trans.

I am trans.

I am trans and should not be ashamed.

I hope some day I get to feel proud.

### 2016-07-16

Okay let's try this I've written the words before in both my tablet and my phone now I'm not writing at all I'm dictating the words and my tablet is writing them down this is supposed to be faster than other ways I think I'm getting the hang of it no nevermind I keep saying words and words and sure the tablet writes them down but it's mistaken several times it's a chore going back and correcting it myself sure I mean my laptop is updating to a new software I was going to write them down on this tablet and I thought about trying this new software and here I am lying in my bed saying words and seeing them appearing into white screen today was Pride Catherine was with me the whole day it was fun I enjoy it mostly I'm really tired I guess I should begin writing now it was a nice exercise to realize how good my pronunciation in English is.

Yeah that's enough. I'll write normally now.

We both woke up by 5 in the morning. The sun wasn't even thinking about showing. Everything was dark and quiet and we started before the day.
She picked me up quicker than I expected. I was wearing the leggings and a white blouse under the denim shirt. I put the sunscreen on my face after getting my head right. The minutes before Catherine's arrival I finished giving colour to my face. Just smoothening it a little amount.

I was way less nervous than last year. We found parking easily near the new border crossing. I changed a thousand pesos to dollars. I don't really know how I looked.

The first words Catherine said to me as I got in her car were: "you look so girly"

We got to the bridge in the river. It was barely standing. A couple o aluminum platforms bridged until the start of the building receiving the peatons from Mexico.

There was almost no line. I could count easily the people in front of us. The cbp closest to the door was asking the guy to lift his shirt and turn around. It got me scared. What would happen when they see my name?

It was my turn. He asked me where I was going and I told the truth. San Diego, what was I going to do in San Diego? Well, going to balboa Park.

"are you JosÃƒÂ© IvÃƒÂ¡n?" "Yeah", I answered again saying the truth without bring totally frank. "ok, have fun, man"

I have the picture we took of us crossing the new border entry. I don't look as feminine as I thought. Yeah, I looked girly but it wasn't unbelievable that I were a boy.

First we went to Anahi's work. We crossed a couple of minutes shy of 7 and got there a couple after eight. Anahi made my breakfast burger and put extra hashbrowns in it. She took her 10 minutes break to chat with us. Catherine filled her job application. I went to the bathroom to change. I put the shirt over the thing with the toilet paper. I hesitated before putting my bag on the ground. I took the dress and put them over my head and shoulders. The leggings were the last to go. I put on the shirt and exited. There was voices, a woman and a child. One of them inside the cubicle, the words were as if there was something between them. I was out and nervous. I looked at her directly in the eyes when I walked towards the sink.

I forgot if there was a mirror or not. We went to Wal mart, she bought a cable for her phone and I, a replacement to my mascara.

The bathrooms were closed and there was no small mirrors.

I put the rest of my make up outside in the bus stop. We got to university Ave just as the parade was starting. The "dykes on bikes" were passing by with a rainbow-colored cloud of smoke following them.

We walked to find good places. Some people arrived and moved closer and closer to the street covering the view. Catherine seemed tired and in a bad mood. I asked her to move but she said no. I moved a couple of times to take pictures. I finally found a better place and told her I would be over there. She came some time later. She was upset and cried a little. She later would tell me she felt out of place. I remember Anahi's words. I understand here. They're proud and celebrating and dancing and cheering.

She barely accepts she's bi. She's still nervous about being seen with me holding hands. She hasn't told her father.

Gladly she felt a little better as the day passed. We got some free stuff. The booth of the sex toys was different this time. Now the gifts were cheaper and just one slot of the roulette gave a toy.

We both ended getting one. Several times did people referred to us as ladies.

At first it was hurting waving and feeling ignored. It wasn't until later that I could see them starting waving back after meeting my sight.

"Bang them, sister!" one of the men said after I waved at him. When I did, he cheered.

Later, getting to the festival we met the black man who danced over a truck. He smiled at me and I waved again. He exclaimed "I really like that girl!"

There were two people manifesting about religion. A couple of men confronted them one hugged him and the other asked him what Love meant.

He came to us to tell Ã¢â‚¬Å“He told me Jesus didn't love me, can you believe it? I told him he loves everyone. How could he not love me when he made me this fabulous?"

I returned in a dress, nervous and afraid. I heard the TV when I turned the key and opened the door. My parents my brothers, my grandmother. I didn't know what to expect. The living room was empty.

Was it a victory or a disappointment?



### 2016-07-17

I am not going to do any exercise today. Yesterday I walked close to 10 kilometers. My shoulders are red and furious. My face is reddened and sore. Even raising my arm constricts the swollen skin on the shoulder and it screams in pain. Lying on my side is excruciating, stomach-down, I tend to use my arms as a support to my head, so unconsciously lifting them is a source of discomfort. Sleeping on my back is my least favorite way to rest and now my only option.

I returned to bed after breakfast. I slept two or three hours passing noon. Yesterday I ate not much, today I took what I left the day before. I took the usual biscuit, then four cookies. I ate what was left of my bowl and a sandwich, in the evening I finished with a steak sandwich.

I drank mostly water but still is a lot of food.

I feel tired. Tomorrow I think I'll send a message to Liliana. Rene is pressuring me subtly to do it. I want to, anyway.

If she asks me, will I let her present to me as Sofia? The pride was a confident booster, but am I ready? Do I pass? Has she forgotten? Of course not.

We accorded to see the last episode of Orange is the new black in Catherine's house tomorrow. She proposed it. I had the idea it was me who asked her not to go to her house. Stopped being seen as Ivan and called in the masculine.

My mother asked my opinion about what Luis said to his female friend about her bathing suit. Was it because I studied psychology or because she saw me as a woman, too?

Will I dare to correct them or show myself?

I was going to, I did enter to the house in the dress. I did not know the living room was going to be empty.

Will I see my patients in dresses or jeans and blouses? I have the full black bag of clothes still in the room next to mine. My closet is less filled. My formal clothes are in my mother's closet and I don't pretend to wear them anymore. There is no point in taking them to the laundry.

I thought about telling them of the graduation. Reminding them that I have to buy what I'm going to wear. I don't even consider going in a suit.

"The graduation I'm invited to will be in September, I have to buy what I'm going to wear" "What will you wear, a suit?", I guess they're going to ask.

"I won't wear another suit in my life" I said to the imaginary conversation playing inside my head.

Yesterday Luis set up his phone and I put in there the numbers of both my mom and dad. When I put mine, I hesitated when filling the information. What's my name? He knows. Why couldn't I just type it?

What's stopping me? From where does the shame keeps coming?

Of what am I ashamed? I am a woman, I am starting to look like one. I am comfortable when people see me and treat me as one. Why do I fear being denied when nobody has done it?

Again I hesitated before posting the status update. I thought about posting more pictures about the parade and the festival. Ones with Catherine and me, hugging and smiling and making faces and having fun.

I'm proud of her. I used to think I'd leave the Facebook without a trace of my history as a trans person. And then again I keep going back to the idea of linking it to the previous profile or posting the picture with me and the trans bracelet.

When I told Catherine about my hesitation she asked me if it was because of her. I lied and told her no. It's true that I have other reasons. Why couldn't I say how much it hurt me that she denies me?

She's ashamed of me. I am, too, so I don't think I can blame her.

She invited me to her home and I'm nervous about being seen by her parents. Her mother's denial and her father's obliviousness. Is he, though? Does he really not know?

Will he ask me personally why did I stop going? Will he make a comment about my recent absence?

How will I react when I hear that name, when I'm referred mistakenly?

Do I have a right to be upset when even in my own home I'm unknown?

### 2016-07-18

I was mistaken for my mother in the phone again. This time it was laughed about and shared with my grandmother later on the phone as I passed it. Minutes later she would tell my mom about it. "What was it that she said to you? 'Hello, lady"? " She did not such thing. She said hello in a knowing sing-y tone and I asked with whom she wanted to speak. Then she realized I was not Laura.

She's gone. She left because she has an appointment tomorrow, maybe? I could now post it and don't worry about her comments. I can leave home in a dress or whatever outfit I desire. I don't have to worry anymore about whom I find as I open the front door. Now everyone in this home know about me.

I closed Facebook. Since the start of the day I checked the status of the pictures updating and all. In dropbox just the video is missing. I uploaded some of the favorite pictures of the parade to Facebook. It was a gut punch when the option of tagging people came. I asked Catherine before, if she would be upset about me posting the one where we kissed. I remember my last relationship and Monica's reluctance to publish our relationship status in there. This is different. Her parents doesn't know we're a couple. They don't know me. Her mother does, it's just her father.

To him she's Ivan's girlfriend.

But that was not the suckerpunch I was referring about. Yeah, the option appeared again when I hovered the mouse over her face. Did I want to tag Catherine Rodriguez?, a little pop up window would say. It recognized her picture and proposed the idea. Facebook is a tattle tale and an ignorant. It doesn't know the problems and complications about our family and my own identity. That's why when I hovered my own face it asked me if I wanted to tag Ivan to the pictures. It doesn't know we're not the same person. That I'm not him. It just sees the face and thinks we share it. Will people think that, too?

I was hesitant about posting them. Yeah, it's hard. It's painful the feeling about doubting showing myself and then just realizing nobody notices. I posted a picture months before and it stayed ignored and unseen. Would this happen again? Would it be coming back from the pride with knots in my stomach and my trembling swallowed feet as I opened the door expecting judging and confused eyes upon me just to be met with an alone tv preaching to an empty room.

Minutes, no, fractions of one barely passed before the first notification appeared. Jhonny had liked the album, when he started reacting to the pictures I closed the tab. Will I react the same way when I finally post the status in Ivan's profile?

I have Rene's words in my ears. Both about the status update and Liliana. It's just two days before I see him again. Today I sent Liliana the text message telling her I want to talk to her, asking her for a free time she has in the week so I can meet with her. I confessed it was about the patients but it was something personal I wanted to talk about in person and not by the phone.

The message was sent around noon. She saw it an hour, maybe after that. It's still unanswered. She's busy, I know. She has a filled schedule, I know that, too. If tomorrow or the day after I don't get a response I might send her a voice message.

I won't need to, after all. She just answered and my stomach is knotting again, converging into itself, growling. I'm both nervous and relieved.

I just accepted the proposal and confirmed. Tomorrow by three I'll see her in her office.

I will go. What will I wear? "Hello, my handsome boy" Will that be the last time she says that?

Should I go androgynous or complete feminine? I don't think I'm ready to wear make up just now.

How will I say it?

She'll say hi and kiss my cheek and invite me to enter, I guess. And then? Will I start just then? will I hesitate?

"Yeah, I've been meaning to say it, but it's hard. I know you've been busy and we haven't had much time. You know about me, I'm not a boy, nor Ivan. I am trans. And that's the thing. I don't know what to do...

When I started I really doubted what to do and how, the first patient knew me as Ivan and I thought that was going to be it, you know? It was settled. Professionally I could still be him at least until I left to the capital and continue with my transition and change my papers and all that, sure it would be hard, but doable.

But that's the thing. Since then, I've started transition. I've had 4 laser sessions in my face. I've been in hormones for almost three months. The changes are not really obvious yet, but yeah, I don't know if I'll be able to hide them for long.

And it really scares me. I don't know what to do. I don't have much experience with patients and I'm lost with my situation.

Will I be ready to present myself as who I really am? Will they respect me? Will it be impossible or difficult?

I know how I look, and that's why the urgency of saying it. But I don't know how I'm seen or how I will be."

### 2016-07-19

There are red tiny little dots in my upper arms. It's not a stinging pain, just an uncomfortable reminder of my sun poisoning. It's fading, I guess.

I went to Liliana's office and talked. I waited until time let me in. A couple of minutes after three, she opened the door to go to the bathroom and I waited standing. I was talking with Catherine on whatsapp. I was pretty nervous. Not like before entering my parents' bedroom with the plaque or when I was trapped in my bedroom wearing the blue dress.

It's not pain, it's itching. I want to pass my hand over the skin and calm the sensation. Tell myself "Yes, I know... what can I do?". Scratching hurts me, it brings me pain and yet doing it is something uncontrollable. I can't avoid it. I know it's bad, I know I'll regret it. And yet I stopped typing and take both my hands to my arms and dig my pointy nails into the skin.

Claudia added me to Facebook. She's Anahi's friends. She is Fernando's ex-girlfriend. I accepted her. Maybe it was the comment I made in Anahi's post about pokemon go in Sea World.

She sent me a text message: did I make another facebook or had she not added me before? She was confused.

Was her confusion about not having me in her friend list or because of my pictures and name? I answered her implicit question. It's a new facebook, it's me, I'm trans.

Moments after that was when Liliana came to the door and let me in.

After talking with her I stopped in the bakery. I bought three pieces of sweet bread. One sugary pastry of twisted donut, and two biscuits. I ate one and give the donut to Luis. I just took one bit. Before me entered a woman and a little girl. She was young and cute, a small child of no more than 4. She looked at me more than the woman, she looked and turned again. Was it my hair or my body? What was it that she saw?

I had tried gone femininely to Liliana. I wore the shorts I bought with Catherine and one of the tanks from Target. Over it I had the long black sweater covering my reddened shoulders from the sun. When the woman finished paying the man behind the cashier extended my hand asking for my platter. I lend it to him and waited for the woman and child the leave. He said: "it's 30, miss"

I smiled and thanked him. Two coins for my jar. I paid with the rest of the money my mother gave to me for bringing ice. She gave me 300 pesos. 100 went to my phone.

With Liliana I said it. I told her my worry and uneasiness. I told her I've started treatment. I've started changing. I'm unsure of how to present myself and show myself. I cried when I expressed my doubt of being "ready" to be seen as a girl.

It was reassuring and comforting. I've done it and I can tell Rene tomorrow.

I even talked about my thoughts of posting it on Facebook. She gave me the idea I had flirted with about sending a private message to certain contacts. Just a few of the closest ones, the ones I wish them to know, and tell them and give the info about the new profile. At first I thought it was the answer to the problem, yet coming home I came back to square one.

Where would I draw the line. Catherine asked me if the action of selecting a few would mean rejection when their lack of answer would seem apparent. It wasn't though.

Catherine told her father. He was going to the bathroom and she asked him if he was going to take a bath. "Yeah, why, do you want to chat?" She was just about to tell him to no, and go to the bathroom, when she finally took the chance. She started with and introduction to the conversations they've had. Then she told her secret. Later she would tell mine. He took it better than her mom.

It's done, she's said it. She's not rested, though. It's as if things are left to say, secrets still kept.

I found her words familiar. After my mom was my dad. Then it was a matter of telling my brothers. When I did, it was about being seen and when I showed myself it's about telling the world.

Is that why I want to tell everyone?

Where would I draw the line. From whom do I want to keep the information? Why? Why do I feel like hiding it still?

### 2016-07-20

"Your mouth looks very red", she was just coming down the stairs and stopped in the opening mid-floor just behind the television. I had my legs crossed under me in the sofa and was sitting next to Luis. Silently I nodded my head with shyness. Everyone in the house had seen me before. My father came outside to move the pick-up after Miguel opened the curtains and saw me park. Luis was sitting in the couch and Miguel at the table. Nobody said anything.

I showed Luis the video of me in Argana blowing smoke out of my red lips. The white shirt that covered my dress was beside me.

What was I wearing when they left to Costco?

I had taken a picture to ask Catherine what shoes to wear. My legs were covered in black leggings and over I had the pink tank. I could either wear the red shirt with squares or the white one with gray stripes.

I was asking about the shoes. I had decided about wearing the white one. She told me she thought I was going to wear the white blouse. After a series of misunderstood messages I ended up changing the tank for the creamy blouse I bought but never worn. Over it I wore the white shirt.

And then I left. I drove to Rene's and parked in the lot next to my highschool. With Rene I spoke securely about what has happened. I shared my own interpretation of the need to shared it on Facebook. I had thought about posting it today. Entering the session and just tell him "I've done it".

My mother hasn't seen me in a dress. She noticed my red lips today. Was she making a comment because she dares to notice, to talk about it? My dad doesn't, then? Does he see?

I can tell them. I'm scared about what they will say. I have a full black thrash bag with the clothes I will no longer wear. They don't either fit or they are way too manly for me to feel comfortable in. It's not just me. Yeah, I hate looking like a man, but when I go out in "normal" clothes, is when people stare and get confused or noticeably uncomfortable. They only time people have mocked me is when I was wearing man's clothes.

When I go out in female clothes or wear make up, it's like I turn invisible, no, they notice me, but I look normal. People smile more, look more calm or apathetic. They don't hesitate nor get uncomfortable when they have to address me. I mean, yeah, I've been harassed, too, I guess, but for being a woman, not for being trans. I've gotten catcalled, but who hasn't.

Would I really dare to say that?

That's the reason. I feel more comfortable, I feel amazing when I get validated by strangers. Months ago I was terrified of even driving female clothes. Now, I prefer it.

I've talked with my boss, the psychologist. The next patients I treat, they'll be referred to Sofia, not Ivan. I'll see them as a woman. I'm nervous, but I want to. It was my decision.

"Tomorrow I'll post the status on Facebook" Just now I write that to Catherine. She put a smiley face. Her parents know, now. Yeah, her uncles and aunts don't, and neither her grand parents.

I will tell her, to tell her parents about my name. I don't want her to refer to me as Ivan. Will I correct Luis, too? Will I let my mother ask me? Am I going to accept her offering or will I ask it to them? Is my dad going to answer with a silent face of disapproval?

Will it be hard for them? For me?

After my session Catherine met me outside the Oxxo. She told me my breasts looked bigger. Later she would add they bounced as I walked. We drove to the beach. We stayed a little in the park and played pokemon. In Argana we ordered food and a pipe. We saw the last episode of OITNB. We were received as ladies. The whole days was that how we were seen. Just once a man kept looking straight at me as he passed me. Did he clock me? Did he see through the make up? Is there something to see?

I'm wearing a trans bracelet. I'm not hiding it. I'm sick of hiding and keeping secrets. Yeah, I'm a woman, and yes, I am trans.

I think this is the first time I might actually believe I'm not ashamed anymore.



### 2016-07-21

I'm thinking about posting it. Making it public, coming out in all the senses of the word. I'm really thinking about it, considering, seeing all the consequences and possibles outcomes, both positive and negative.

What would happen here, home? Everybody knows but nobody says a thing. My mother is the only ones who dares to speak about it, not even me.

Mexicali? Would Cande see it or Edgar would tell her first? What would my uncles and aunts reactions would be? Both my aunt paty and Blanca from fresno have seen my snaps. The ones from pride and the ones from yesterday. I'm wearing a dress and yesterday I had my lips as red as fire.

Tomorrow Catherine'll pick me up. She'll come home in the early evening. She said I could wear the blue dress. Both my father and Luis have seen me in it. Miguel and my mother are the most supporting and knowing ones. Would they say something? Would my mother talk about me in the masculine? Would I dare to tell her my name?

It's hot in here. I did the exercise but could not finish. My tank was soaked and there were dark spots of sweat over my chest. It looks more prominent and noticeable. When I sent Catherine the picture, that was the word she replied.

I keep thinking about tomorrow. My father, who has seen me already won't be home by the time I leave. My mother will. I can mention to her the black bag of clothes that stays here in the back, as if there were any doubts that I want to get rid of those.

What if she asks me if I want clothes? What if she offers to go shopping with me? What if she proposes to change the way she refers to me? Why does it scare me? Why the hell do I want to post it, then?

Rene said it, like psychoanalysis, as you said, it's all about timing.

Is this the right time? Am I ready? Will I ever be?

I signed out of the profile and got into the old one. It's open right now, as if there were any possibility that I'm going to change tabs and post it right now.

Which one scares me the most? That there will be obnoxious comments making questions or jokes? Or that it will stay ignored and invisible?

In this profile, where I'm acquainted with strangers, I can see posts of familiar people. My mother just posted an oblivious game of nominating people to share stupid shit. She posted this picture about motherhood and pride. In the picture Miguel is in the middle, smiling. It's his birthday. Besides him there are my parents, and on the other side, are both Luis and me. I look at myself as if I were a stranger. I see it as if it were so old. Is it my hair or my complexion? Is my face broader and rounder?

Another post is a picture of an old cartoon. It expects the year 2017 and the things to come. Hey Arnold. I saw that show. I liked it. The post is from Moncayo's profile. I see the number of likes in it and get curious. I click there and another window opens with the list of names. The last one is Monica. She didn't even watch it. I know that, she used to tell me when we confided in each other. After seeing her I get irritated. I think about considering looking out for her and yet again I get caught in thinking about her.

There are new episodes of Steven Universe. I saw four when Catherine was doing something. The last one is about Pearl and the relationship with Greg, Steven's dad. She sings about how it's over and Rose chose him. "It's over, why can't I move one?"

Was that the reason I cried? No. I cried when Steven sings to the both of them.

I'm nervous about tomorrow. She'll come in the afternoon. Late in the day, between four and five. What will happen? What will people say? What will I do?

Am I anxious? Today's the last day of rest. Tomorrow I'll continue with the horse urine. Horse piss junkie. I chuckle every time I remember.

Are changes real? I'm not imagining them. I look different. Am I different?

Have I changed?

My mind suddenly went blank. From what thought did I try to escape?

Why do I always keep either hiding or running?

### 2016-07-22

I'm dressed again, the same blue dress, make up and hair. All done and worn. I'm again in my room with the closed door. Am I stuck again? Why don't I open the door? Luis has seen me this way, both in pictures and in person. It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Catherine yesterday said she would pick me up in half an hour. Her car is failing. Her dad would check it. That was a couple of minutes ago and she hasn't answered yet. I was supposed to post it. I thought about it. I want to. People seeing, knowing. This whole house knows and yet everything is the same. I am nervous about my clothes and face. I've been changing.

Have I changed enough?

It's been easier and easier telling people. The first time I lasted like two hours getting the courage and then I couldn't even say the word. Last time I told it like if I had just painted my hair.

Am I ready? Everything was about timing. Do I want my mother confronting me?

Would it be confrontation?

I haven't even reached half of the words for today. Why did I start just now? Because I'm nervous. About what? Going out of this room? Stop hiding here or everywhere?

I've checked the words countless times. Three, four drafts I've made and discarded. The last one I am comfortable with. I read it several times in bed, pronouncing every word under my breath as if I were whispering to the world.

I have the profile open here in the computer. Notifications keep appearing about stuff I don't care about. What people are interested in doing near me, or the likes and comments of the picture my mother posted about maternity, or a new post in the group of the faculty I no longer attend.

I stand up again and again and get close the door. Even though I preach to myself every day about pride and shame I hesitate before opening the door. What is it that I'm scared of? They already know, everybody here. Half of them have seen me. Is it showing myself? Then why do I want to?

I signed out from that profile from every device but here. Will I really post it? I changed tabs a while ago and saw the people online. Vanessa from highschool, my godparents the parents of Jessica, Medrano, classmates of both college and high school. People I don't care about knowing and people I don't really know.

Will my mother call me after seeing it? Will she comment in it and share it? Will she cry and show it to my dad?

She does know I'm trans right? She knows about the laser and endocrinologist and the hormones and the changes. Why is my heart running? Why does every part of me wants to run away?

"Yes, it's me. I am Sofia.

I am not Ivan, nor he. I am she, I'm trans.

I'm not saying it because I have or should to. I want to say it.

Honestly most of the times I've told I haven't liked it. Since not too long ago, I felt like in a confessionary sharing a shameful secret. Yeah, it was a secret, but it's not a sin to be confessed. It should neither be shameful. I'm tired of hiding it, hiding myself.

This is not my life, it's not who I am. I am not a man, nor am I Ivan.

It's not a lifestyle or a choice, or a sickness or a fetish. I'm not a gay man, nor a cross-dresser, nor a tranny. I'm not a cliche nor a joke. I don't wish to turn into gossip.
I'm just me, trying to live how I really feel, comfortable, without shame nor fear, authentic.

I can change how I dress and act and talk and look. There are ways to change even my body. There is no therapy or pill that can change who I really am, I can only hide it. For a long time, even without realizing it, I lived like that, hiding, first from myself and then from the world. I'm sick of feeling invisible.

This is my life, no one is going to live it for me and I should not live it for anyone. I'll dress and act and look how I want, how I please.

I am a transgender woman, yes, but I'm the same person I've always been. Just as I'm from Tijuana, and a psychologist, and I love old books and notebooks, and listen to sad music, and avoid cheese and prefer my coffee bitter... Being trans is just one of the many things that describe me, not something that defines me.

Just as I eventually will stop fully pretending to be Ivan, today I'll stop using this profile. I won't delete the account the same way I can not delete my past.

For whoever wants to support me, or be with me, or just stay in contact, or knowing what's new in my life, Sofia Fernandez will be my new profile. Any comment or question, you know who I am and where to find me.

If I know something it's that my life won't be easy. It will be a long and hard path. Nonetheless, it's unimaginable the relief I feel knowing that I won't have to take it by myself.

Even if just for today, thanks for reading me, for seeing me."

Catherine is not here yet. I've posted it. It's done. No more hesitation or doubt. I'm out, I'm visible.

I am going to open the door.


### 2016-07-23

I did publish it. I left home and got into Catherine's car. I showed her the picture of the notification about the post I was tagged in from Ivan. The notifications started appearing. Even though I had signed out of Ivan's profile, the little boxes kept telling me people commented on a post I was tagged in, and others about the friend requests. I turned off the notifications, of both Facebook and the e-mail.

I kept my head occupied with my date. We ate in Giuseppi's. We ordered a pizza and a salad. I thought I heard one of the girls from the next table say something about my hair as we passed and took our seats. The waiters welcomed us and asked us if we were ready.

Both Miguel and Luis saw me leaving. I didn't wore the black sweater.

After dinner, we walked and took pictures. We played pokemon and had fun. I love her, I really do. I see her face and I want to get close and hug her and kiss her in those full lips. I don't care about anyone's reaction when I'm with her. I feel happy.

I caught glimpses of the notifications. I had 62 friends requests. More than a hundred likes. I was scared it would go unnoticed. I kept it unseen until this morning.

I didn't cry when I read the comments. I didn't know how I would feel. What was I expecting? I read them and see them, and look through the faces and their words, and I felt, warm. It was nice.

There was something, though.

Catherine told me that my hesitation could be about who would not be there. I replied that I wasn't worried about that. The people close to me already knew. There was no one I could think of that I'd miss from there.

Today I realized I was wrong. I saw the faces and accepted the requests and I thought about Valeria, she was there. Omar Moncayo and Rafa, too, they would send me the requests later. Just one person was left from the last picture I saw.

She doesn't have me on Facebook. I deleted her. There is no way she can see it. Do I want her, too?

I wrote a message for her. I made the text I could send her, apologizing, telling her about her mementos.

There is no way I can send it to her. She has not signed in whatsapp in more than a week. I don't have her in any of the two Facebook profiles. Do I want her to read the message? I wrote it and read it and I think is pathetic. What difference is it in there from the other cringing messages I would send her years before?

I made a mistake, maybe. I regret the way I treated her, sure, and what happened. But there is no way a simple message can fix anything.

"A couple of weeks ago I saw you and your boyfriend. I had this ill felling as if I should avoid talking to you or letting you see me, shame of being seen by you or him in a dress. Then I thought that maybe you have seen me before without my noticing. Lots of times I was nervous to think you had to give explanations about me or answering uncomfortable questions. Others I thought probably months passed without you hearing or remembering my name.

I was the one who looked out for you after the weeks and months of silence but it was I, too, who deleted you from Facebook. It wasn't because of hate or resentment. It wasn't so you could not know about me, it was so I could not know about you. With time I would think of you and look for you, I saw your life and it hurt knowing about you.

Some days ago I finally cleaned the box of memories about you. It was something I avoided for a long time. I didn't want to read your notes and letters or see your gifts and mementos. I couldn't deal with the emotions and memories.

It hurt reading about what you felt about me and your promises and cares and then think about what happened.

'She left, she was the only one who left', I would think a thousand times after you told me in October you could not be my friend.

In my anger I never thought about what I did to you. I didn't just leave you, I betrayed you. I showed you a mask and let you fall in love with it. I met you Ivan and tell you his story and secrets, you loved him and learned to need him and invite him to your world. You imagined a future with him. Even if with time you stopped loving him, he once was your best friend. And I took him from you. I took him from your hands and told you he didn't exist.

Why would you want to be my friend? How could I pretend to ask you to stay and see him change and disappearing?

Maybe you needed him or missed him the way I missed and needed you as my best friend. Maybe you found other friends who took his place, I don't know.

I know we don't have any relationship anymore. In a way we were once best friends, but in other we're nothing more than two strangers. A lot of times I thought about sending you the friend request from my new profile as with all the people who knew about me. I never could convince me that it was a good idea. I understand if you want to keep not knowing anything about me. I hope it's not too late, if you already got over or left it all behind, to say it to you:

I'm really sorry. I'm sorry if I hurt you in any way. It was never my intention to betray you or play with you. I regret that you got caught in the middle of everything that happened to me.

PS I have your hairpins and the stamp and box with your name. They're not mine and never were meant for me to have them. I feel wrong keeping them and thought you might want them back.

### 2016-07-24

I did not sent the letter to Monica. In hindsight I am thankful I took that choice. It was the right one. It was another ill-attempt to ease my own conscience attributing all blame to myself and exonerating her from every sin in a begging attempt to not being rejected. It was pathetic.

I took the less obvious choice, no explanations, no apologies. It might look hypocritical, but I don't really regret it. I sent her the friend request and went to sleep. Lot of things happened today, and even yesterday I did more than just that.

I updated my profile picture and cover photo. The former one was the first picture I took from my date with Catherine, looking downsides to my phone in a serious and doubtful expression. "Have I done the right thing?" The latter, on the other hand was a game of shadows. Long legs and dark bodies, two hands in the middle grasping each other. Companionship and love. "By your side the world seems so small and I lose all fear. With you, I feel invincible".

I went to sleep. No, I went to bed.

I don't know how many hours I did rest. Again the thoughts and ideas about a conference got rushed into my mind, as if the possibility of me doing something like that was nearing.

The alarm clock woke up at 5. I killed it before the echo and waited 20 minutes 'till the next one. There was a fainter, younger and weaker one. Like a chorus far far away. I went to shower and get ready. I did not need to shave. The machine, two touches next to my chin were enough. I put my bra after the shower. It's the first time I don't hide it. I wore make up, too, but just a touch, a barely noticeable veil that could hide any trace left of masculinity.

We accompanied Miguel to leave him in the convention center. This time the whole family went. Until now I saw it as the two women going with the three men that went yesterday. Is that really how I see it? Am I closer to my mother, now?

She came down the stairs as I was finishing myself. "are you ready?" she asked casually, without intent nor care. I think I heard her use the feminine form. I could be mistaken. It doesn't matter, though. I felt nothing, no strangeness or cringing or shame, only acceptance.

The border patrol looked at the visas. I put them out of their sleeves so I know the order they were set in. My father's, my mother's, mine and then my siblings'. He looked at the first one saying it's name out loud at the same time his eyes looked for my father. He said the second's name and his eyes went straight to my mother's. When he got to my card, he said in a different inflection. It wasn't of certainty, it was of doubt. He skipped my face and looked at Luis besides me, and then Miguel. I raised my hand and admitted my former name. He looked at me and said nothing. He kept going.

We ate breakfast at Denny's. After then my father took us to the beach. I walked through the rocks crossing the sand into the ocean. I felt the sound of its waves splashing and covering me. I looked at the whiteness of its spume and wanted to get lost in it. I could had kept going, hopping rock to rock until the very end, every slippery step a test of endurance. What would happen when I finally got to the edge? Would it be time to come back or would a final step into the ocean be the perfect ending?

Are these hints of sparks of a suicidal kindle?

No, I know better than that.

More than a hundred people accepted me and looked for me and added me. Words like strong and brave and courageous and admirable. They mean nothing. It's being intelligent all over again. Sometimes I keep feeling like the dumbest imbecile in the whole world. An incompetent fool in charge of a whole universe. I'm weak and cowardly and scared and potentially hated.

Nobody hates me, even though I want more names to add on the list to bury the one, no one seems to dare speak up. Why am I liked?

What do they see that I can't?

I could just ask Monica if she had accepted the request.

I liked a picture of Omar and she was one of the three people who liked the 10 minutes old post. She liked another one.

Should I cancel the request? Or should it die of age in her screen like a white flag rotting over islands of corpses.



### 2016-07-25

Why can't I last more than a fucking week without crying?

The request stayed unanswered and I felt in limbo. Sometimes the falling is way worse than the actual impact. I read the drafted message countless times yesterday an in the morning. It was sent and seen by noon. Just sending it was a relief, the message was delivered, it was her choice to either read it or not. My job was done.

In it I deleted most of the pathetic shit I regretted. I left just enough to feel apologetic and sincere. It was. I wasn't faking, it wasn't an attempt to reconciliation. I looked for her forgiveness. I guess I will never have it.

I feel this whole range of emotions just now.

She did answer. Is the impact really less painful to the time I fell? It's bee hit by hit. I had problems with guilt. I know I wasn't a monster. Why do I fee... No, I don't feel like one. I won't let her do this to me again. I apologized, she didn't.

I feel this urge to keep crying, to scream to a pillow. This past months it was the feeling of rejection but now it's because I deserved it? What is it that I do? What was my so big mistake?

I would prefer greatly that it was because of me.

"do you still doubt that you hurt me?"

Was it the time she returned from France? The request of my book back. Does it even matter?

She was no blameless victim, either. I can twist the story and play the martyr. That's what I've done my whole life. At least now I can leave it like this. Embrace the guilt for a while. If she can't or won't, I can forgive myself.

Should I throw back blame? Should I say something? Anything? Is staying quiet not the same thing Ivan did with her?

No, it truly doesn't matter. It won't change a thing. Her mind about my blame won't change. I'll forget her, eventually, maybe?

Her hate...

"I'm perfectly, I just don't want you looking for me anymore. Honestly, it's not your change, is that independently of whatever you are, it doesn't change the fact that you behaved like an asshole with me."

It was a swift and straight stab. The blade felt cold and it slide like into butter. A quick and firmly shock of pain titillating across my whole body. It's not because it's true, it's not because it came from her, it's because what my guilt had always said. It's the echo of the sadistic voice that keeps me from sleeping.

I hope, with time, I can remember this and see it in a different light.

Even thought the whole conversation was said as if I were two different people, I'm not. Ivan's mistakes and rights were mine. I wasn't another person, I was a younger and naiver one. I've grown, I've changed, and I'll continue to do so. I was right, I can't do anything to change what happened. I took responsability and apologized. I'll give her her things back, inside the box I'll give her the half keychain with her name in it and the date.

It contradicts herself, when she both says I took her best friend mercilessly from her, and yet says it wasn't about the change but how I behaved?

It's her problem. I know what I did and what I feel guilty about.

It's done. It's done.

No, the relationship is done, although it had ended for years. The friendship is done, although it ended for months. There is nothing left but memories, those nobody will take from me, not even her. But why do they hurt me so much?

I feel the fresh tears rolling and falling on my neck. Will there be wet spots in my tank? Will they leave a mark on my skin like the acid they feel like?

Can I ask my brother and mother to delete her? Why?

I won't look for her anymore, like she wants. I don't want to, either. Why does it hurt? Why did her words were like a twist to the hitting dagger?

"Ok", I ended the conversation. Everything was said. She insulted me. She said what she had to say and I delivered my message. This is closure... Another one. The definitive one.

Can I ask her to take her phantom back? Can I let her know about it?

Can it be killed?

### 2016-07-26

It was a hard night indeed. I wrote the words after Monica's messages. "You were like an asshole to me".

I cried like I hadn't cried in a lot, even for now that I'm under the hormone regimen. I talked with Catherine even though I didn't really want to. I felt like thrash. Guilty as fuck. It hurt that I had lost my best friend because of something I didn't choose nor control, it seemed unfair. And it hit me, a different outcome. It wasn't, honestly, my change, it was my behaviour, my actions... It was indeed, my fault. I lost her.

I was enraged, but was it with myself or her? Her first messages had this hostile subtext, like a tasteless and odorless poison very well hidden. It was distant and cold, like a therapist trying to uncover the truth with loaded questions.

"Do you still doubt that you hurt me?"

After I answered them defensively and truthfully I asked her, a counter-attack, "Is that all you're going to say?". She hid her dagger and gave me a well meaning and sugary speech about how she wishes me the best and not any evil, it's good I live now like I want to, I got what I want, and I don't have to hide anymore.

I could spend hours trying to analyze her messages, follow the traces of her hits looking for her wounded scars. But what's the point, really? I did took screenshots of the messages, but by now they're deleted, just as the conversation.

I made the mistake of continuing. Talking a little about me, a little about my feelings and guilt. It took her out of her preparedness. Her poison was uncovered. Her hits were dirty, until she finally told the truth.

"I'm perfectly, I just don't want you to look for me anymore" That hurt almost as much as her insult. Was she defending herself against the accusation of intolerance? "It's not about your change, I don't care what (what, not who, what) you are, you behave like an asshole to me".

It doesn't fit. In her arranged speech she prefaced the reason about not being my friend utilizing my own apology: "like you said, you took my best friend mercilessly from me, I can't be your friend." So I both took Ivan from her, as changing, and, at the same time, whomever I was behaved like an asshole.

My actions, whatever they were, are worse than her previous ex, whom she's utilizing as a courier of her things. He "cheated" on her. They were in a 'relationship' and he was seeing another girl. They're still friends. I was an asshole. Ok.

Am I rationalizing, now? Excusing myself because of the guilt?

I cried almost the whole time from finishing the words until falling asleep. I didn't just delete the conversation and canceled the request. I blocked her from Facebook, I deleted her contact from my phone.

I woke up by the early six and took pills for my headache. I grabbed her pictures and notes, my zippo and a white plate. I sat outside and burned the stuff. First it was the cardboard bookmark with song lyrics and a message. It curled and grayed like an aging head of an old man. Then it were some pictures, the one from the ride in Universal Studios. The one were we played in a garden fence in high school. The little yellow bird from Snoopy that she made me. The little notes. Everything burned and turn to ashes.

Does it still count if I have it on video?

I've seen it a couple of times, the faces disintegrating, the words "always yours" "I love you" "always your little bird" fading away and turning into dust.

I sent a message to Valeria asking her if she knew something about me. She did see the profile a couple days before, thought it was a cousin that look incredibly like me, she even showed it to Omar.

That's what she say, at least. Who knows.

Does it matter? How many people had seen the profile and thought similarly? People on the street would see me like that and think I look amazingly like Ivan? Does that mean they see a woman? Should I be proud?

Then not coming out would be staying hidden. People would never find me and relate to me. Not unless they clicked and got in.

I thought about asking her about Monica. I decided not to. I should delete her from everything in my life.

Tomorrow I must not forget the box.

"You throw away the stuff

We both were assholes

I apologized -Sofia"




### 2016-07-27

Almost forgot to write today's words. I was already lying in bed and put my pillow over my eyes. I'm tired.

I went to the beach. I put the alarm clock to wake me up near 10. Yesterday night I spent it chatting with Valeria. I asked her if she had known something about me before I came out. She had seen the profile, but thought it was a cousin of mine. After those kinds of questions and stories, I told her parts of mine. I explained the hormones and its uses and then my sexual orientation. It was nice, talking with someone different, having a new perspective of things. It's freeing this new feeling of liberty and openness.

I played with Luis a little in the wii just moments ago.

He just entered the room trying to tell me a new gossip. He opened the door and exclaimed "Ivan... I mean Sofia, sorry, it slipped... today my mother dropped two dishes of the green ones"

I heard it. I had finished showering and was getting ready to leave for therapy. I put my shorts and a blouse with the long tail. The white bra underneath it. I look feminine enough.

Catherine sent me a message that she would accompany her mother to some places. 20 minutes before I had to leave, she sent me another one that she was near bissu. I could pick her up and she would come with me to therapy. I did. I left and picked her up. Did her mom see me? Did I look feminine? Like a girl?

We walked to Rene's and stop in an Oxxo in the way.

"Sometimes I feel like the other one"... I asked her to never say that. She's not the other one and she wasn't. As Ivan I knew myself with her. We went to the hotel days after I broke up with Monica, yeah, but we didn't go with the intention of doing nothing sexual. We were going just to exchange clothes, try it out, experiment a little.

I try remembering, not months ago, years. The first times I broke up with Monica it was so hard for the days to pass without talking. It was months before the last message. Another couple of days just passed.

In session I talked about Monica and my public announcement. I asked my mother for change, to break me a bill of 500. She saw me with the clothes and make up. She said nothing about it, but as I left, she made no mention of son or Ivan.

With Rene I thought of the possibility that my own transformation is a trigger to Monica's own sexuality issues. Maybe she likes me, she's attracted to me as a girl, too. That would be terrifying and confusing. She wanted to try it, and when she did, she wanted to do it again. Later when I asked her she said no. But the times of silence were because of me. In October it was because it was weird that I referred to myself as a woman. I asked her to respect me, to not tell me I looked like a freak. Maybe she was just trying to convince herself I looked bad.

In Spain she asked me to not send pictures.

It sounded very defensive her statement that it was not because of my change, it was because I behaved like an asshole. As if it were a reason to not like me.

It's not my problem. It doesn't change shit.

I won't benefit from her friendship. It's better to just let her go.

We walked back to the car and Catherine told me she thought about it, too, but decided to say nothing. We drove and met with the gang in the park near the beach. Paola just said hi and then left. She had her first patient. Chevo left, too, to pick his car.

We chatted and talked, both in the pizzeria and the beach. We bought chips and water and then a clamato with beer. The guy in there asked us for our ids. He grabbed mine and even covered my name with his finger. He saw the picture and return it. He barely glanced at it. I was relieved. Everyone talked about their parents and even I shared.

I don't have problems with them. They're accepting and trusting. My father didn't rush me to get a job, my mother does not make an issue about my leavings.

I am fortunate.

Luis told me it's possible that my grandma might come friday. Will she say something? Will I talk with her?

Will she call me Sofia? This Saturday my mom will go with my godmother to the vineyard. Will I dare to ask her what she said? Why would I want to know?

### 2016-07-28

I should start the words now. I don't know what to talk about. My grandmother came from Mexicali. My parents left to pick her up from the bus station. I was playing Mario Kart with Luis. I was in the bathroom, drowning in sweat, when they return. For a moment I didn't know what to expect. They asked for me but said Ivan. I came down and she hugged and kissed me. She told me my aunt sent me a hug, too. Was it because of my post? They have not forgotten.

I don't have to hide it. I can just live it. They'll follow my lead.

Luis today started saying it more and more, even to my mother. I just needed to start referring myself as I want. Will I dare to do it in front everybody?

My face is changed. It's smoother and softer. My beard is almost unnoticeable.

Yesterday Paola reminded us of going out Saturday night. I was a little excited. It would not be like the last time when it turned sour after Catherine's ill-feeling and Anahi's lack of taste of beer.

This time it's supposed to be all of us. The seven. When I asked Catherine about the clothes I could wear, she asked and then continued saying she doubted she would go. She doesn't have much money and neither much will. I felt disappointed. I did, I wanted to.

After talking I was convinced it was going to end up awkwardly awful, too. Anahi didn't know that there was going to be all of us. She would be separated and down. She would stay with me and Catherine feel estranged.

If she didn't go, there was no point in me going alone.

When I hear my name, Catherine is the only that I truly believe.

I asked Miguel for the game of Pokemon and to borrow his game boy sp. They're ready, next time that I see Catherine, I can give it to her. We can both start the game at the same time. The first generation of pokemon. Almost 20 years ago. I remember being in the church lectures and staying with Edgar and Jessica, seeing him play, talk about it.

Today both of them added me on Facebook.

Jessica posted the picture of her take of protest. She's officially a nutriologist. I liked her picture. Was it with that intention? No, it took me by surprise. Moments after that I received her notification. I accepted without delay. I received then an explanation, a message. She accepts me and wishes me the best. Hopefully accepting myself (feminine) will let me blossom to my full potential... or something like that.

Even though she has known me almost all of our life, she realized you always learn something new from your friends.

That's true. She was my best friend, for years, for a lot longer than Monica. Jessica left, too. No, she didn't leave. We both drifted apart, our families did. We shared our childhood. We played games in both our houses. We played videogames and watched television and went to theme parks and even shared beds. We playfully called each other siblings. It was really nice and I had forgotten about it. No, I did remember, just, didn't have it present.

I was so busy thinking in the 5? 6 years? that I shared with Monica, that I forgot about the decade that I shared with her. She was, in a way, my first kiss. She wasn't a romantic love, but a fraternal one. A puerile and innocent one. We held hands sometimes, we saw each other cry. She saw me lots of times more than I did her. We met in preschool and shared the 6 years of elementary. We were in the same jr high the first year, and the same class the rest. We graduated and went to the same high school and were just friends, acquaintances. After her I met Monica. Did they ever meet?

Yes. Once.

Just like Catherine and Monica did.

Catherine and Jessica were in the same class the first year of high school. They were not friends, just acquaintances. Like we the two years before.

I talked with Diana. Would I dare talk to her again? Try to reach out, ask how her life is, remembering like I'm doing right now.

In high school I felt isolated. I took myself out of every social circle I ever pertained.

I only needed Monica, I was convinced. Now she's really gone, I should let myself open up. Reach out to those people who were close.

Maybe tomorrow, maybe next week.

Perhaps.

### 2016-07-29

I was in bed chatting with Catherine. We talked about tomorrow, were we going to go sell, would we go in the evening? Should we take a uber or should I ask my dad for a ride? Luis got in the room and sat in my chair, the conversation was showing in the monitor. Somehow the conversation turned into a different path.

"Luis calls you Sofia"

Seconds later, Luis said: "I try, to, sometimes I get confused".

What?

I saw him sitting in the chair turning one side to the other. Everything came together. Sofia, Dofia. He sees me. He comes and goes with the masculine and feminine.

It gets awkward and uncomfortable sometimes. What would my parents say? Why would they say something? Everybody knows.

My grandmother came yesterday after everyone was in their room. She hugged me while I was in bed. She kissed my cheek and assured me that nothing would change between us. She would always love me and adore me, and I would always be her little one. She hugged me again and finished saying that Edgar, as well, asked her to hug me in his part.

Everyone is accepting and loving. Today my cousin Charly added me and sent me a text message saying he would support me.

I can't help but feel surprised. Everybody was supposed to be prejudiced and irrational? Where are all those people who comment hateful stuff on the internet? Where are the people that would mock me or push me away?

I know they are somewhere. Medrano, Alan, they were some of my closest friends. Other people from highschool and jr high. People from the family. More distant ones, sure. I don't miss them.

Tomorrow I'll wear a dress and ask my dad to drive me. What if he says something? What could he say?

I did not start the conversation with Jessica. Tomorrow my Mom will go with her mother. I told my mom I would go and sell the clothes I took out of my closet. I made no mention about my abhorrence to them or my wish to refill it.

She might intuit it, but I have to say it. No, I want to say it. Not this weekend. Tomorrow I'll go sell with my girlfriend.

I'll go make her company. When she told me the things I should take I felt anxious. I felt useless and incompetent. I could not stand beside her and sell stuff, I could not attend people coming and asking questions. I wished not to go. I could just go and put the bag in the donation box outside the neighborhood.

She told me to go. She could sell them and I would just make her company. I was relieved but at the same time, uneasy.

It's fine. I can let her have all of the gains.

It's hot. The summer has come with its full blaze. The fan is turning spitting its air to the room, but it's not enough. I showered already and dressed in loose shorts and a thin tank. My body is changing and it looks weird now in this attire. My breasts are small but noticeable. My nipples are pointy and extremely sensitive.

Tomorrow I'll wear shorts and a blouse to the swap meet. I'll return and shower and get ready. I thought about wearing the gray dress. I told Catherine matter-of-factly I would not wear the blue one. "I'm going to wear the sleeve-less gray one, the first one you gave to me. I've worn the blue a lot" She told me it was fina, I had a point.

Later I mentioned I planned on putting on the red tights. "Yes?", she asked. I tried to sound sure and convinced and confirmed myself.

I failed in my bluff and later confessed my worry: "you think I'll look bad, right?" She has a point, she doesn't like them. She prefers the other dress. The gray one is really short and the colored tights are noticeable. What if I look bad or grab too much attention to myself?

She said that no, she had not thought that.

I saw a picture of three years ago when we were in the Finances building, at the top floor, sitting. I had my hair longish for a man but comparably way shorter than now. I had a black scarce beard and mustache that framed the white-teethed smiled I showed the camera. I was broad but not fat nor big. I looked strong. There was some melancholy hidden in my small eyes. She was sitting besides me, smiling. Her eyes framed in black and her closed smile glowing.

That was the day Chevo and Jessica met us there and we changed shoes.

It was when she liked Ivan. She liked him like that. I looked good.

"We made a cute straight couple, just as we make a cute lesbian one now"

### 2016-07-30

I was with Catherine, sitting in the stand she put herself in front of the house that lends her the space. The clothes were lying on the floor over two sheets extended. There were some coats and dresses hung. Besides most of the clothes were the masculine clothes I took. Besides them a filled suitcase with the cheapest of all.

I took the game boys so we could play in the dead time. We chatted, too. Some people approached us and called us girls. A couple of times I took both of our phones and walked around the block to incubate my pokemon Go eggs and see if I could find a new one. I gave three rounds. The first one was the shortest, just uphill and return from where I had parked in the first place, before I moved the car near Catherine's. The second one was the longest, I went to the other side and looked at the other stands and what they offered. A couple of people maintained their eyes on me, as if there was something weird. I kept walking, as if I had not noticed as if I did not care.

I returned a couple minutes later when the stench of the food and cheap stuff was too much to bear and the halls seemed to become narrower.

The last one was similar to the first but to the second block. There were some dogs so I changed streets. I had Catherine's iphone in my shorts back pocket. Mine I grabbed firmly in the palm of my hand. I noticed the two kids hanging by their fence before they saw me. The street was empty so their first call as "sir", hurt me. I kept walking as if I had not hear or didn't identified to the call. I don't know if it was the same one or the other one that tried again: "Girl"... I was a couple of steps ahead of them so I turn my head and faced them. I smiled subtly ceding them my attention. I can't remember which one was first. One asked me to approach them, and the other just said "Would you give me a kiss?". I smiled openly but shaked my head. I kept on walking. The one who asked me to approach them seemed mad, a little disappointed, perhaps? What was his intention, maybe he wanted to see me closer, maybe he wanted to tell me straight to my face. Would he nicer had I agreed?

"With that face you look like a man!"

I was perplexed. I kept walking. So, I had a manly face. Was it the smile? Was it the lack of make up? He talked about my face. Maybe they saw my breasts or smooth legs.

He said I looked like a man. As if I were not. I am not. So was he validating in his obnoxious and bratty way?

I was doubtful after that.

We left a couple of minutes shy of noon. We stopped in a Chinese restaurant and order a lunch for the two of us. Nobody turned at us and nobody made any faces. The waitress welcomed us without any mention of gender. The only thing was the face of the bill going straight at me. Was it a sign? Was it just the insecurity awaken because of the two brats?

Some minutes ago, my grandmother's shadow tapped my shoulder from the door. I turned as she approached closer, with the intention of saying something. Was it going to be like when I arrived and she talked with me some minutes about the food she prepared and the chores she did and the spiders she found. "Luis came to me yesterday with his phone and told me 'look, nana, what Sofia posted about me'. She said the name and it felt weird but not in a bad way. Like a scurry tingling crawling in my veins all the way from my fingers to my heart.

It wasn't. This time was more direct. She came as close as she could and asked me straight to my face. "Sofi? Do I call you Sofi, my love?...
 I was dumbfound. I smiled automatically. It was an autonomous response to an unregistered stimulus. She said it again, and this time it made perfect sense and I was able to answer mutedly. I nodded with the most shy eyes I've ever showed. She confirmed it as she hugged and kiss my cheek. It's going to be hard to get use to, but I'll be Sofi, her love.

And I thought I smiled like an idiot when the gas dispatcher called me "miss" twice as I left, even after hearing my voice.

I should be getting ready to this night out.

### 2016-07-31

I left the room just like that other time. Miguel and Luis were downstairs like the last one. I hid my legs behind the kitchen counter, although my torso and face were completely visible. I opened my red lips and asked him if we were going to pick up my mom. He replied with the question of what time I had accorded of meeting my friends.

Miguel was going to stay. Luis stood up and I saw his intention of going with us. I felt relief. I wanted to hug him and thank him. Were we going to pick my mom before? Would she see me?

My father said no more words to me in all the trip until we got there. He told me to take care. I thanked him and got off. I sat in front of the fountain, waiting for the rest. There was a girl with earphones and net tights. I glanced a couple of times at her. Was she alone like me? How wasn't she bothered?

Catherine and Anahi came together. They were the first to arrive. We sat where I was for a couple of minutes. They talked about pokemon and I felt as lonely as before. I was a little hurt by my father's avoiding eyes and his scalding silence.

We went ahead to El Tigre and sat in the table next to the entrance. We were going to order when Paola S arrived. A couple of minutes later, Paola A got to us.

It was a fun night, we talked and laughed. I felt comfortable in my clothes, in my skin. In every bar we were asked for our ids and yet nobody made even a face with mine. They kept gendering me correctly. I used the ladies' bathroom in the last bar where we smoked hookah. Paola told us about her break up. Anahi was the first one to leave. The rest of us left at the same time.

The first bar was El Tigre, we drank a liter each. I finished Anahi's. From there we went to Zenzontle. We drank pulque and Paolas, beer. I tried some of the nachos. I bared the cheese. We accompanied Anahi to the crossing strip and then returned to the hookah bar.

We took our respective ubers. Everybody was awake her, it was early still. Luis was with me in my room. It was weird the sensation of taking my clothes. A week ago I would do it without a second thought. Now, he said something about my breasts how he saw me flat when I left but there he thought how good for me and that the hormones were doing its thing. "Of course I don't mean anything, you are my sister"

Today we were in my bed when they returned from the park. First was Luis with me and then my mother came an lied between us. We talked about our phones and pokemon and stuff in general. I could notice in the earrings she had in her hands and the couple of tries of sending Luis away that she wanted to tell me something. Finally, after my grandma called her a couple of times, she showed me the earrings. "They are hand-crafter of a white and red stone, do you like them?" She handed them to me and I looked at them. I smiled shyly. "For whom?" "Well, for you?" I felt uncomfortable and vulnerable, I shake my head without erasing the smile. I handed them back without any malice. She laughed. "They're long? How do you like them?" I started my answer when she completed them herself: "You don't have earholes!" She laughed out loud and said she could do them herself. She asked my grandmother. "For whom?" "For Sofia".

They sat at the table and even though I am not really hungry, I sat and ate with them. I asked my mother about Norma. She started saying how Jessica (I wrote an M... as if I were going to write another name) was thinking about getting breast implants.

Then continued about me. Hormones, maybe she could take the same and get some growth.

"she's been trying to change the way she addresses me. She wakes in the morning and says to herself that's going to be the day she calls me Sofia. Ivan comes out instead. I don't blame her. I don't even blame my dad for answering her when they were at the beach and she asked him for him to say that I would always be Ivan to him.

I get it.

"I see her and I see Ivan, wearing Ivan clothes, It's been so many years and it's hard." That's the reason she asked me about shoes and clothes later that day.

She was upset that I had not told her about posting it. It was impulsive after long moments of hard consideration. I did what I had to do.

Norma read it a couple of times. She was perplexed, she did not what to say. Would she call, send a message? Would she comment there or add me?

My uncles contacted my mom this last week to show her their support. My grandma told my mom, and made her cry, her eyes got misty as she recalled it, how that same day of the post, both of my uncles and Fernando, their friend, reunited by the pool to drink, tall, and even cry?

My future, my life, how I've been living. All of our lives, my whole family, how would my dad take it?

How could I bare living like these all those years.

My godmother asked the same question, how could I excel at so many things and be a perfect student and feel as lonely as ever, with these emotions for so many years?

And I thought for a long time I had no reason to cry.

How do things change.

## August, 2016

### 2016-08-01

Today came upon me as a heavy rock pushing me towards bed.

I postponed the alarm clock several times until time itself moved me and screamed directly in my ear. Catherine woke up in the breaking dawn to get ready for her first day in this semester of adult school. I kept wrestling with the dreariness of a new day.

Yesterday I showered shortly after Catherine's last message. I shaved for today's session. I exited my room and my grandma offered to make me breakfast. I accepted. Is this a better mood after her support and love? Is it guilt of the baseless resentment I had towards her?
After eating I showered and got ready. I tied and upped my hair in a modest bun behind my head. I wore man's jeans and a t-shirt with nothing underneath. I like the feeling of incongruence between my little more delicate body and this boxy clothes of the past.

I looked at my thighs squeezing themselves into the skinny legs of the pants. The cotton fabric embracing them. The shy curves that barely show halfway between my knees and my waist. My nipples are more sensitive than ever. The touch of the skin of my arm is enough to make me flinch.

My mother sent me to buy her some pastry and a bag of ice. I stopped in the oxxo but they ran out of bags. I returned home. I could bring the bag after coming from the laser session. This is the last paid one. Five sessions since April. Did the first session was before I started hormones? The technician welcomed me and confirmed it was the last one. She asked me if I had worn any kind of cream. Neither she nor the other had ever asked me that before. Did my skin look different? Maybe it's smoother and clearer. I can see my own face when I gaze into my reflection.

It was both less and more painful. There are lots of zones where there are not any single trace of hair. The cheeks and neck were just uncomfortable. As she went closer to the chin the pain started to increase. The last half of the upper lip had me in tears. The glasses were different. A piece of tissue under two lenses in the shape of half grapes. I missed the older googles. I imagined I was underwater, holding my breath and drowned of any sound of the world.

5 minutes. I lasted more going there than I did inside. I returned home with the bag of ice I bought in the gas station. I told a little about my session to my grandma. Does it hurt? Yeah, it does.

I thought about the comment my mother did. My godmother told her to ask me where do I go. Jessica has gone to a place for her mustache, but it has not worked. When I started to type the thought, the first letter it appeared was an M.

My grandmother seemed excited and smiled as if this were some big breakthrough. I mean, yeah, I guess it is. It was so 4 months ago when I started. Last year I dreaded shaving in the morning and having to worry about the shadow that would show in the evening. It was like a mark that would signal my fake status.

Now I take it for granted. I've been gendered female in shorts and t-shirt. I've been gendered female without any make up. Did I even shave before going to the swap meet?

I saw the last episode of the series Preacher. And the new episode of Mr Robot. It was hard to concentrate. When Catherine returned from her day in class she showed me her progress in Pokemon Go. I felt uneasy. What was it? I felt trapped. I went out, I showered and changed and got out. It's not like I'm always here. Two nights ago I was outside in a dress, shoulders bare and lips as red as my tights. I posted the video and pictures and my mother and family and even Maru liked them. I can show myself to the world. Why am I not ecstatic?

My mother made a comment today that between women there is no fight or something like that. Luis referred to me as her a couple of times.

Everybody said Ivan, though. I can't blame them. I guess I even blamed myself, dressing in this androgynous clothes and continuing in this faÃƒÂ§ade.

I can meet Catherine after her class and go shopping, I can ask my mother about going and looking for clothes.

Why would she not come with me? Would she be hurt that I'd prefer going with Catherine than her? She bought me earrings and I denied them.

Would I be comfortable? Why not?

### 2016-08-02

It's come again. I feel it right here over me, a dull and gray cloud dropping dry droplets of smoke.

Even finding the words is tiring. Are this just effects of the medication? Lack of them?

I am sad, I am tired. I feel like crying and lying in bed.

The whole day I've been hearing him, son, and Ivan. Even when my grandma came and acknowledge it she repeated it twice to my like making an emphasis to their mistakes. Luis corrects himself. It's not the mistake, I've always understood it's going to be something hard. It just hurts.

Tomorrow I have therapy again. I'll see him again and I can talk about this, about what has happened. The coming and words of my grandma. The talk with my mother about the weekend, the lying in my bed and the earrings, the going out to drinks and showing the id, my asking my dad for a ride and facing his silence.

My uncles gathered and talked about my loss. Ivan's departure. For a lot I used to wonder what would it be knowing how would people react after my dead. Isn't this what I wanted?

People keep adding me on the new Facebook. Every new request is a new name to the list of people who feels fine with my existence, everyone who has forgiven me for killing him.

I feel the pressure of their misnaming. It's because the clothes I wear, the way I speak. She say it herself: she saw me as Ivan for years and she sees me as him and wearing his clothes.

I don't dare to come and ask her or even telling my intentions of changing the way I look.

I never, ever, asked them the change the way the refer to me. Is that why I am crying? Because it was their own initiative and apparently it's not enough?

Will I leave Rene? Will I stop going to therapy? Should I talk to him about it? I should mention it.

I haven't reached the half and I'm tired. I haven't done the exercise for weeks and I feel exhausted. I want to leave the house but I don't have patients nor a job. i haven't updated the resume nor send it to anyone in months. I haven't started with the powerpoint presentations about the supposed course I could give.

I just lie in bed to dream or escape.

I want time to go faster. I want the changes to be more obvious. I want to no longer see him in the mirror. I want them to stop recognizing him in my eyes.

Today's tuesday. It's hard for me even realizing what day of the week it is. It seems like everyone I know has found a job and continued their life. To them, I changed sex. I found myself and started living happily and truthfully and authentic. At least that's what they said.

What would be worse? Their words being empty vessels of air or me being an impostor? I'm not happy, I;m not honest and I'm not authentic. I'm a melancholic, piece of shit.

I'm too hard on myself. What is it that I can't forgive me for?

Zayra had a point. I was a kid and I did the best I could do. I'm a grown person now. I'm doing the best I can.

The call me brave for what I dare to do. For telling them. Almost everyone who heard me made me think I was making a huge mistake. Were they right?

Would I be crying here right now if they weren't? Rene's been telling me for months to wait until I am ready. Ready to go out, ready to start hormones, ready to tell my parents or my brothers or anyone.

But I never was ready. I was scared shitless the first time I was in the car changing my clothes and even more the first time I felt a pair of eyes setting its gaze upon me. I could not make the phone call to set the appointment. I had to call the next day, and even then, although I never would admit it, I did use the three months of waiting as a time to make myself used to the idea.

Every time I've said it, it has been easier. But it has never been painless. The words cut me like razorblades as they pass through my throat and slice my mouth.

I stand there, with my mouth bleeding and my heart exposed, handed to them, and my eyes begging for mercy.

### 2016-08-03

"Sofi", my mom called me from outside my room, her voice coming from the kitchen. I went from my bed and faced her. She asked me to open her bottle of white wine. She drank half of a little glass and I three quarters of a small beer glass. My grandmother asked just two sips in a shot glass. She was the last one to finish it. I took the last gulp like I did them in Spain. I feel like when I was in there, except that I don't. I am trans, I am Sofia, a woman. I like who I am. I don't need to hide, anymore.

I'm a little tired and have a humming pain in the lower back.

I had my phone with me when I was sitting in the dinning table with the rest of my family, just talking about everything and anything. Cynthia was the one who published the post. It was publicity for the opening of a sexology master from the institute of sexology in Mexico. Could I apply there? How would I pay for it and maintain myself? Why do I keep thinking about failure, about the impossibility of overcoming the obstacles, not reaching the goal.

They are the same kind of thoughts I had before applying to the abroad program. I was never truly convinced I would go even until the day before actually leaving to the airport. Will this be like that? That was the hardest and painfuller and most beautiful and significant time of my life. I was born there. I let myself become. I was going to write it was the culmination of Ivan's life, but that's not true. It was the nexus between ours both.

I got into the page of the institute and read the convocatory of their short stories contest. It has to do with sexuality and its themes. I want to apply. Sure, they ask for an ID, but I cant tell them both my real and legal name. What could I write about? A trans girl like me? A lesbian couple meeting and falling in love? A young girl coming into her own sexuality?

A group of teenagers in a party, playing truth or dare, a bunch of short stories interconnecting themselves about the different matices of sexuality.

I have lots of ideas, would any of them be actually good? I have both time and ideas and intention. I should keep to it and actually try.

I woke up and ate breakfast and showered and left for therapy. My mother gave me the money without asking. I shaved even though it was hard on my skin and the black dots were as aggressive and visible as after the first session. I tried to tamed them with the make up. It was acceptable. My confidence was the most important factor.

I showed myself to them. I wore tapered jeans and a white tank top. The outline of the bra was almost screaming. My long red shirt was open and flowing besides the pair of small breasts. I walked towards Rene playing with my phone. I noticed no suspicious eyes, nothing. I walked just fine, by myself. Rene was alone when I got in. He received me and the session flowed smoothly. He made notice of the gift of my mother. The earrings were symbolic to my birth as a daughter. When a girl is born she receives earrings as gifts. The perforation of the earlobes is one of the earliest rituals. She gave them to me recognizing me as a woman, she handed them to me as a gesture of validation. She even forgot that I do not have the holes. She offered them to me and even invited my grandmother. A three generation feminine ritual of welcoming. And I denied it.

Exiting the parking lot the old man who received my ticket, gendered me as miss as he let me out. I bought the bag of ice that my mother asked me for and drove home.

When I put them in the fridge, my grandmother got closed and said to me secretly-like "your mother told me, open the door, 'Sofia arrived, she's knocking the door'". Just that was the theme with Rene. Her mention of it, the later one today, just bolded the idea I had.

It's my fault for dressing as a boy and wearing his clothes.

When my mom came down, she asked me directly: "When are we going to buy clothes?... Where are we going to buy them?"

She printed a picture of me with my name under it. The first profile picture I posted of me with the purple sweater and a made up smile.

Why? For what?

### 2016-08-04

The same familiar pain in the back is here again. Did I write about it yesterday?

I woke up with it. I felt it in the night while I was dreaming. At first it was just an inconvenience, then, when I was lying in the couch, a thunder of pain struck me just in the back, someone struck the wrong string in my back. Now it's less, a bad memory of this very day.

Catherine has answered my messages. She asks me about my back pain, is it strong? Will it impede to going out tomorrow?

Earlier today I confirmed with Luis tomorrow's plans. I asked him if he was sure. I told my mom, too. She just came a while ago to confirm the invitation was serious. Am I really going to take him with us? Sure. She called him just moments ago to give him the money, "for going out with Sofia".

She's trying.

When I got up and made my breakfast she was ready for going out. My grandmother asked her about it. She was going to the bank, the one close to the hospital. I thought about it, my pills are running out. The antibaby ones will be over next week. I asked her if I could give her the money and she could buy them for me. "Let's go, then".

I showered and tamed my hair. Seeing the shadow of my beard made me feel uneasy. I shaved yesterday. It was hard on my skin. I could not do it again and then later tomorrow, as well. I just put on my clothes and gave a second pass with the razor machine. This time I put on all my clothes in the bathroom, even the bra. I've been wearing it all day. It can be seen through the armholes of my tank top. All the clothes I wore today were man's. All but my underwear. The shirt, the pants, the hoodie, even the tennis. I didn't put on any make up.

What was I expecting? This happened before. Three months ago I shaved barely with a machine and wore just man's clothes and went to the blood lab to be surprised about being seen as a man.

In the bank nobody talk to me, nobody maybe even saw me.

When we got into the pharmacy, my mother ordered the sandwiches and the beverages. The four of us were in front of the cashier, but just her and me walked towards the counter of the pharmacy. This time the clerk addressed me: "I can attend you, gentleman" she said nicely.

It was a punch in the gut. I handed her my script by the name of Sofia and asked for "just the Diane", the anti-conceptive pills for woman. My mother handed her car and I gave her the money. Nobody said nothing to me. She made some comments about giving the change with the cashier but it was more awkward than uncomfortable.

We returned but just she and my grandma ate.

After Luis and my grannie left the table I asked her about the plans for this weekend. Miguel has plans, maybe, doesn't he? She wanted to go to the United States. Have I thought about if I want to buy clothes? And where?

I said the usual "I don't know" and then continued with some history. The places I've been with Catherine are Target and Ross. I've gone to Old Navy, too. And the outlets in the Las Americas Plaza. She said how some of her friends buy clothes in Ross, too. And something about a store where everything costs 5 dollars of something like that.

Was it before or after I told her I have no money? She told me she asked me because she could come with me, or maybe I could go with Catherine or something. She then mentioned how much would be 10,000 pesos. A little more than 500 dollars.

Would I really buy that much? Do I really want to?

I want to have enough clothes, I want to have a choose of what to wear. But at the same time, it bothers me the idea of committing to this body. I expect it to change. I expect it to narrow some places and get wider on others. I don't want to be seen as a gentleman no matter the clothes I wear or if I'm wearing make up or not.

I did not tell her it makes me uncomfortable looking for clothes with them.

We just let it at that we could go this weekend and just look around, see if I like something. I feel almost the same pressure of actually sending Palomino the message to set the meeting and talk about make up.

Those are things I want, that would be good. Why do they make me this nervous?

...

I walked with Luis to the Oxxo, today. I caught several pokemon that he couldn't because he had ran out of pokeballs. After paying, the cashier made some friendly comments about the bags. Exiting, there was a homeless-looking guy who opened the door for us. I handed him the coin I had in my hands. He said: "thanks, friend (feminine)"

I preferred writing about the woman in the pharmacy rather than the guy outside the oxxo. Why do I prefer to remember the things that make me sad?


### 2016-08-05

"Take this, you will go to the Mall, if you see something you like, you can buy it", she handed me several folded bills. It was 25 hundred pesos.

That was just before leaving. I exited the door and Luis was behind me. "Just don't get mad if they said "hey, beauty", being outside I pretended like I had not heard. "Why are you telling me?" "Because you're going with Sofia".

I felt a little like that other time. Coming from the shower I put on firstly the white dress I wore for the pride. I changed into the red leggings and the white blouse. Something in the reflection I did not like. I kept hearing the words of the pharmacist. Even after shaving and the make up and being sure it did not showed, I kept seeing the shadow over my lip.

I took a picture and asked for Catherine opinion. Both outfits were ok. I could use whichever I felt more comfortable in.

She had a point. I had showered my whole body to be in leggings. I decided to wear the white dress. I was all ready and yet I did not want to open the door. Both my mother and grandma had never seen me in person in a dress. What could they say? Would they make a comment? Even a compliment would upset me, but why?

She gave me the money. Maybe tomorrow we will go to the other side of the border. We drove towards Catherine's home.

I've returned from eating a taco. I was sitting in the table with everyone home. We talked. Should I change my voice even with them? The subtle changes I do with Rene or the more drastic ones like when I order something?

Do people notice the weirdness in my voice? The dispatcher from that other time gendered me female even after speaking.

I got distracted again. Catherine shared a picture from when we walked towards the museum and gardens. She tagged both my brother and me. I saw the people who have liked the photo. From there I scrolled to the new posts. One of them was a picture from the National Comission of Human Rights, it promoted the human rights of transgender, transsexual and transvestite people. I read the comments, most of them were against the picture. Why would they discriminate just mentioning trans people? Everybody has rights. Why focusing just on them... on us...

I was angry. I wanted to comment and say my point of view. Argue against their rationalizations and fallacies. What would I gain? I would not convince anyone of them just as nobody could convince me. I would just be exposed. "Why do you care? You are one, right? It's your choice if you want to chop your dick off, I don't have to see you as a woman and treat your delusion"

I do project my thoughts into my expectations of others.

We walked outside the CECUT and entered its gardens. I took pictures and shared some on snapchat. My aunts have seen them. Do they know about my trans status? I have almost none of my father's siblings. Not Alex, nor Patty, nor Martha. I have cousins, like Tiana and Xennia and Charlie and I think even his brother. Does my aunt Alma knows? One of her sons saw and liked my post.

From my mother's side there are more people, all her siblings have added me, almost all of their sons. Even some of her own cousins and their offspring. Armida, Cande, my cousins from Anaheim.

I can see some who would maybe take it differently. Cruz and her family. My uncle Alex. They are both religious. Would I be rejected when there are children near?

What would happen next time I visit my old father's house?

Tomorrow I'll might buy some clothes. Tomorrow I won't dress like a boy. I won't wear a dress either, but I won't hide.

We saw the movie. I sat in the middle just like I had imagined. It was nice, entertaining. After it we ate. Both Luis and I ordered two bowls of Ramen, just like the last time we went to the movies together. Driving there one passenger of the car besides us talked to me. He said good afternoon and kept talking. I tried to ignore him but did not know if he was still addressing me.

I remember the idea of someone else doing or saying something, but I can't recall precisely what happened.

At least I know I was seen as a girl. At least by some people.

### 2016-08-06

I'm home. I've eaten already. I finished the burrito with everyone but Luis in the table. "Do you want some sauce, m'son?". It's like getting a gentle slap to the forehead. They might not be enough to really hurt me, but they caught my attention and interrupt my thoughts, I get stopped and confused. One is just a little inconvenience, several might make me go insane.

Just before going to the table I finished putting away the clothes I bought. I should start from the very beginning.

Yesterday night I told Catherine how it was really nice to see her tag me in the picture with Luis. Being exposed, showed. Later she mentioned how in fact it is too much to her. Her friend liked the picture and they were in their house with other several people. The topic about her going to the movies came up in the conversation. She was just waiting for her friend to say something, make a comment or ask a question.

She apologized and I replied with the truth. I won't push her to do it, nor I will get sick and give her an ultimatum. Nonetheless, it does hurt. It's painful the idea that our relationship is something to be ashamed of, or maybe even me.

6 in the morning I woke up and read her message, she apologized again. But this time it was twice, and a little more, uh, crude? Bare... No...

I stayed awake. I can't remember what was it that I did. I played game boy, or read something in the internet or whatever in the tablet and or phone. I did not went back to sleep completely. An hour or two later, I got up and shower. I did not shave. I wore the red leggings and the duck t-shirt. I wore make up. It wasn't the most feminine outfit but I did try.

Grandma come with us. An hour before noon we were leaving home. The line to cross the border was by the hospital. We made a little more than two hours.

My back is hurting again.

We finally crossed. The first place was the mail. Were there mentions of my name? Or his? Did they called or refer to me in any way before the meal?

In the mail the four packages were Miguel's. Luis stayed in the car with the women. I'm tired. I see the bed with anticipation.

We went to denny's. The waiter and waitresses welcomed us but as a big group there was no single mention to me. Not until I asked for silverware. "Of course, sir", she said. Was it my voice? My face? I started doubting myself since then.

Back in the mail I saw the pepper spray and actually considered buying it. It would be useful, at least as a mean of defense, just an insurance so I could not feel as vulnerable and weak.

"Have you thought were you want to go?" Asked me my mother after I returned from the bathroom and we got up from the table. I told her the options.

I went to the bathroom. I used the woman's, but again unsure and nervous. It was empty and I actually doubt what would happen had anyone been there. Would they ask me to leave or question me? Would I defend myself?

The first place we went to was Wal Mart. All of us were together at first. When they went ahead looking for Luis materials, I stay behind and went back to the ladies department. I browsed the clothes. I grabbed a couple of blouses and a pair of pants and looked for them. After reuniting, the three of us looked.

"Iva... Son", she called me out loud. I had told Catherine before how I would correct them, explain and tell them to not misgender me in public. But I did nothing. My grandma kept referring me as son and she and my mother went back to the masculine, how I was broad by the waist and things like that.

Before the cashier I went ahead and sat in a bench. My grandma sat in the one besides. She reclined and told me how my mother saw a lot of blouses that she liked. "She saw them and saw a lot and she liked them for you, and they would look really pretty in you" She smiled and showed me the excitement my mother might had showed. It was a warm nice feeling that soon died. 'I told her back, to take it easy, with calm. 'Relax, be patient, leave HIM look for them alone by now'.


Just know she used Ivan with hesitation and then continued saying 'Sofi and Luis'.

It was not that they still see me as a man. Is that even looking for blouses and pants and shorts and woman's clothes, they kept seeing me and calling me as him. She sees me as Ivan playing dress-up.

In Target, we separated since the beginning. I went to the clothes and saw them. I felt dysphoric and nervous, exposed and uneasy. I felt everyone's eyes on me. In Wal mart as we looked for a parking stop a car passed by and a young black man said out loud: "That was ugly!", while locking eyes with me. I repeated myself over and over, how it probably, most surely, it was something completely unrelated to me. Yet again, it hurt deeply, is if it were a confirmation of my inner conflict.

Everybody came to where I was and met me after I had returned from the dressing rooms. Why did I bother modulating my voice if I was unsure how I looked?

More clothes, more.

My mother and Luis came with me. I don't mind buying clothes with my mother anymore.

Lastly, we went to Las America. I bought shoes and socks. I paid by myself. The cashier welcomed me as "you guys". It was... weird.

I took pictures of the clothes and shared them with Catherine.

Now I have options and things to wear. I won't feel like a picture or a caricature. I hope.


### 2016-08-07

I'll see Catherine tomorrow. Yesterday I bought almost a new wardrobe. My mother helped me, she gave it to me. She paid for it.

Later I can ask her for the earrings.

It was the last conversation before falling asleep. Catherine told me how she saw a queer guy in the swap meet with her mother. He was applying make up to himself. He put on a long gown and hair extensions. He looked very pretty. She thought her mother would make a face or say a mean comment like a he-she or weird guy, but even her admired his abilities. It was a salon. She thought of me, maybe I could use its services, like, for the wedding. That was the way the subject came up. I was fragile from the sights and misgendering that happened the whole day. Thinking about calling and making an appointment with the hope of being gendered feminine on the phone, going with a clean face and still be seen as a girl, expecting the best without any idea of my preference or taste. It was unnerving.

I asked her if she could go with me. No. The day of the wedding would be impossible. She'd be busy, obviously. I felt hopeless and inept. I cried thinking about the whole day and how even with all these new clothes, I'd still be the same person looking the same, getting the same sights and calls of an old name.

Was it yesterday night or today when she apologized?

I told her, explained why it made me nervous. I have no experience nor knowledge. The time presses and asphyxiates me. She said she could imagine, she felt the same about our graduation. It was just a matter of calling and setting the appointment. I projected the rage I was feeling towards her. It's harder, I have it harder. I don't sound like a woman on the phone, nor I look like one before wearing make up, nor I am one, not really, universally.

"I see you as my equal, I'm sorry"

"But I am not"

She apologized again.

I found it extremely hard to get up from bed. I had several different dreams. I shared just a fraction of them with her. I told her about our rendezvous in this bedroom of a new house. I was taking clothes off, while we lied down on the floor and kissed. I wanted to convince her to make love. She didn't want to because of the time? Or did she have to be somewhere, maybe do something. People started entering the window, friends of Miguel. I covered and put on some clothes as I welcomed them. He kept telling the rest to use the fire escape, the window. Catherine left.

Two of them came to me and asked me how it was, how did people take it. "About what?", I was confused. "Miguel told us something about you, like you have a boyfriend or something like that?" I dismissed them a little embarrassed and upset with him for telling. Something happen with the kids. There was a girl from Spain, but I have forgotten most about it.

In other dreams I was jumping between scenes and places. I was in session with a therapist. I could appear to myself 5 years in the past and actually talk and say something. I convinced myself of talking to the therapist for something. Was me from the present going to the me from before everything appeared? Did I tell myself what would happen? Was I trying to make the transition easier or actually stop it altogether?

I don't remember.

My grandma told me to try the blouse on so she could do the fixes. I wore a bra and put it on inside out. She knocked on the door. "I actually betted you would open it without knocking" my mother told her. She put the pins in and I took it.

It was then that we had the conversation, I guess, me and Catherine. I cried again. I slept a little with the music from the tablet soothing my slumber. I was fallen in dreams when I hear the door and saw her. "Sofia", she called, as if she had practiced it. "Were you asleep (feminine)?" She corrected it in the last minute. I put it one for her to see it was fit. This time she didn't leave the room.

"Were you wearing a bra?, well it doesn't change much, does it?"

Later, in Luis room, my mother would come while he and my mother were there as well. I asked her for a ride tomorrow to the crossing border. They talked about yesterday, a woman they saw. "She was wearing this thing, it was dark red, burgundy, like wine. The sleeves were a little loose until here, and then they were open and falling. It came down to the legs and had flow. The sleeves covered it as it danced in the movement. I could make you something like that. You might like it".

She saw it and told my mom she could do something similar. "I don't like dresses, mum". "Do you think maybe they might like it?" and pointed at me.



### 2016-08-08

I got up and got ready. Everything was set. I postponed the alarmed and then disarmed it before it could start. Catherine was already in school. I was going to be leaving home by noon. We would meet crossing the border. She asked me if I could leave home an hour earlier. She thought she might go for the pass in her free hour. Someone was in the bathroom. I didn't think I could make it. It was my grandmother. Did she know? My mother said she might want to accompany us. Ans she did. The three of us left a couple of minutes after eleven. I wore the pants that look like jeans and the Mickey Tshirt. I told my mother I would exchange a fifteen hundred. She gave me two hundred dollars in return. In the way there, my mom told me how she was talking with my godmother. She said that it was good that she now has someone to tell her what she can and can't wear. And the four of us can go shopping now.

It feels weird hearing those kind of comments. I longed for a long time being included in a feminine plural. "Las cuatro". Why does it feel condescending, now? My mom is struggling, she wants to. She tells Luis to ask Sofia what to eat, and then when I give my answer, she tells my grandma Ivan said it.

Should I put a new counter of the days since Monica crosses my mind? Just seeing it would be reason enough to restart it. That's a stupid idea. Counting the days of indifference is ironic. Were I really apathetic I would not care about that number.

They left me and I walked. I had not to stop until I reached the booth. The CBP officer asked me "Where are you going?" even before I handed him my ids. I answered, "San Ysidro" with a normal voice. "What will you do?", "shopping". "What do you bring with you?" "Nothing, just me". He clicked in the profile that appeared on his screen. Looked at the card and then said as he looked at me: "Jos..." and stopped suddenly. His eyes were locked with mine and opened at the same time his voice went silent. He just handed them to me and told me to go. I walked and exited on the other side.

I waited for half an hour, maybe a little less. I was sitting in a bench when I noticed the girl in blue looking at me. She recognized me and smiled. I stood up and went to meet her. "It's been a lot since I've seen you", we kissed on out cheeks and asked how we've been. "Are you waiting for someone?", and she left. Jacqueline. She met me when I had four or five years. We shared the classroom with Jessica, she's one of her closest friends in jr high. Did she see me as a woman? Did she see that same boy but grown?

Why did I imagined her telling to her mate "You see that person I just said hi to? He is a man, I met him when he went by Ivan"

I walked to the old pedestrian crossing and met Catherine in the trolley station. I paid for my daily pass. We went to the adult school and she bought hers. We ate in chipotle. I wanted to go to in n out. I felt like it. She didn't tell me not to go, she offered to go to both places. I declined.

We went to Target, after there we could go to Ross and then Las Americas. That was the plan. We gave a round through the ladies' section. I tried on two blouses of different sizes but took none. I bought a pair of black oxfords. I didn't need them. I needed shoes for the wedding. I need the dress for both it and the graduation.

I was browsing the underwear after we talked about how most of mine was somewhen hers.

"Sofi, I have to go", she tried putting on the audio but I heard nothing. The aunt of his father had died. Of course we should return. I paid for the shoes and went to the trolley.

Crossing back to Mexico, the frustration hit me. It's a month until the wedding and again I have nothing. I spent 40 dollars and haven't gotten anything ready. The day is getting closer and I don't know what I will do or wear.

It wasn't just that. I was upset but had no right to those feelings. Her fucking grand aunt just died, what did I expect? For her to stay and accompany me?

I was angry at myself every time I confronted my own emotions.

Even now, I don't know where all this anger comes from and to whom it's directed.

### 2016-08-09

Tomorrow I'm supposed to see Rene for my session. What has happened this week?

I know I've had several different dreams. Most of them present the theme of me being recognized as a woman. Either by Paola asking for Ivan to be the team leader and the professor agreeing picking the boy next to me, "and this girl", pointing at me. In others, like the one from this morning, I was in this new house. They were some animals, a cat and a dog. Exploring the rooms in it, I stepped into the bathroom to see this weird machine full of complicated adjustments and apparatus. I came to the realization that it was for me. I would need help, I wouldn't be able to get up. I would be sick.

Yesterday was I angry? I was upset... disappointed. My mother asked me to see what I bought. I showed her the shoes and she seemed a little let down. "They're like, for wearing with jeans, right?" Today she asked me, when we were alone in the living room: "What kind of clothes do you like?" For what? generally or for a certain occasion? Why? She just asked again as if it were an obvious question. Then she explained. When I bought clothes, the were mostly discreet colors, t-shirts. She would imagine I'd get, I don't know, dresses, or skirts.

Maybe she was projecting her expectations of me being a transgender woman. She might have thought I'd be desperate to wearing the most feminine clothes I could find.

But I just chose the things which I know, the colors I am used to. I have to be exploring slowly what kind of clothes I like and what kinds look good on me.

Was it yesterday or today when they again started talking about this saturday? Chevo has gotten his house ready. He said "girls, let's start giving suggestions for the movies you want to see". Does he sees the rest of us as girls, now? Am I part of that specification?

Is it a natural progression or have they talked about it? Maybe I do look different.

Yesterday my mother talked to me and asked me about the hormones. She shared a little of what she's learned in the youtube videos. I have changed, she came to the conclusion herself after asking myself for my experience. The saturday I wore leggings, my legs looked bigger. "you were not that leggy [masculine]" My butt has grown, as well. Catherine would later confirm it, too, when I told her this evening. She saw me yesterday.

Today it's the funeral, the wakening?. I don't know the word. Tomorrow will be the mass in the morning.

I brought the subject again, would see us tomorrow or would she prefer thursday or friday? I had to know the plans she would have.

The phone just rang. I stepped up from my chair and looked at the number. I have decided not to answer. I am not comfortable. Edgar is the one calling. What name should I answer with? "Hi, who's this?" "Edgar, hey, shortie... how's it been?"

No. I am not ready. I am nervous. Even talking with them on the phone makes me anxious. I asked what we would do in the weekend. My father having the call-on phone was a relief. My mother wanted to go. She even bought a swim suit. She did not push to me the idea of picking one. I don't know how would I had reacted.

"Hello, who's this... Laura?" "No, it's Sofia"...

I wouldn't had.

Luis answered the phone earlier today. It was a courier saying he had a package for Jose Luis. Anyone could pick it up. I grabbed my keys and wallet. They might want an id and signature.

I opened the door before I could get the meaning of his "you don't need to sign". He handed me the envelope and just asked for my name. Which one could I give him? How was I seen? Why did I make no mention of that worry to my mom?

I don't feel comfortable wearing extremely feminine clothes because I worry about the way people see me. I feel at ease wearing androgynous ones, it's safer this ambiguos zone. I hate wearing a dress and being called "sir" or "he".

He just annotated Ivan Fernandez and left.

I asked Catherine if I'd need to go dressed as a boy to the funeral or church. She told me she did not know.

Her family, that part of the family doesn't know about me. On the other hand she has not talked with her parents. Depends of the answer I get from Rene I might go to the church or she invited me to come home.

"I'm sorry, I'd prefer going until after you've talked with them"

The idea, thought of her saying she's going with Ivan, talking about his family, his invitations, makes me sick.

Today, my grandmother did not say Ivan once. It was always Sofi.

Why was it not enough? What more do I want?

### 2016-08-10

How long has it been since the last time I was at Catherine's home?

Just one week before the last session. Maybe next week I'll attend after going to the laboratory to get my blood drawn and my levels checked. This week it was before Catherine's grand uncle burial.

"Would your brother be jealous? Do you think he would like me?"

I got up from a peculiar dream. I can't remember even its theme. The alarm woke me up before 9. Today's meeting would be two hours before my usual time. I showered and dressed. Catherine asked me yesterday if I'd accompany her. I discarded the idea of wearing gray and red. I put on the burgundy pants and a gray tank top under the gray-striped white shirt. I put make up. Catherine and I would be leaving our homes almost at the same time. The mass would be around 10:30. I showed her a picture of my outfit before I hesitated and decided to change. I put on a green blouse and tried a gray thin cardigan. I went back to the original.

I looked androgynous. It was a male shirt. The pants were skinny and tapered to my legs. The neck of the tank was low enough for the curves of my young breasts to be noticeable. Leaving the shirt opened the feminine attributes were more obvious, closing it, I found almost no difference to the me from months ago.

I walked to Rene with time to spare. The needle was threatening to hug the E signaling an empty tank. I parked the car and spent the 5 pesos coin that survived in the pocket of my purse for who knows how long.

I don't think I talked about anything important with Rene. I am thinking again about leaving him. This time I don't consider it a good idea to mention it to Catherine. I should tell him, though. Why don't I want to go? Do I feel I'm not working anything? The graduation and the wedding are close. I haven't seen my family. I have no job nor patients.

I haven't started the slides for the course nor the project proposal for the investigation. I haven't even started to research for my themes of interests nor for the requisites for the master program.

Next week I'll see the endocrinologist. Will I dare to mention my want to change medication? What is it that scares me so much about speaking up?

From Rene I drove to the graveyard. I had never gone to one here in Tijuana. Catherine was waiting me inside close to the tent were her family was gathered. Nobody gendered me today. Yeah, some did, just not the way I desired.

"Has Sofia left yet?"

Her mother welcomed and greeted me. "Son". "Ivan".

I was not introduced to anyone else of her family. I stood next to her and held her hand. I saw the crude emotions of the people who were mourning. Some spoke. One, the first woman who did, talked more about god than the woman herself. It was all about her strength who was because of her faith and fear for god and devotion to him.

"What would you like for when you die?"

I don't want a bishop or a priest near my casket. I don't want no mention of god in my death. All of you can pray for me, but do it in your own houses. God was never in my life, please don't bring him to my death.

I feel resentment. But how fair is it?

I'm not mad at God. Not really. Would he really exist, what has he done to me to be so mad about? Give me the wrong body, an incorrect childhood? No. I hate his followers. They deny me. The pope talks against me. I don't want no mention of heaven or eternal glory. I want them to remember my life, our memories.

I looked at the tombs spread in the ground and all of those names. I said nothing, but I feared about my own. What name would they put on there?

Maybe ashes is a better option for me. I spent almost my whole life in discord with my own body. Both men and woman's ashes are the same.

We visited the tomb of his brother and then went home. Her dog didn't recognized me at first. She's getting blind, but ran to me and sniffed me. Did her cousin recognized me?

Everyone told him my name wrong. Will he grow and get used to that wrong name as almost all of Catherine's family?

### 2016-08-11

"Good afternoon, brave! How's your life in this your renew life? I hope your surroundings are more supportive and tolerant than what I've seen in Spain on occasions"

I woke up to the friend request of Arantxa on my profile. She sent me some messages and we chatted for a while.

I slept and rested nested and knotted inside the sheet. It was hard getting back up. I hadn't thought about it like this, but I have the motivation every morning of rising and start the day with another dose of hormones. New changes, a new stick in the counting of this new life. For months I saw the transition as a distant future. It's been months since that day come. Half a year I've been 23, half a year since I dared to make the call and set the appointment. Three months passed until I got in. Another three months since then. More than a hundred days changing.

In the evening I was talking with Catherine after her return from classes.

"Cari, your mom knows I won't attend the wedding in a suit, doesn't she?"
"Uh, she didn't, but I guess she does now"

She had passed her the phone to show her a picture. It vibrated in her hands. The message appeared on the upper side of the screen. She must had looked at it. I asked her if she said something. She did not. Is it active denial? I'm her daughter's partner.

Later I asked her if she would say something. She told me she would, but it doesn't comfort me any more. Is it that I don't believe her? She has to. She can't not do it. What is it that I fear? At first it was about just being with my family, standing besides them, facing them and seeing their reactions. I've done it. I've seen them face to face and confronted their reactions, or would if there had been any.

Now it's her parents. They've seen me, too. The greeted me and welcomed me to their home. I showed androgynously yet I looked feminine. They called me Ivan, still, they used male pronouns. It hurts, it's painful. Do I have a right to ask her?

Is this something I will have to deal with constantly?

What will it be when the day comes, and they have to welcome my family at the reception. How will I introduce myself to their family? Will they greet me as Ivan? Even with make up and a night gown will they see me as her boyfriend? Will the other people who've already met him recognize his profile in my face?

Next week I'll catch up to her in the other side of the border again. I have to look for a dress and shoes. I might look for a handbag. Other stuff to look for are underwear and a belt.

I'm nervous about the make up and the hair and the clothes and her family and my own. The wedding is scary.

This weekend I'll see the gang. Catherine will come pick me up and she will give them the invitations. After it we'll drive to Playas and pick up a pizza. I'll bring the bottle of spanish sidra. We'll meet then in Chevo's house. Do his parents worry me as well? What if they say something? Will they recognize me? It's more about his mother than his father. Do they know? Has he told them? Maybe he already mentioned my situation and uses my name.

I congratulated Felipe for his birthday. I sent him the message in the morning after talking with Arantxa. Just moments ago he responded it. "Thank you very much, Sofia. It's time for a meeting with the mate (Manuel) or what?" He tagged him so he came and commented as well.

Will the meeting really take place? Why did I get nervous? Two weeks have passed since Aidee proposed to help me with make up. I haven't answer. We met outside the bars the time I went out with the girls. "Chat me to set up the meeting". I didn't. Will I?

I could use her. It would be really helpful. It's something I need. Why do I avoid her?

Does seeing Manuel and Felipe scare me? Is it their reactions or their questions? They both accepted me and sent me a friend request. He used my name. There should be no reason to worry.

Catherine asked me if I had commented to my mom about the course we saw in Mexicali. I didn't. Seeing Edgar scares me as well. Facing him.

Maybe I wasn't as ready as I thought.

No. It had to be done. I would had never been ready enough.

### 2016-08-12

"Write about me today"

How long have we known each other? Recently there were some Facebook posts where people shared a little video about their friendship. "Today's the 5th anniversary of them being friends", or something like that. Do we have that time?

She was the one who talked to me first. She approached me in the classroom and started the conversation. "We were in the same highschool, I've seen you before". Later she would confess to me how I came sort of dismissive and kind of an asshole. I remember the day, and remember seeing her, but I can't recall what I thought or felt. Would I ever imagine the conversations we would later have? Could I even imagine that we'd share nights and beds and clothes and even our bodies?

"What about you?" I asked her. She didn't know. Just talk about her, describe her, narrate times where she was adorable or that make me laugh.

She remembered when I brought both of us to the floor after getting my foot stuck in the loop of her backpack. People saw us and came to help. I scrape my knee. We both laughed almost all the way to her car from the japanese restaurant of pizza. Adorable moments are when I give her little kisses in her cheeks or her head.

What do I think about?

I go to bittersweet moments. I guess it's in my nature to find home in sadness. But they're not tragic.

We were in first semester, the workshop of Fidel. In one I silently represented a dream where I feel everyone looking down on me. They answered me back with movements as well. She reassured me.

It was a different one, where she cried. Had I known about her accident? Was it something related to her brother? I just remember understanding. Again, without a word I went to her and I hugged her. There was no need to say anything.

I could count the classes we did not share with my fingers the whole 9 semesters we studied. We would almost always seat close. Whenever I would be in front, her fingers would find a way to my hair. They'd hide in there, exploring the different paths hidden in my curls.

We ran twice. It was the first time we went out together. Was it? Didn't we to go Ensenada before that, to the conference that Juan Carlos invited us to? It was our first travel, the first outer city we would explore. The race was in fourth semester. We ended up all colored. I would meet her father that day. It was the first time he saw me as Ivan. Then I was just her friend.

In fourth semester I think I had a girlfriend still. Even then we would use our free time to be together. That was the semester we spent without Anahi. Whenever a class would be cancelled, or other times were we would skip it, we would go to Playas. I remember those times and relate them with coldness and warmth. We both wore coats, hats and beanies. My hair was getting longish. Did we start talking about my secret yet? We would go to Argana and smoke and talk. We did not kiss until the next semester, before we left the country.

I didn't have a girlfriend anymore, but I got another best friend. We started sharing nights without being really with each other. We talked and talked and when we ran out of stuff to say, we shared our inner shadows. With her, I lost my fear to my darkness.

I had a mixture of confusing feelings. My inner self was a battleship of ideas and conflicting emotions. She got caught in the fire.

We kissed in that cafe I once joked would be the central perk of our group of Friends. Even now we still go to that same cafe. We still kiss. But our kisses are no longer experimental or careful. They're not controlled or surprising. They're messy, they're warm, they're passionate and confident. They're playful and calm.

We both have changed. I am not the same person she met.

She has grown in my eyes. I look at her and see beauty. I love her caring eyes and the roundness of her cheeks when she smiles at me.

We would go late at night after class and sat in the reclined seats of her car. The windows frosted. There was coldness in those times. We talked and talked and the words would cover us and entertain us. Our hands would meet between us. Her fingers would end up being entwined between mine. Even in the coldness of the nights I always found warmth with her.

### 2016-08-13

The clothes are all set and put in big bags. Several of the jeans my mom is discarding are 14 in size. I thought about Catherine's size. Would they fit? I decided not to say anything, if they did, maybe she would take them.

I set the alarm thinking we would go to the restaurant to have breakfast. I woke up and heard my dad leaving and coming back. The rustling of the paper back convinced me that we would not really go. Everyone was in bed or asleep. I ate and took my pills.

I returned to bed and fell asleep for an hour. I was tired and exhausted. It was past midnight when I was trying to sleep. The lights outside of my bedroom where lit and plastic sounds squeaked rhythmically. Maybe they came from my mother, maybe it was Miguel or my grandma.

I showered a little after noon. Today is the day that they're going to cut the water. Catherine will come pick me up. She'll leave her home at 5 in the afternoon. It's two and a half hours from now.

When I put my underwear and the towel in the bathroom I noticed that Luis' door was locked. What was he doing? The first thought that cross my mind was when I used to lock mine last year as I tried on the clothes I bought or borrowed. I didn't want to risk someone opening the door and seeing me.

Did not one of them notice ever?

Luis did. Luis touched my back and his finger landed just on the closure of the bra. "Are... are you wearing a bra?" He was confused and startled, his words came as if he didn't even believe he was asking that.

I denied it and crouched on my chair.

i tried to open the door and he said he was changing. I brushed my teeth and showered. In there I untangled and washed my hair again, shaved both my armpits and chest, soaped my whole body and shave my legs. After exiting and drying my body I shaved my face.

Yesterday my mother shared: "Your godmother said: 'just tell Sofia to pluck her eyebrows and not let them grow like yours". My grandmother said nowadays girls leave them thick. Then said I don't need to. My mother continued saying I would say I already do. "Do you?"

I have and haven't. I take the stranded hairs that I see but I don't dare to change their form. They're thick and manly. They're natural. They're fine by now.

I didn't bother to put on the gray jeggings and black blouse. I put the hose shorts I did and over them the jeans-like pants. On top I wore the black casual blouse my grandmother looked for me just like my mother's. This is what I am going to wear to Chevo's house. It's neutral. Neutral-like. A little androgynous. Would their parents see me as Ivan or as me? Do they know? Will they see me?

I am a little nervous. Catherine will give my parents the invitations to the wedding today. She'll be arriving in three hours.

When I came down and put my clothes and face, I hesitated before opening the door. Will I always have this uncertain feeling? Like grabbing air and courage before going into the dark cave and face my demons, except I'm not going in, I'm getting out.

Everybody here knows and have seen me already. What do I fear?

In the table was Luis and my mother, both wearing headphones and busy in their tablets. I asked Luis if he showered. When I got out of the shower his door was still locked. It was way too much to be changing. He said he did before me. He narrated all of his actions from waking up to being in the table talking to me.

"Because we did not get up in the morning we didn't go to eat breakfast, but we will go to dinner."

Is that why my mom was blowdrying her hair just now? I won't change outfit will I? I'll stay like this. Do I look feminine? Do I look casual? Will I be out of place in there?

What if time goes short and we don't get to come in before Catherine's? What if this is the waiter that gets to be the first one to say something offensive? What if I get called femininely before my father corrects them? What if I get called masculinely and it hurts?

Will it be my fault for not going fully feminine? Is this going to be always a necessity to be seen?

Do my clothes define me now?



### 2016-08-14

It is a tiring day. I'm exhausted. Again I was the second person to get up from bed. I might had been the first one to wake.

Yesterday we did leave. At first I had come to the conclusion that I would have to stay here alone waiting for Catherine. I had gone upstairs to see how my mother was doing. It was three in the afternoon. She said how my grandmother was not hungry so we might go to the movies first. I couldn't. Catherine would pick me up, I had mentioned it.

Even if we weren't going to the movies I couldn't make it back on time.

We did leave. We went to the restaurant my mother had said. Los Jarrones. It was a mexican place. They offered us buffet or the carte. We could stand up and take a look before deciding. I took their offer and went with my mother and grandma. I was the first to return and the table was almost empty. Just my dad was sitting.

"So, is it going to be carte, lady?", said the waitress before I took it.

We ate.

I had the jeans and the t-shirt and was seen as a woman, I think.

Catherine came for me an hour after we got home. I went for her and accompanied her home. She greeted my family and gave them the invitations. The bags of my mother's clothes were in the living room. She explained how they counted 5 of us but if my grandma decided to stay for those times I could just tell her and they'll give her another reception.

"Yeah, Sofi can just tell me", she would later tell me how it felt uncomfortable when they looked at her after saying my name. My father took his eyes from the table and pointed them at hers. My mum and grandma looked at her disbelieved. It would make me feel worse now that we touched the subject just moments ago.

She drove us to Chevo's. We make a stop first in the pizza place. She waited by the car and I ordered the pizza. I gave them my name. They didn't deny it nor made any face or comment. They wrote it down. The one who took my money was going to gender me but stopped. Did I feel their discomfort or was I just projecting mine?

The owner of the place was managing the orders and receipts. He took my pizza and called my name. They looked directly at me as I was sitting in front of them. They just handed it. Would they talk about me after my leaving? Did they notice? Do I have something to notice and talk about?

With Chevo we were the first ones to arrive. Paola was the second and last one. We ate dinner and drank wine as adults. We chatted and laughed. We bought snacks and watched a movie. It was the first gathering Chevo organized and hosted in his home. He felt proud. We should feel proud for being the firsts. He used the plural feminine several times, lots more than before.

Even when we said our good-byes, I think I heard the sound of his kiss as he hugged me. "How did you feel?" asked Catherine as I told her. It was weird, new, uncomfortable. Men don't kiss good-bye. I am not a man. I am a woman. It should be normal.

I hesitated before greeting his dad for that same reason. Did he recognize me? Would he give me his hand or his cheek? Would I want to know?

Today was a slow and tiring day. I feel the pressure of the absence of things to do. I feel useless and inept. A lifeless bag of bones and meat. No function nor desires.

I told my parents about the course in Mexicali. Catherine told theirs. At first it was an euphoric excitement. We could spend the nights together again. Then it hit me. She told them she could stay with me, except she didn't talk about me. She used Ivan. Because they know Ivan.

I asked her and she confirmed it. Today my father said it, too. Twice. He has never used the name and I don't think I'll hear him soon. My mother, to him, used Ivan as well. Was it on purpose? Was it a slip just like my grandma's?

It didn't use to bother me this much.

She felt bad when I asked. And I said I feel bad every time I hear it.

"I feel like pressure"

"I feel like my name doesn't matter, as if it's just a whim or a game. That it's a nickname and Ivan is my "real name". I feel pain and misunderstood and loneliness. I just want to go where I won't have to ask, where no one knows me as Ivan. Where it'll stop being my other name and it will just be who I am."

She saw them but said nothing. She might be asleep just now.

### 2016-08-15

The night is heavy and warmth. It's been a long and hot day. Today's biggest moments were unexpected.

Yesterday night was hard. I forgot to restart the counter of the days since I cried. We were talking about the course in Mexicali. Today after my mother came, in the table I told them about Catherine's plan to go, too. My grandmother said we could all stay home. Later, my mom asked me: "More than how will you sign up, how will you sign up as? Ivan or Sofia?" It was a gut-punching reminder of yesterday's conversation.

It all started because of that. I asked her for her plans of calling to the lab in Mexicali. She replied saying I have to call, as well. She doesn't know if they'll let her sing both of us in. "And I don't know which name you'll use"

I didn't either. "Ivan, I guess", and my stomach turned upside down and fell how it fell to my feet. She apologized. I confessed that I didn't know anymore if I wanted to go. I thought about it, how will my voice sound? Will I sign as Sofia with a female voice? If it is not convincing enough? What will happen if they ask for an id or a certification? Or if I give my legal name, what will happen when I go and ask for my badge or seat or whatever... Will I dress as a boy? As a girl?

I hate being in this limbo.

I remembered hearing my mom changing name and pronouns near my father. It was a twist to the dagger in my chest. "When you told your parents, did you say you could stay with Ivan's grandma?"

"Yes" I shared the memory of my mother's turn around. She said she barely had time with her parents. My question made her feel bad, guilty. I feel bad every time I hear that name. She felt pressure. And I told her...

I remember how this were yesterday last words. She did answer after that.

She knows how I feel, that is painful. She doesn't like having to say stuff, hers, mine, whoever's. I wished I had never been their son and never had been her boyfriend.

"We've talked about this before, there is nothing else to do. I feel bad, that it was wrong, introducing you as Ivan. I want to be calm with those choices, we both took them, you agreed. You make me feel so guilty, regretful, just bad..."

"I was your boyfriend, that doesn't matter anymore. I just want to stop being him. You said you would break up with him and today you talked about going to his house."

"I can't do it as fast as you wish"

"It's been almost half a year", that was a low punch.

She exploded and I fell to a dark pit of hopelessness and misery. We went to sleep.

The morning I was still in the hole. I had no energy nor will to get up.

I took my breakfast and pills and return. I lied down and listened to music. Then a song started interrupting the ipad. For a long time I related the game of thrones ring tone to an intro call. This time the melody was different. It brought me back to that arabic cafe where we lie in pillows and smoke shisha. It wasn't a memory, it was a call. It was Liliana. She wanted to ask me two things. I forgot the first one... and the second one as well, now.

She wanted to reunite us to a work meeting, and see how I appear on Facebook so she can add me to a group chat.

Yesterday it was all about the frustration of being stuck with this name and persona. I can't apply to jobs or courses. I can't do shit without showing this incongruence. It's tiring and irritating and I'm so sick of this.

And now here it was, more job, things to do, meetings.

The day after tomorrow, I'll go to the lab again in the morning. From then, depends of what Rene says I might go to therapy or skip it until next week and go to the meeting.

Thursday I'll get to her crossing the border just like last week. Except this time I'll let the car in a parking lot. I hope. We might look for dresses or clothes. I still have to find what I'm going to wear.

Aidee talked to me today. She started the conversation and I apologized for not reaching out to her. We established the day of our meeting and talked about stuff, how has her life been, and how has mine.

I'll see her by the end of this month, the next day of the saturday I'll meet with the gang by Catherine's.

### 2016-08-16

She talked about all the pressures she has. It all started because of a proposal. If we return early from the United States, can we go to Argana?

"Argana and that other stuff, later". I understand, of course, that's all she needed to say. I apologized about the plans. It was just an offer. I have been mentioning. Do I feel like talking? I want to relax, I need to relax... I have been a little intense, I guess...

She continued listing all the things she has to do, she feels pressure and swallowed in time. Going to Mexicali is going to cost her another week here. I asked her if she's so filled why did she mention the course? We should not see each other until we leave for Mexicali. I went to the bathroom to take a shower. I left the phone on purpose so I would not see immediately after her reply.

Just moments ago I was sitting in my bed with the tank wet and my hair dripping. I used the old red one that I was wearing to take the excessive water from the bun of curls that was tied in the back of my neck. He walked step by step towards my room, as if his shadow were securing the perimeter first. He stood by the doorframe and asked if I had gone out today.

Did I? No. I didn't. Will I go out tomorrow? Yeah, and the day after, too.

"Will you be here by the afternoon so we take your mother to dinner?"

Sure. My Thursday just got free.

"Are you mad?", was the first message I read from her. Was I? Am I now? I felt something, I still do.

The last one she sent said "I got upset. I don't want to say anything to you now"

She's been typing since I came to this chair and started these words. I, on my end, am trying to decipher how and what am I feeling.

...I am a little upset. Your messages and everything lately makes me feel like my pressures don't matter ...

She answered and I went there. My head hurts still. Today, I won't be... no, I can't eat anymore. I have to fast until tomorrow morning. Maybe it's that, maybe is the crying.

"I think about the wedding and I feel impotence. I feel I have no right to be upset or angry about your parents and family because it hurts you and you've apologized already and I know you're pressured. At the same time, though, I think how you don't feel the pain I do.
I can't be mad at you, so I don't know at who direct my anger or even what to feel"

Today I had several dreams. I narrated them to her.

In the first one I knew we were being hunted and looked for. I was in this house or the one in Otay... no, it was this one. My father was in the living room. I had all my things ready and we had to leave now. I now see the image of the Predator monster of that movie, an alien whose whole intention is hunt and kill. We were prey and I could feel it in every pore of my skin. I wanted to get away from here. There was no presence or mention of either Luis nor my mother. My father knew about our circumstances, but he acted is if it were nothing. I urged him, begged him to move, and he just called Miguel. I returned to my bedroom to get everything in order. Time passed, seconds that feel like minutes. I came back, crying, and my father called my brother screaming. There was no answer.

The dream changed. This time I was with my mother and we were waiting for my dad. He was in a convenience store upstair. The menace was the same, something of the like. "We have to go, if he hasn't returned, there must be a reason." My mother wanted to wait, but time passed and the danger was closer. "I'll look for him" and get out of the van. I walked the stairs cautiously. There were shatters of glass on the floor and a silent darkness that forewarn tragedy. Crouching, I came close to the door until a quiet beeping preceded the gunshots that passed over my head. There was no point in checking inside the store. I returned to the car and asked my mother to go.

There was a change in dream where Catherine was with me. We were still in the car and there was a chase. The danger was different, it was no longer supernatural or a monstrosity, it was more tangible and real. I had came to contact with it, maybe because of that.

For a reason we ended up in prison. We were captured by the police, not our hunters. Were they hunting her as well or just me? My mother was no longer with us, I think. We were there, in cells, literally trapped now. Waiting for they to catch us. I think somebody else came, one with a pistol. I saw the guard and ran towards him. I no longer feared the threat of being shot. My destiny had they caught me would have been worse. I took the gun from him and with it made an exit path for both Catherine and me. The man had company now, or maybe were the guards that wanted to get to us, as well. They pointed at us and shot. I tried to shoot, too, but nothing came from the gun. It was empty, useless. I was defenseless. We got into a car chase, a bizarre and surreal car chase.

The dream changed to a more realist one. We got out from certain kind of station. It was a new place, a new city. With us there were no luggage but the feeling of momentary relief and safety. I had still the gun in my bag. There were big and ancient looking buildings surrounding us. We walked and saw a certain kind of show, there were people dancing. It was an arabic dance, and in the multitude, lots of familiar faces appeared. I saw them and wondered if they could see me, too. Could they recognize me? Was I in danger?

I saw the outfit most of the girls were wearing and for the first time in the night I fell the familiar dread of dysphoria. I came conscious of the clothes that enveloped my body and the discordance of my projected identity.

We agreed to separate for a while. I should look for bullets and meet with someone who could give us new identities. I would meet her in the plaza some time later. And walking out of the scene I was the actor who, exiting the stage disassociates from the character he plays and returns to reality. I was still in a dream, but where the hell could I do somethings? Where could I go, whom could I meet?

I wandered to lose time and looked at the woman singing opera and the marching band of people dressed in purple. Time passed and I returned to Catherine. She stood in front of a statue. Her arms gliding in the air and his body dancing slowly to the tune of the singing. Her eyes were closed. She was wearing a different dress, it was blue. She looked beautiful and elegant in her musical trance. I came to her and told her everything was done.

The marching band surrounded us and passed us by. Inside them, we smiled.

"Do we have a class now?" "Yeah, in a couple of minutes", she answered as if it was a rational question. "We should go now, then" I said before I extended my hand and we left, who knows where to do who knows what.

### 2016-08-17

Tomorrow I won't be going to the United States after all. I asked Catherine, if she wanted to go just a couple of hours before we return early, but she said it was better to go another day.

I'm wearing the red jeans I bought in Target and the white and black blouse of Wal-mart. I was seen as a girl in the lab. This time the receptionist was a man. He was just cordially nice enough. He received my payment and confirmed my fast and asked about the way I'd like my results. Finally he assured, utilizing the feminine pronoun, that I'd be called.

I showered after my dad and Miguel left home. My mother asked me, where would I be going so early. I reminded her. I was already in the car when I realized I didn't have the remote to open the gate. I returned to the house and opened the mitsubishi to get my mother's remote and open the door. After leaving the keys in the table, I exited.

I got to the lab in a couple of minutes and was called to get my blood drawn. I felt clumsy knocking my bag to the wall after hanging it and then pushing the chair as I sat. The phlebotomist asked for my medication and made notes of them. After saying the names of the pills she looked up as if remembering what are they. I used the marketing names instead of the generic.

She took my blood and wished me a good day. The man who welcomed me ran to get the door for me. I walked towards the supermarket looking for a chocolate milk box and a packet of cookies. I found neither of them. I ended up buying a bottle of coffee flavored milk.

I drove home and my grandmother received me. I waited until it was time to therapy.

In there I did not know where to start.

My mother talked to me again, she asked me what happened with the psychologist that supervises, what was the conclusion to my asking what is going to happen with my patients. With my grandma then they confirmed how I do have changes. "I told her, 'call her, call her'... she looks beautiful".

With Rene I talked about Catherine's conversations this week. I even forgot to talk about Saturday's dinner at Chevo's. The end of the session was with the interpretation of my dreams. He added new things. "What was the alien? Who was the monster?" He asked me twice.

"Sofia!", you ran from it, and it took, killed your dad. You ended up in prison, because of it.

It didn't fit completely, until I fixed it. The threat changed across the dreams it turned more and more real. At first it was a monster and abstract, it was the chaotic future I expected, the "sickness" I feared. It turned more and more real until it became people, society.

When the purple march overcame us, Rene said it could be the pride parade.

From there I drove to Lili's. Catherine was already there. A minutes before the start of the meeting came Gilda. She knows me, she does have me in Facebook. She said hi like any other person would. There would be a fourth, a different one than the one who had seen me before.

She met me and said nothing. Lili never messed up and kept referring to all of us as women.

I came home. Then my mother did. I was in bed watching a video when, now I know, my grandmother asked her to call me so she could see me. She came and sat here, we talked a little about tomorrow's dinner.

It was later, when she called me again: "What do you propose?" I went and stood in the bar of the kitchen. "About what?" "We have to let Ivan go". She started crying silently and covering her face.

I sat besides her and the talk start.

She told me how she feels trapped between all of us, she wants to take care of the whole family. She sees me now, smiling and happy. And she sees too how after my dad calls me Ivan, the life out of my face fades away. She sees how whenever she calls me Sofia, the face of my dad changes as well.

We talked about that, how they still see Ivan in the couch, wearing his shorts and tank and his hair in a bun. She loved him, she will miss him.

The talk was long, and the thought of remembering it again bring tires me.

She asked me several times what could we do, how could we make this easier. Was therapy an option? The question scared me. How would it be to go all of us to therapy. I imagined what would I do. I don't do therapy, it's not my expertise and yet I had several ideas. I planned this whole dynamic.

Five chairs, Two for the brothers, two for the parents and one for the grandma. Then another two. In the first one, I would sit. This is Ivan. Then, the therapist would add another chair. But she is in the wrong seat. She belongs her, as the sister. This is Sofia. For 23 years she sat here, in his place, but finally she is were she belongs.

The chair would be empty. Everyone of us, would have a turn to say whatever they want to the empty seat. My mother would say how she loved me, and was proud of me, and she will always remember and cherish the time we spent together. My father maybe would open up and asked me not to go. He would say he wanted the very best for me. He'll miss me. My brothers maybe would say how they admired me and looked up to my achievements. They'll never forget what they learned from me. Finally it would be my turn. I would talk to the empty chair and tell him, that I was in his place, he was sad and he didn't enjoy life. He always thought about his family and wanted to be the very best to them. I could no longer fill his shoes. I would be me, and I know I'm taking his place, but I love him, anyway. I know he did what he could do, and it was the best. I'll never deny him.

Then, everyone would a have a turn to say something to me, in this chair, now my place. They could say how they accept me and love me. They could say lots of things that I don't want to pretend to know. Finally, in an act of closure, they would take the chair away. His chair is gone. We are the family that we are now.

How does everyone feel after Ivan's departure?

Should I take the chair before they talk to me in my new seat? Should I seat in Ivan's place to hear what they have to say to him, or hear it from my new seat? What is more powerful, to see me change seats or to talk to an empty one?

Why do I worry about it, if this is something I wouldn't bear to actually do?

### 2016-08-18

I'm home. This is my family. I congratulated my mom for her birthday. I sent her a simple message and a picture on her Facebook. We went to dinner. I wore the blue dress that Catherine so much likes.

I know I dreamt something. I told Catherine it was weird. I remember living through it and thinking how it was an amazing story. It is coming back to me. Maybe I write a little about it after remembering this day.

In the morning I made myself breakfast to take the pills. I ran out of spiro. Yesterday the results showed how my T levels are even lower than two months ago. They are just in the middle of the female range. I have no idea how the estrogen is affecting me or what the levels are. There is no alarm on the liver enzimes and my sugar is now at normal levels. On the other hand, the cholesterol is at a highest and the triglycerides are higher than normal, too.

He might ask me how is the exercise going and I think I'll have to tell him the truth. Should I ask about the other estrogen methods? Am I happy on the premarin? I guess I am. My mother asked me how many months I've been in the treatment. It was because of the changes. They are really fast. I am not even at four months and I am full time already.

Full time. I used to read about that and wonder how it would be. There is not a single time of the day I stop being Sofia. At home, with my friends, with my family. Now even at work. Iris, the new psychologist who works with Liliana and Gilda and Cathy and me, my new coworker has met me and is the first person who doesn't know my past. She is the first and only person to only know Sofia.

"Have you met each other?" asked us Lili. I don't remember her face but Catherine does. She said how she does remember our faces and pointed at the both of us. Had she seen me as a man before?

It doesn't matter.

I did not go to the United States as we had planned. Other day it will be. Both my mom and my dad came home and we left to the restaurant. I ordered a pita filled with meat. The waitresses did not gendered me, there was no need. My father pointed at me and did not say my name nor a pronoun as he had called Luis before. It was relieving. Maybe I am ready to the wedding after all.

Luis took pictures of all of us. My mom and my grandma took other ones with me at the fountain. My mom has one with just me. That is the one I like the most. She told me how Lydia, the mother of the twins, called her this morning to congratulate her and said how she was very proud of me, she admired me so much. She congratulated her as well for having a wonderful daughter.

I am her daughter. This is... new.

This is my life, this is how it feels to be alive. It is amazing.

Tomorrow Catherine will pick me up. I'll accompany her to her blood tests and she'll drive me to the endocrinologist. Today the secretary of the dr called me in the morning and asked me if he could see me earlier.

Before of that were the dreams. The first one I remember, I was walking out of school. I was not me, I was a grade school girl. At first I thought I was invisible, but no, I just had no parents... I saw the different ones as if I could choose who would take me. My body was one of a child but my mind was calculating and with a purpose. I found a woman who was perfect. Did I have to convince her to take me? I remember I she was getting on her car and I threw a rock to her windshield. She got of it and came looking. Behind her were a police car that got out and ran over her.

"This will do..." I thought moving over my next target. It was a grown man in a pick up. I talked to him and said something. I convinced him in a way. I got up and he drove. There were car wreckages all alongside the road. He ran over several people as well. What had I done? There were some kind of point system? Was he doing it on purpose? Was I in danger?

The dream changed in a way and we got out in this kind of building. Were we in a test? This was some kind of prototype of a game?

I sat besides a baby. He told me how he had seen love, real love. He felt the warmth of her caring smile caressing all his body. His life was because of her. He could not speak, he was a baby. How did I understand him? I looked at the tag in his head and is said something horrifying. What I thought was motherly love, wasn't. He was the father. Someone used his seed to make a new baby. He was to be disposed now. As if they farmed his dna. He was a disposable genetic material for procreation.

I thought something, and the woman who passed me by turned towards me and said: excuse me?

Did she hear me?

The next dream was different. It was an office, maybe in the same building. There was a line of cubicles with computers and a person to fill it and every spot. There was a problem with the network. When they finally resolved it, the doors locked and they all died. Was it poisoned gas or electroshocks from the terminals? Who was I?

What was I doing in there?

### 2016-08-19

Let's do this.

I have 53 minutes left until midnight. I was lying in bed just moments ago besides my mother. We talked about everything. The first times I left the house with woman's clothes, how I felt, the meaning behind my name and April as my proto-name, to her conversation with her coworkers and the reactions of the family.

 I went to the doctor today. Catherine picked me up a little before my mother left the house. I showered after my dad. Just my mother saw me with the tunic and the red leggings combining with the red shade of my lips. She told me how she was meaning to post the pictures on her Facebook, she even asked my dad. "As you wish", he said.

"And yesterday that we were in the dinner, I saw him and he was inhibited but not fully uncomfortable. He wasn't overly aware of his surroundings or extra attentive to other's people sights or faces. He felt the presence of other woman. Now it's not just me."

In the morning when she talked about the pictures she continued about her hesitation. She doesn't care that her coworkers know about this or their reaction. It was that this is not the way for my godmother to know and see me. She told me how she thought about going to her and telling her. Share this, in person.

Catherine arrived and we left. The first stop was the health clinic were she dropped her stool samples and we waited until they drew her blood. In the waiting room there was a woman with a baby. He smiled and looked at me and I returned the playful gesture. When we left she was seating in the driver's seat of the van besides us. She smiled as we exchanged looks. Did she notice? Did she clock me?

Catherine drove me to the meeting with the endocrinologist. We were just in time. The guard welcomed us as ladies and I signed the sheet. This time there were no credentials. Upped the stairs we got in the waiting room. The receptionist was a different woman who doesn't know me. I had to say how I had an appointment and declare my name. As time passes it does get easier.

Inside with the dr he asked me how I've been. Since when did we see us? Two months, and did I have my blood drawn? Yeah. He asked about my mammary glands, my breasts. How are they? I mentioned the sensitivity and aches. He asked for the volume. Yeah, it has changed, too. Headaches? Taquicardia? Leg pains?

He checked my weight, and my reflexes and blood pressure and my blood levels and touched my liver and appendix and all those internal stuff.

The T levels diminished even more. Everything is fine and well. He congratulated me on those numbers and hoped for everything to continue perfectly. The next meeting will be in four months. I'll continue with the same regimen.

From there we walked to the car and she drove me to the pharmacy. I used the lower discount card so I would not have issues with the other one with Ivan's name and picture. I bought the asepxia tissues and gel for Luis. I asked only for the spiro pills.

We ate breakfast in the place we usually eat breakfast. The waiter referred to us as ladies. Everything went well.

Catherine said there was this place she wanted to visit where they have all this kinds of clothes and dresses. We got inside and I felt unease with the different clothes. I could not differentiate from the good and the bad ones. I felt ignorant.

Lastly we went to the university. I saw Cabrales and Viloria. Neither of them added me to the new profile. Did they recognize me? I know Yadira did. She asked us how we were. We got both letters and there was no problem with my name. I didn't even had to say it out-loud.

My mom came home late at night, she went with her friends for a drink, was it because of me? She came to my room and lied besides me. The conversation started because of that. My godmother took it well. There was a reaction in her face and confusion but mostly acceptance. She was offended when my mother mentioned the possibility of her rejection.

They knew about me. The teacher who sees my mother as a mother figure saw my post on her profile congratulating her on her birthday. I said "mom", and she got jealous. Who was this lost daughter? She stalked my profile and saw the pictures. Again I looked a lot to Ivan. The similarities were astounding. She got to the manifesto. She read it and found the cause of my mom's recent distress. This is the change she was talking about.

Some of them knew.

The conversation was how she had it in her for so long, why did Miguel not say something before, how my father is coming to terms with it. Having patience. Accepting, supporting.

There are more and more mother and daughter conversations lately. Is this how it feels to have a real connection with your family? Is this how support feels like?

### 2016-08-20

I took my mother's advice. I'm home, already changed and I'm wearing a different set of sandals and other shorts that are not Ivan's. Even though I am in pajamas now, I still have the bra on. The shirt that I took from Catherine is what I have on top. We did go to the United States. I did not ask to Ross nor mentioned the wedding.

Yesterday I had asked and they confirmed it. I put the alarm to wake me up early enough. Were we going to go or not, I oughted to get up in the morning. Liliana canceled yesterday our meeting to give us the manuals and formats. As I got up Luis was already in the living room, changed and watching tv. It was 7 in the morning. Later would he tell me that he got up before 6. The whole day he was struggling to stay awake.

I showered and changed. I wore the red blouse and gray jeggings. I put on my makeup and thought I looked fine. This would be another day with my family. Other time I would cross the border en femme. Time passed and everything got into place. We left the house at 10 in the morning. We would all go to the office for me to get the papers and from there would we go. In the excess time we had before hand, we stopped in the bank. My mother stayed waiting and my dad drove me to the office. I waited just a couple of minutes in her waiting room. I looked at myself in the mirror across the couch. The text I sent her stayed unseen when we met. She greeted me complimenting me on my looks. "Good morning, my pretty girl". Later, inside the conversation she reinforced her own compliment confirming that I do look really beautiful. I thanked her and smiled while I had the papers in my arms.

We picked up my mom and crossed the border. The first place we stopped was the currency exchange booth. My dad took off and my mother gave Luis a 500 bill, then another one to me and finally, the last one to Luis. He went to exchange it.

We ate breakfast in the Jack in the Box. I ordered a different item from the menu. The buttery I don't know what jack or burger. It was fine.

We went to Target. I got separated from them and directed myself to the ladies section. It feels surreal to look for clothes there normally. Exploring the area without worry, putting blouses against my body not caring who is beside me or looking, when would I imagine I'd do it without a second thought? I bought two blouses and a blue tank top. I did not try any of them until home, they all fit fine. The blue one is a little tight. Miguel got lost and my mother stayed in the cafeteria. Miguel got out of the dressing room. While they were in line to the cashier I looked for shorts to be around the house. I keep thinking the words my mom told me. They see me in Ivan's clothes. They see him when I'm wearing them. I don't want that. I wish I could have what Catherine described that other day: "I would still wear the clothes until they don't fit me anymore, until my body doesn't match them. I would want to see the mismatch between us, and see me outgrown them."

I looked in the sales area and got between two girls chatting. They were commenting the clothes and exchanging exclamations and observations. Did they see me, notice me? When I let the one behind me pass, she excused herself. Would they talk about that person in that area? Was that a girl or a boy?

Yesterday in the school, when we were waiting for the letter from the principal office, I thought I heard one the three med students ask, "is that a girl? a young man?" I paid no attention and let the words go. I wasn't sure, and even if they were mustered, I would not know their meaning.

I found the shorts and chose two. I'll wear them in Mexicali with Catherine. The day after tomorrow we'll leave the city. We'll be together for a week. From monday until friday, like we used to be in school. Except we'll share the nights as well. It's amazing specially because of the nights and the mornings.

### 2016-08-21

The baggage is almost ready. The clothes and underwear and towel and shoes are all in there. In the box that Luis gave me I put under lock the condoms, the bottle of lubricant and the vibrator. It's almost full. The bag with toiletries is the only thing that's left to put. Just now as I turn towards my bed, the thought of not going to sleep here after today for a week hit me. Will I take the pillow with me? Will it fit?

I am excited. As much excited that I don't even care about the name or the situation. Will I say Sofia when they ask ours for the ticket? I don't know, maybe. The only thing that matters is that I'll be with Catherine for the week. My father will take both my brothers to school tomorrow. My mom, anyway, will leave early, she has to arrange and set her classroom. I think I will get to the bus station in an uber. It will be the first time that I ask and take one for myself. It will appear Sofia in there.

I went and asked my mother for glue. After pasting the cover and back cover back to the notebook I planned to take, I have decided that I'll take the red moleskine instead. I keep thinking, trying to decide if I take or not my purse. I feel a thousand times more comfortable with it than with the gray backpack.

Why? It's not specifically male. Catherine likes it. I don't know.

I keep getting myself distracted instead of finishing this and getting to sleep. Tomorrow I have to wake up early so I finish setting everything up and leaving with time. I am nervous.

Tomorrow will be the start of a new week. Luis will go to school, my mom will start with classes. I will leave the city for a week. This will be the longest I'll sleep with Catherine. We will buy the groceries together and prepare our own food.

I think about the uber to the bus station, the morning routine and race with time. I think about saying or not my name to the clerk of the bus and getting to my grandma's and what will happen in the school there. I haven't given a thought about Edgar's reaction. What does he expect? He took it alright according to my mother and grandma... but, I think I fear the accepting ones even more. They tend to take it lightly and playfully. It's way more comfortable the awkward silence of tense people, their try of pretending that nothing has changed.

This morning my godmother sent me a friend. I accepted without a second thought. Yesterday my mother had said how she told her she pretended to talk with me. Maybe that was it. She commented on my profile with greetings and good wishes and the support of all her family. She called me goddaughter and it felt nice. Again, I was sure that was it.

I got up from bed and looked out to see all of the cars. I opened the fridge with the intention to heat my one week old biscuit. I was just about to set the time when I decided against it. It went to the thrash. Moments later my dad got in with bags from the convenience store and the paper bag with the characteristic yellow star.

I ate my food and went to the bathroom. Exiting my mother called me and said my godmother just asked her if she could call me. I was entering the bathroom so she told her I was eating. I was free now, wasn't I? Sure. I was petrified on the inside. The mismatch between they knowing and my voice discomforts me. What do they expect to hear Ivan? They know how I look now, how do they think I sound? How do I sound?

The conversation or what she had to say to me was something secondary. I brought the clothes from the drying machine and was folding them when the phone rang. I answered anxiously but surely. She said good morning with a joyous candace in her voice. How was I, fine, how was her. She asked to call because maybe we all had an occupied night yesterday and you never know... Yeah, I know...

Then she said: "And how is the planning going?" Wait, what? Oh. She thought I was my mother...

"uh, I am not Laura". She laughed nervously, surprised and shock. I could hear through the phone how everything made sense. Yeah, I am not a man now, has my voice changed that much? Wow.

It's not the first time I've been mistaken as my mother. Why did this feel different? Why was this so reassuring and comforting?

### 2016-08-22

I waited for you under the rain two hours, a thousand hours, like a dog. When you arrived, you looked at me and told me "Crazy, I don't love you anymore".

The first time I heard that song I was in high school with Mariana. It was my first concert. Everything ... I lost track of that thought. It doesn't matter. I'm sitting with Catherine by my side eating Edgar's food. We are in Mexicali.

I woke up this morning early. I got up from bed just as my dad and brothers were leaving home. It was just a couple of minutes after six. I got in the shower and started the routine. My mother was supposed to be leaving home by that time but she was not awaken by her alarm.

The luggage was all set and ready. I talked with Catherine just as she woke up. The morning past and the free time I had I used to eat breakfast and watched the first half of the Spider-man movie.

Catherine would be taken to bus station by her mother. My mother had left already so I was just alone. I had decided to take an uber. I called for it minutes before nine.

I left the house with my red blouse and denim shorts. My lips were red and my lashes full. One man was walking with thrash bags to the container. He passed me by and greeted me without gendering me. The uber approached and I waved to him. I got in after putting my luggage. He said something to me but I did not understand.

"Would you come to the front seat? The taxi drivers at the bus station might get a little aggressive." Sure, of course.

The drive went calm and silent. The voice from the radio station was talking about Trump and his searching for the latino vote.

"Do you believe him?" I just laughed and told him no.

He left me there and I waited for a little while. I was early. The time we accorded to was 9:20. There were some people with their baggage waiting there. One of them looked at me, he was a young boy. I caught three pokemon. I had my aunt's number in a pink piece of paper. I was nervous with the idea of calling her. How would I introduce myself? What voice should I use?

"My own" and the answer seems so obvious, and yet I doubted it. Which one is mine? Do I need to fake my voice? Is the natural one not mine?

Catherine asked me to see the timetables. The next buses would go out at 10:30, an hour after she would arrive. When she came, I went out the help her out of the car. Her mother saw me before her. She asked the woman behind the counter of Aguacalientes' Buses. She informed us the next one would leave in five minutes. She asked us if we were students. Catherine answered with the truth.

She asked for our names, Catherine went first. She looked at me, but Catherine's voice was faster. "Sofia Fernandez". It was done. Later would she notice how she gave us two of the six seats reserved for women.

I sent a text message to my mother and Catherine to hers. I typed the message to my aunt. I preferred that to calling her. Maybe that wasn't the correct choice.

We both fell asleep on our way here. I first and then she reclined her head to take her turn. When we woke up we kissed as we hadn't in a long, long time. Neither of us gave a thought to the people who could see us.

Leaving the Rumorosa, as the first moment I got signal, I called my aunt. "Hi, Aunt Cruz, I am Sofia, the daughter of Laura..." I told her how we were on our way. She was waiting already at the bus station. For a moment it felt awkward, was she annoyed?

She brought us home, and my grandma welcomed us. We walked towards the school and look for refuge from the heat in the cafeteria. She ordered a sandwich and I a yakimeshi. It was weirder than the last time I was in the university, even though here nobody knows me. I was in a classroom, paying attention, surrounded by people.

"I'm just waiting for the two people who would come from Tijuana" Javier asked. He was talking about us.

"Which one is Catherine? And you?"

"Sofia"



### 2016-08-23

This was the second day of the course. We're home now. The door was open, Edgar was waiting for us.

Yesterday we had sex. After returning from the class, Edgar was already here. I introduced Catherine to him and he cooked his chicken for today. He had said to my grandma how he wanted to talk to his "little sister", I'd be lying if I say that I was not nervous or even a little afraid of what he could had wanted to say to me. He made no mention of the elephant in the room. He treated just as he always has. It was the little things as he referred to the feminine plural to us, or called us "Sofia, Catherine, the chicken is ready if you want to eat".

The only kind of mention was a subtle question with a look: "how is everyone back home?"

He said he would be leaving to change a tire, he'd be back soon. Catherine and I went to bed and fooled around. I teased her a little and she wanted to go further. Edgar would be back at any moment and the danger of being caught was exhilarating.

I made no mention of the fucking we did in yesterday's words. I don't remember if we took all of our clothes off. We touched each other. We took out a condom and tried to put it on my member. The cum was minimal but the orgasm dumbfounding. It was globally and way more intense than other times. I felt an explosion from the tip of my genitals irradiating to my whole body, a pulsating wave of pleasure.

We went to sleep. We woke up in the middle of the night and continued. "What time is it?" "3 in the morning", she answered back in a whisper. "Oh, that's why I'm barely awake".

The session continued a couple hours later after falling and coming back to sleep. This time I made her come. We would get up later in the morning and continued where we left off. This time I made her come again. We showered and dressed. We went to the market and bought groceries for the rest of the week.

I made her breakfast and she cooked lunch. We ate eggs with a salsa of fresh tomatoes and she prepared tuna with a can of mixed vegetables.

We watched the first episode of Stranger Things in Netflix. After it finished we walked to school. The plan was born on our way there. Maybe we could order an uber to take us to Hookahfe, the cafe with Hookahs, after class. I sent Edgar a text message telling him we would be late and not to worry about us.

The class finished 20 minutes after time it should had ended. Today the class was about the history of Neuropsychology, its general terms and basic syndromes. Again it was mostly information that we already now, although the review was pretty useful. The new terms were few but was the whole worth of today's class.

After walking out, I ordered the uber and raced it to the meeting point. Catherine sat in the front row and again was asked if she was Sofia. I wonder sometimes how people really see me. In the class, do they see me as one of the girls who came from Tijuana, or am I the weird androgynous person who might be a transvestite man or an unfortunately woman.

Maybe they don't notice me at all.

No, I am not invisible.

The uber took us to the cafe and we entered, the waitress asked us if we were ready in the feminine, and gendered us that way the whole time. She was nice and attentive. Did I mishear when she told the couple in front of us she would take their tea pitcher "for them [masculine]"? Probably, the only difference is a vowel, and even then it would be the general neutral way. I did not focused on that like other days.

We smoked a hookah with mixed shisha of coffee and vanilla, and the base was filled with milk. Catherine ordered a hot dog with chilli.

We decided to go eat dinner. In the university she was starving. We walked around and went to a grill and ordered three tacos each. They were tasty. The waiters again called us girls. The last one even made a comment of how he could set the bill in the middle as we were both woman.

"How do you feel with being out?", she asked me once while we ate. I forget about it, and that's the best thing of all. I can just forget that I have something to worry about. I, finally, just enjoy being me while being with her.

### 2016-08-24

I'm sitting at the table right now. Catherine is eating her instant soup and we both have a glass of beer with clam juice.

We woke up again, this time I got up from a dream and went to the bathroom. In the dream I juggled different appointments and struggle to remember which was with whom and when. I was outside of a psych consultation room, I was waiting for my therapist. Yolanda came out and gave me a present.

I woke up and went to the bathroom. When I returned to bed I saw how Catherine noted my absence and hugged me from behind as I accompanied her under the sheets.

Later in the morning we started fooling around with our hands and the vibrators. We were both naked and moaning and I had the blue toy between her legs, she was closed to coming when suddenly asked me to stop.

We made breakfast, this time it was her turn. She prepared ham and eggs. We sided them with the white rice Edgar had made Monday. We showered and got ready. We had the plans of going to the Mall downtown. We might look around for a dress or a wallet. I wore the white dress. I applied a little make up and thought I looked fine. I didn't even care much about the razor machine. I just passed it once without glasses before entering the shower.

I ordered the uber and he picked us up from the front door. He left us there and the first store we visited was Sears. We looked around and firstly saw a blue dress, crossed in the front, elegant and formal. The price was high but razonable. I thought about buying, I could take it with me to a fitting room. We continued looking around and got to the area of dresses. After browsing them, we decided to pick three different ones. One black, and two blue.

We entered together to the fitting room and the first one I tried was the long one, Catherine had picked it. She helped me putting it over my head and shoulders and zipping it up. I looked fine.

Just now I'm returning from the bathroom, it's the fourth time today that I go and sit and try to evacuate. It's fruitless. Just gas and clear water. I feel my stomach bloated. I feel fat and a little ugly. Maybe that's why I wondered after exiting the store how people saw me. I walked around the whole day in a white dress, but did people really see a young woman? I saw no judging sights nor doubting faces. There were no strange comments and the people who gendered me all did it correctly. It was all in my head.

"I got a little sad after the boutiques" "You got saddened by yourself"... "That's what I said"

We were wandering about the mall, looking for different boutiques were we could find other dresses. Each one was another hit to my self-image. The number of items were fewer and from the ones they did have, just a fraction were even a size possible of fitting me. From the three dresses that we brought, just one fit. Another didn't close and the third one I couldn't even pass my head through the neck hole. My bigger head than normal, my non-female gigantic head.

The first boutique we got into, the seller saw us enter. Catherine asked her for dresses in the bigger sizes. She showed us the few she had and made the comment of how the rest of the bigger ones were not in a young style but the ones older women would wear.

She later tried to make more nice comments or helping suggestions, but by them I just wanted to get out.

As my mood continued to get worse, I thought Catherine had gotten a little sick of me. I asked her what she wanted to do and she answered back with a question: "Do you want to go home?" I saw a glimpse of disappointed doubt, but ended confirming it. We got back home and I prepared the pasta.

In my urge of getting it all right, of returning the favor of cooking this time, I almost-ruined everything. I had to change clothes to avoid spilling my dress. We ate the pasta and the leftovers from Edgar's chicken.

In the class, there was a girl who started a conversation with me, then other guy came and asked if we were the ones that really came from Tijuana. Do we come and go everyday? Were are we staying? The girl looked a lot like Andrea. Catherine would later pass me a note with the same message.

The master asked a question and as I whispered the answer to Catherine, he heard the right one from our side. He gendered me female, too. "She said it first"

Later, making a comment of how us, the girls from Tijuana were beating them, asked us for the topographical diagnosis of a Wernicke's Aphasia. He didn't expect us to answer.

And yet I said:

"The third posterior area of the superior... temporal gyrus?"

"Give the points to her"

I was happier to hear the her, than the appreciation to my correct answer.

### 2016-08-25

We laughed in bed, we laughed out loud, those times when you can't stop, and your stomach hurts and you even cry a little. We were trying of thinking of names for a pet. I said that I had thought about Luria, the last name of the father of modern neuropsychology. I remember about Paulino, one of my classmates in Salamanca, he has a cat. His name is either Freud or Sigmund. I think it's Freud. I could name my dog Luria. We tried to recall the series and books we like. Game of thrones? What about Khalessi... No, I'd prefer Daenerys. Hodor?

Series, like Daredevil, maybe foggy. Or Luke and Killergrave from Jessica Jones. Maybe Sherlock, she liked it but I didn't.

The motive of our laughs was that we thought about Luria, Alexandra might offend Paola. So, maybe a part of the brain? Which are the cool named ones? Hippocampus? Nah, Broca, or Wernicke, maybe... We named the meninges, pia madre, dura madre... that other part named putamen. We started laughing. I tried to say them out loud but said instead Puta madre, mixing both of them. She even cried a little.

Why were we thinking of names of pets?

Yesterday my aunt called in the afternoon to invite us to eat lunch at her house. We were just finishing the pasta I made. I felt a little bad turning her off, but accepted her offer to postpone. Even today we had in mind she might call us again to confirm.

We were in bed watching Stranger things when I heard the fence tingle. She knocked into the window and I opened her the door. She said she came for us to pick us up, she might take us to school. Had we eaten? We told her the truth so she said we could go to her house to eat and then she take us to the university.

Catherine put her shoes and we left. I was wearing the black blouse with the white vest. Underneath I had the burgundy jeans. She is wearing shorts and a white t-shirt of the beatles. We are both at the table right now, with a glass each of beer and clam juice.

When we got to her house I hoped nobody were home. I worried a little too, about what were we going to eat. Getting in I heard the cries of little animals. She has two little puppies. They were so small they could even fit in my shoe. They were white little balls of fur with four legs to crawl on the floor. We sat at the table for her to finish slicing the lettuce. I felt tiny nails scratching my feet and look down to find one trying to climb my foot. She used her tiny paws to get on my leg. Catherine said she was trying to find the warmth of her mother.

I envy sometimes Catherine and her relationship with her dog. I wish I could had or have something of the like. I've had dogs before. The first one was Sparky. And he was actually mine. But he never acknowledged me. He was mine, but I never were his. He wouldn't had recognized me. I was afraid of him until they took him away and died. The second one was Max, he was a white pitbull but his stay was short and we never really got to know each other. I was still afraid of him. The first one was given to us by my godmother and Jessica, the second by the Tae Kwon Do teacher. My grandmother took him to Mexicali and then gave him to someone else, he died too, a little after.

The last dog that lived with us was Stitch. I wasn't afraid of him. But never really tried to bond either. He wasn't mine, I didn't want him. Was I scared of him dying? Was I trying to avoid not getting to know him, too? That he, even after all that time would never recognize me either.

I have never liked feeling invisible.

So this time I was hesitant to even acknowledge the want of staying with the little puppy on my feet. I wanted her to come home with me, to sleep by my room and give me the chance to take care of her. I like the idea of being the carer of another. Having some one more fragile than me, more needing of care. Feeling useful and accompanied. Needed and loved.

Maybe I will ask my aunt to the chance of staying with her and name her.

### 2016-08-26

We are home once again. This is the last night we're going to sleep together in my grandma's bed. This is the end of our short practice as living partners. I try to recall the many things we did and visited and I can't help to smile. She is right behind me snooping like many of the last nights. I don't mind her eyes. I don't have to worry about her judging me.

We saw the last chapter of Stranger Things last night. We started the series as we got here. My aunt brought us from the bus station and my grandma welcomed us. Tomorrow, the same aunt will drive us there and my grandma will expect me home.

This morning Catherine woke me. This was the latest I've gotten up since we got here. I dreamed something but can't remember it. Catherine had the breakfast ready. She cooked the potatoes with the chorizo we bought, she prepared it just for us. This morning I went to the bathroom and finally stop leaking clear water.

I asked Catherine for her help to decide the clothes I'd wear. She picked the long-tailed blouse. So, if my aunt would pick us up again, she'd see me femininely. We were lying in bed doing or talking I don't remember what. When we started kissing and touching each other. The heat of the moment embraced us and did what nature expected from us. I kissed her lips and neck, she touched my breasts and nibbled my nipples. I went down her chest, her stomach, I bit her underwear and kissed under it. We both knew what was coming next. I pushed my lips trough the cloth of her panties. Her lubricant's taste surrounded my mouth. I caressed her clitoris with the point of my tongue, moved it around trying to control her moans.

Today I asked her to penetrate me. I wanted her inside of me. I love the feeling of being dominated, owned by her, being totally under her control.

We fooled around on the bed, switching who was with her eyes closed and her legs opened. Finally, as we were both to coming, she proposed having our clitorises together. We came at the same time, like those memories I cherish.

We showered together. This time it wasn't passionate or even erotic. It was functional, practical. More than anything it was intimate.

We ate as practical as we got ready. I made a sandwich, fresh with mayo and ham, slices of tomato and cucumber. She made herself with the bread toasted and hot. I sliced the rest of the cucumber and put it into two separate containers. She put the sauces and the clamato juice. I crushed the churritos, and put them into mine. She would wait to get to the university or the store and buy a bag of tostitos.

We were talking in bed when my phone rang and was my aunt. She said she was home and asked if we ate already for us to eat at her house. I said we had, but could go and stay a while with her if she wanted. I had thought the night before about telling her, saying something about wanting to keep one of the puppies. We even talked about names. It was becoming more and more real. The want wasn't just a game or a fantasy anymore. It was becoming something more, a wish that could lead to disappointment and lose. It's a little scary.

The phone rang a little while later. This time it was my cousin saying he was outside. We got our things and left home. He drove us and made chit chat. He didn't seem nervous or bothered. Didn't I really have anything to worry? Is this going to be like with everybody else?

I played with the puppies and mentioned my wish to keep them. My aunt commented how it would be good to not separate them. I could keep and care one, but two of them?

My aunt served us some of the food she made anyway. We ate it and spent the hour before school with them. Valeria came and saw us. How does she see me? She never really knew me before. She had met me, but... how is it for her? I never knew somebody like me.

In the university we had the last session. Javier made the mention and honored us for coming from Tijuana. We stayed a while with him afterwards.

We went to Hookahfe again, this time we ordered a hookah flavored with grape and the base was of red wine.

The uber home kept referring us as girls. Even after me talking, he called us girls.

Do I pass? Can I be comfortable now presenting outside, going to the restroom?

Can I keep my guard down and let myself be? What more do I need?


### 2016-08-27

I'm home and yet I feel homesick. The feeling that cursed me when I returned from Spain, that unfamiliarity and strangeness that stank the bed that was supposed to welcome me. I see the bed all made and clean, waiting for me to rest in it, my comfortable pillows and used-to mattress. I thought I would miss it. I miss Catherine now.

I was seeing the pictures of this last week. Our smiles and playful faces, the videos of us preparing and cooking breakfast. I love us even more seeing the cheerful faces with unkept hair and night clothes. I love the feeling of the hotness of her body warming me under the fresh sheet. I'll miss the ability to reach her waking up in the night. Feeling missed and welcomed as I return from the bathroom.

This was supposed to be a try or mock-up of what we could expect living together. Doing the grocery shopping and exchanging turns of doing the dishes and cooking. How underestimated is the pleasure of asking someone to come to bed with you.

Just now I feel my throat hugging itself and my eyes watering. Is the homesickness and nostalgia of the week or the coming back of the consciousness of the condition I'm in here?

We had to get up early in the morning to get ready for when my aunt would pick us up. The alarm started its song at 7 in the morning. I asked her to postponed it and she agreed. I appreciated every extra minute as a treasure. We showered and got ready. Our baggage was set and done. We had talked about going to taste the pig meat tacos. Edgar showered after me. He asked me when would we like to leave, he could give us a ride. I told him not to worry, my aunt already proposed to take us. We would leave in a couple of hours. He said he'd go to the gym then. He said his good-bye. I extended my hand but he denied it. He reached for a hug and I reciprocated it awkwardly. He was really nice, the whole week. He treated me normally, made no comments or showing of discomfort. He used my name, he called us in the feminine. He met Catherine. It all went well, amazingly good. His good-bye was a small scaled remembrance of the period of departures in my time in Spain. The painful signal that the magical bubble period where everything is fantastic was just about to burst.

We walked and order our tacos. Each one of us ordered two. After finishing we made a stop at the place crossing the street. We ate one taco each of birria. The name of the place was Salamanca's tacos.

My aunt came for us and drove us to the station. Our father's picked us up. He made some chit chat. For a little while I ignored the minutes old nervousness of him seeing me with a blouse that shows the contours of my breasts. He asked me how the trip was, how the course went. I talked back and everything felt normal, just like the passed days. My expectations did not come. There is nothing wrong with me, nothing abnormal. I can forget being trans. I'm just me.

He asked me to tell my mom that he had picked me up already, and asked her if she wanted us to come get her. I hesitated at writing the message. Should I had written it from his perspective, would writing Sofia be exceptional to the point of surprise? Would I be able to type Ivan? The feeling came, I remembered again the difficulty of living here, where my past haunts me.

I asked to go to Costco. I've been running out of pills. My mother and father took me. For once I remembered the feeling of being an only child. We met my godmother there. I separated myself and when I turned I saw them saying hi to somebody. I returned and greeted them. She called me "mija", and said how seeing me she wondered "Is that really her?". It was validating, another nod to this successful trip. Even Jose, her son, said nothing, either with his mouth or eyes.

Getting to the line, my mother asked me to exchange an item. I went and returned. I can't remember why I separated again. This time I got lost.

I looked for them, I felt disoriented. When I found them my dad was waving at me. I was far away not to hear them, but close enough to see his lips crearly. My mother turned to him and he made a face of explanation, his lips read "perdido".

I recognized the circling of the mouth that telegraphs the final and masculine O. My mother lift a finger and looked at him with correcting eyes. Her lips were as clear as his and danced just like his, as well, almost the same movements. All but the last one: a final opened aperture marking an ending feminine a. "Perdida". There was an emphasis in that ending.

Weeks ago she was changing the way she referred to me and now she was correcting him.

Why did I feel sick? Why did I wanted the earth to swallow me whole and return me to Mexicali or somewhere else where I would freely forget about my incongruence?

I went and returned from Aidee's. I met her son. At first he was peacefully asleep on his grandparents bed. I sat in front of the mirror and paid attention to what she explained to me.

Yesterday I put the alarm even though I was not going to need to wake up early. I spent the night enjoying my bed, it was hard getting up from bed. I slept most of the night and was as restless as my return in the bus. I postponed the alarm various times. I can't remember the dreams that distracted me from waking up.

My father had just returned from buying breakfast.

Luis is here behind my back.

I took my pills and went to the shower. I hesitated looking for clothes to wear. What could I choose? Should I go feminine or ambiguos? Catherine yesterday told me to wear the white blouse with the jeans I was wearing or the burgundy ones. Both of them are dirty. I took the white blouse and the first pair of jeans she lend me. After showering I put on the gray jeggings and took a blue blouse from the closet. I changed from it, to a green one, then the red one from Guadalajara and finally returned to the first outfit.

Writing this feels tiring. I feel exhausted and look at my bed with desire of closing my eyes and resting.

Why am I avoiding talking about the make up session? I started narrating it. I talked about Aidee and her son, I was sitting in her parent's bedroom waiting for her to bring her things.

She helped me, she explained the uses and types of brushes. She put primer on my face and then foundation in half of my face. The lesson was a little weird. I didn't feel once that I was putting on a disguise or having a make over. I always felt like a woman learning a necessary skill. She never misgendered me once. Even when her sister came she always talked about me in the feminine.

It felt validating, amazing. After the make up, she did my hair. She undid the curls and moved the hairline more to the left.

We went downstairs and continued talking about how I've been, how my parents have taken it, my brothers and family. We talked about Monica. She asked first if she knew about me and I took the chance to say what I've been meaning to take out. I told her about everything. How she broke up with me, how we separated and returned over and over, how in august she saw me for fifteen minutes after nine months of not seeing each other, how in October she told me she was not ready to be my friend and selfishly made this difficult phase and episode of my life about her, how later this year I talked to her and her first response was to ask me if I still doubted I had hurt her, how she told me how no matter what I am, it doesn't change the fact I behaved like an asshole towards her.

"I don't know how you kept talking to her... Did you never see her like that, how she really was?"

Valeria and Omar and all of them excluded her from the group, too. I did know, but did not remember at the time, how she had been with Rupit. They were together for a while in high school. They broke up and she had some meetups with Omar. Did I know that? Maybe, there was something of the like, I think. I had distanced myself from them by then.

Something happened between both of them, she told me... "What do you mean between both of them?"

Omar and Rupit liked each other. Omar told us how he was confused. Maybe he was obsessed with our relationship because he was jealous. He wanted Rupit more than he wanted me.

They talked about it, Rupit felt something similar towards Omar. They got together once and talked about it just the two of them... Did they did something? Surely they kissed at least. I put myself in that place, alone with someone whom I like and feel something towards, knowing that they feel something similar in the same way. I don't see how we would not kiss each other.

Well, I was alone with Monica for months before any of us dared to kiss.

I took a picture and sent it to Catherine, the end result. I told Aidee how I liked it, and I wasn't really lying. It was different, I saw myself new... I didn;t really know hoe I looked.

Tomorrow I'll see her. Maybe I'll buy something.

### 2016-08-29

Finally the day arrived when I could go to the United States, several times we had to cancel and postpone it. This week is the graduation. I woke up early in the morning. Not by four like I had considered, but near 6. I'd be leaving home with my mother, after 8 I'd take the bus to the border and cross to meet Catherine at her school. I got up and showered. I even shaved a little with the razor and brush. In the late night I felt discomfort in my sleep. This concern about turning, this uneasiness in my stomach. I worried while in the shower. I got out of it and stood in front of the toilet. I finally threw up. A brown sugary mixture of donuts and milk and meatballs splashed the water. An electrical tingle crawled through my arms. My legs felt weak and broken, the strong nauseous smell scratched my nostrils. The half digested food came again. I flushed the muddy water and returned to the shower.

I came down stairs and sent a message to Catherine telling her I had thrown up, but I felt better now. I had several of hers telling me she was ready but had thrown up... "Sofia, I threw up again". Yesterday she told me in messages by midnight how she couldn't fall asleep. Her tummy was hard and swollen. I asked her disappointed if she wanted to cancel. I felt frustrated and upset. Once again would we postpone it. She felt really bad, she had diarrhea, she didn't want to drive feeling this way. Maybe later could we go? She'd pick me up.

I felt the nausea again, coming from within, crawling through my viscera with its long and bony fingers. I went with my mother and told her I had thrown up and would not go. I returned to bed and lied down to sleep. The morning I spent in a conflicted slumber. I tossed and torn with the nausea pushing my insides with every change of position. I felt the acidness of the gastric juices burning my throat. I wanted to vomit again and the mere thought of it made me sicker.

At first I was disappointed with Catherine's decision to cancel. Even though she proposed to see how we went along the morning, I couldn't had gone. The whole morning passed under my sheets in sweat and nightmares. I got up after two. Cande had made me chicken and rice. I was not hungry. I didn't want to take the pills because of the fear of throwing them up with the breakfast. I cut one of the chickens in half and served it with a generous spoonful of white steamed rice. One mouthful of the spicy animal was enough to realize it was a bad idea. I returned it to the pan and scrambled two eggs with three cherry tomatoes. Maybe the freshness of it would be a better option.

I finished and ate it with the rice. The last spoons were hard to swallow. I forced myself to finish leaving more than half the fresh fruits. I lied in the couch and watched something. Was it a movie or was it a series? I think it was the unfinished episode of The strain I did not completed yesterday.

I returned to bed and answered the messages to Catherine and Anahi. Would I be healthier tomorrow to redo the plans? Wednesday we will meet with Anahi after my therapy. Thursday is the graduation of jhonny and Saturday it's the party.

The days keep passing by, it seems as if it was planned on purpose. The day will come and I won't have the clothes nor shoes to wear.

I slept again with the stomach sensitive and fragile. My mom and brother came, little after my dad and Miguel got in, too.

Should I had gone to the doctor? I was scared. I feared the reaction or way of treating me I would face. Either I'd go with Hector, the doctor who knows me and has treated me almost all of my life, or I would avoid him and decide to go to a fresh out of school youngun in the clinics attached to the pharmacies. What name would I give? Would they respect it? How would I look with the gloomy cloud of sickness over me.

I trembled and cried in bed. After my mom and dad left somewhere I asked my grandma to cook me a soup and it calmed the rest of the symptoms that the paracetamol did not tame.

I am still a little scared. About the doctor, about the week and the clothes and the rush, about throwing up again and feel the weakness crush me to bed once again.

### 2016-08-30

I know Xennia since we were both 4 years old. I learn to write and read with her. I think I remember that she was the first girl I kiss. I innocently walked towards her and planted a childish kiss on her cheek. She wiped her face and nothing happened. Today she knew about me.

I went to sleep sickish and spent the night drowned in sweat. Did I have feverish nightmares? No. I didn't woke up with nausea or the urges to run to the bathroom. I woke up early, before dawn. I heard the voices of my grandma and one of my brothers. Who was it? She offered to make him something, he answered back. Luis.

I got up and drank water to cover the taste of acid in my throat. I returned to bed and went back to slumber. My grandma came later and brought me a bowl of soup, the can I found yesterday of chicken and rice. I remembered how I got up and taste it. I could see the memory, the sensations of the hot plate and the metallic spoon bringing the broth to my mouth. I turned to find the plate still steaming and unmoved.

I heard the vibrations of the phone. Catherine told me early how she would have to go today to school to be an hour in the computer lab. She'd meet a classmate there to copy the notes of the week she was absent. I heard the vibrations of a new text again. I turned to the wall and kept my eyes closed. 'Maybe it's her, she's telling me to catch up to her, we could go shopping. I should picked it up'.

I decided not to, and slept again.

An hour later I finished the soup and read the texts. She had arrived earlier than she thought. She invited me to go, then, in my silence, she reminded herself I felt bad, I could not got.

No, I had nausea again, I couldn't, could I?

We talked a little. I should try to shower anyway. I wanted to, the other option is going Thursday before the act and find something. But... I feel pressured enough, what if I don't find anything? The times we've looked I've bought short dresses. Catherine herself told me how she has find the long ones she's bought.

I showered and got ready. Catherine told me to take it easy, see how feel. I put the attire I had set up for yesterday. The red leggings and long tunic that my grandma fixed me. I did my hair lazily and put up just enough make up to look different.

My grandma asked me if I felt better and if I would go out. I told her yes. Did I honestly feel better? No, I had my doubts. The symptoms stayed I tried to ignore and deny them. I left and drove.

In the parking I waited behind just one car. He entered just moments after I stopped. Not much passed before another car left and I got his spot. I walked to the pedwest border. From the parking lot I headed to the old one and up the bridge, I crossed it to the other side, the ramp besides the river. On the way there, two or three people referred to me as miss.

There was no line. I got to the building without stopping, I decided to put the sentri away and cross normally. The patrol officer asked the usual questions and said nothing. I went to the plaza by myself, Catherine told me she would catch up with me later. I would be looking by myself first.

I got to Ross and felt the freshness of the wet spots in my back. The black sweat marks were like spots on a tiger skin. I had them on my chest and my stomach and different parts of my upper and lower back. I kept wiping sweat from my brow, cold water from a cold skin.

Was it the fever or the walk?

I looked around but did not what I was looking for. I went to the bathroom and met with Catherine later. I bought four dresses. Two long black ones, one for the graduation and another for the wedding. Catherine loved the last one. I looked pretty.

The other two are red. One for a night out and the other for the ceremony.

We came back.

Catherine met with Xennia. She knows about me. She had seen a picture of me in Facebook. It wasn't one I posted, it was the one Catherine published with me and Luis. "Is that Ivan? Who is that kid, I know him, but why does it appear another name?"

I do look different, I look fine, happier.

Her sister has a girlfriend, too.

I knew them, met them when I was just a child. When would I imagine that little girl would be a lesbian, or that I would be a girl and a lesbian.

Aren't we supposed to be abnormal?

### 2016-08-31

A year ago the talk about her parents wedding started. I remember it well, being in the car when she told me the date. "Next year by September. I'm planning on inviting everybody, you know?" The thought crossed both of our minds. Lots of time until that date, who knows what could happen. By then it wasn't the gang's graduation yet, I knew I'd be wearing a tux to that, that's why the doubt of my attendance was another theme of conversation. Maybe by march both of out parents would know, maybe I wouldn't need to be wearing a suit and tie to that. "Who knows, maybe by that time everybody knows about me, maybe I'd be already changing and I'd attend as me, can you imagine it?"

A year passed and with it, lots of the things that we thought would changed. Both graduations passed. The first one of our friends was the painful night I started on antidepressants and they were not enough to take the pain of pretending. I left by the middle of the party. We both told our moms. We both wanted to tell more people and looked for ways to find the courage. I made the appointment to the endocrinologist and our graduation came up. I wore a suit again, but this time was by my choosing. I dealt with it fine. It was the last time I'd be wearing one of those things. Did I know it then? I started hormones. I started changing, I told the rest of my family and the world. Catherine told her father. Tomorrow will be a third graduation, our first as graduates. My first return to the school with a dress. I have the dress ready for the party, the first one where I'll attend in a gown. I have the dress ready for the wedding. We are invited, she did invite all of our friends. Her family will be there, mine will be there... I'll be there.

This morning I was finally recovered. The only ill feeling I woke with was a pulsing headache as I stood on my feet. My grandma had fried potatoes and left some in a plate for me, she put apart some chorizo if I wanted to mix them up. I fried two eggs and ate it as breakfast. It was just a little more than an hour before noon. I was exhausted. I finished eating and took the pills. I've lost count of the days I've been on them. I turned at the mirror and stop looking for differences. I see my face in the reflection and don't have to worry about my hair or the hairs of my chin or the masculine attributes that I want to disappear.

I start to feel the calm I read so much about. I can rest now. I have the sandals and the dress. Aidee set the appointment to the make up and hair. Everything is done. I thought about showing my grandma and mother the pictures of me wearing the dress for the wedding. They will see me this weekend as I get ready to the grad.

Tomorrow I'll see jhonny, I might see gabriela and victor. I might see other people visiting them. Maybe Garab, Theresa? Maybe Ivan or Felix. Am I nervous? Am I nervous about seeing a teacher? Some know about me, what about the rest? Would I say hi?

I am sweating, is this heat or nervousness?

I'll wear one of the new dresses tomorrow. The clothes are all set and ready. Before picking Catherine up I'll take my grandma to buy more shakiras and pearls for her to finish the ankle bracelet for Catherine's mom. Time is passing. The wedding is just a couples away. My next endocrinologist and lab appointment will be after the publishing of the convocation for the master studies. Lots of masters and doctors I've seen this last years. They were students like me. I'm successful, I am capable. I should get it. I remembered most of the things we reviewed in the course.

Even if I don't get in, I'll look for another program in the capital. I can't stay here... No

I must not think about failing, I haven't even tried. I should get prepared. I should study.

I sent the text message to my aunt about the name of the puppy. I don't know if she received it or not. I hope she did. I hope she keeps it and we can pick it up. I hope the little dog can get to know me and I will be able to care for her.
