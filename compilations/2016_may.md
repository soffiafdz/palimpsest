### 2016-05-01

I've finished making the spreadsheet for the ISRA test. I love doing this kind of things. I should had studied Computer Science or Software Developing. I mean, I love that this calculations offer me the information I need to actually make a diagnosis of the psychological profile of a subject.

My dad brought breakfast today. I did the exercise in the morning, although it was just warm up. I showered. I weighted one or two pounds less than yesterday. I had just went to the bathroom and had finished the morning activities.

What else can I write about? Catherine went to the United States and bought us two t-shirts. Chevo and Jessica posted something in the conversation of the seven of us. They wanted to invite us to go tomorrow to the movies and see the new captain america film. Catherine answered them first. We already have plans with Anahi and my brother.

He was sitting here in my room with the lights out. I was lying in the couch watching tv and saw when he went out of sight and never appeared in the hole of the wall that shows the stairs. After a while I stood and check. He was in this chair watching something in his ipad. I freaked out. I know he was not snooping around or even seeing the computer, but I snapped. "What are you doing in my room?" I asked him firmly. He smiled thinking I was just joking around because of how I don't like him sitting in the chair. After noting my voice and my face, his smile faded and he just apologized and went upstairs. Did I do something wrong?

I sometimes go to his room but never when he's not there. I don't snoop in his stuff. I sometimes go when he's not there. I am an hypocrite. My secrets are not more important than his. I wasn't thinking about this. I was just angry of people being in here.

Tomorrow I'll go to Catherine's home, maybe we'll meet Anahi there. Catherine hasn't seen the last episode of How I Met your Mother. We made her promise us we would all see it together.

We can see the first episode of the other season of Misfits. There is now ready the last episode of Game of Thrones. We will see it together.

There are other things I could write about, but, I think I feel a little down.

Yesterday I researched a little about the dosage. I found the endocrine guidelines for treatment, now I have evidence that my doses are really low. It's just the first 8 weeks. I'm not even by a fourth of that timeframe. I could just be patient and wait.

I'd be lying if I said the changes don't scare me.

A part of me wants to experiment them now, see them, feel my body different and see how my face changes little by little, being unrecognized by the people who're supposed to know me. I want to see Chevo and Jessica and look at their faces when they see me differently.

Is that why their usage of my name makes me uncomfortable? Am I really expecting of never mentioning it to my parents until people can't really see me as a man anymore?

In a month, no, the last days of this one, I will go to Mexicali and travel to Jalisco. My parents might go, too. I don't have to say anything until then. I'll still be Ivan, their son, their honored graduate.

Hilda and Anna will see me as how I am. Just a couple more weeks of low doses of hormones and another sessions of laser. That will be the only differences between me as of right now and future me.

I could ask my mother for the money of therapy. I have to put gas tomorrow. I'll drive tomorrow and Wednesday. I should buy the pills. The antidepressants. I could wait to buy the "anti-baby" pills as Johanna called them. I won't get pregnant, and besides, The endocrinologist did recommend me to leave a four day window of rest.

I feel a tingling ache in my testicle. Is it the anti-androgens making its thing?

I finished with the ISRA test. A couple more questionnaires and I'm done. I have to transcript the NEO one. I could finish with the translation and do a google form. Would I need permission to actually make the standarization?

I could ask Chevo for help. I could do it all by myself. It's just a side work. I won't make any money. I could contact the spanish doctor and tell him my plan of adapting it to the Mexico population. I won't lose anything by asking.

I could keep procrastinating. That is always an option.

### 2016-05-02

Honestly, I don't feel like writing. It's been more than 180 continuing days that I've finished this thing of writing my thoughts unedited, just let out what I feel and think for a couple of minutes in semi-coherent sentences that I probably won't read again.

Why? Experts claim that an habit needs at least 21 days for it to be conformed. I haven't been doing exercise for more than 21 days. There was one day that I skipped. I still wrestle with the idea of just skipping it today, stay in bed, sleep a little more.

I can hear Luis talking about his results of the RAVEN test I gave him. Why does it bother me? Sure, he might be smarter than me when I was his age, so what? He might end up being smarter than me when he gets to my age. Miguel is studying an engineering major, he studied a technical speciality in high school, and yet he did exams, I skipped all of them. I graduated as the 12th of my generation.

From undergrad I finished as first of my generation. I have a medal for it and a diploma. I sat in the table of vip and shook hands with the other winners. I gave a speech. I will travel to another state to receive a medal for the score I had in my professional test.

Should I be proud? Do I feel threatened by the idea that Luis could be smarter than me?

The day after tomorrow I'll pick him up from school. We'll meet with Catherine in River Plaza and later with Anahi to watch the movie. I'll drive to his school after my session with Rene. My mother will give notice to his school that "his brother" will pick him up.

They don't know me anymore. His is not the same school that I attended to, not anymore.

There are a lot of movies that I haven't seen yet. There are a lot of books that I haven't read. I still haven't learned calculus or programming.

Did I give up? Will I give up the exercise, too?

I remember when I weighted myself almost every day. Is this nervousness about getting over the scale and seeing a bigger number than the one from the day before. I do my exercise, I try to control what I eat, but what if it isn't enough?

Today I showered and shaved. I shaved my whole body. There are red dots on my thighs that have not closed still. One on the left one stayed open and dripping until well after I had finished with my face. There lies a big red mark on the yellow towel which I used to dry myself with.

I ate breakfast, I scrambled two eggs with the sauce that my mother left from yesterday. With that and a glass of water I took my pills. Those pills. How ironic that a little more than nothing feels more useless than waiting to start. I am taking one pill each, a fourth, of what I should be taking is still more than nothing. Why does it feel so vain?

I started treatment, I am doing something. The lady from the gas station welcomed me as a woman. Why does it still feel fake and undeserving? Maybe I will always feel this way. Maybe I'll stay like this until I start seeing myself differently.

Yesterday I read some chapters of the book. I don't think I'll finish it soon, but I still read more than what I had the last month.

In 8 weeks I have the next appointment with the endocrinologist. I read how one patient started with 25 mg of spiro for a month. I'll just be 4 weeks longer. I have the paper, I have the evidence to ask for a higher dose. I don't even know the effects the medication has had on me.

In 8 weeks I'll have finished the program that my app gave me for losing weight. Will the dr weight me again, too? Will he check my body like that time? Will he ask about my breasts again? Are they even breasts?

In two weeks, no, less than that. In ten days I will have my next laser session. I hope it hurts. I hope it's more effective than last.

Should I tell the woman the medication I am taking? What if she says something or asks more questions?

My mother knows about them, but I don't know about my dad.

Should I tell Luis? It's idiotic to think about waiting until he asks.

Will I tell him?

### 2016-05-03

It was hard to get up form bed. Again I slipped my hand into my trousers, inside my pants and grabbed, touched, explored. I though I would have to reinitiate the counter on my app where I crudely tagged it "Days since I cum". The number is still the same.

I ate the biscuit breakfast and took the pills. Those little candies that its function is make me smile. Some kill my tears and fears, others destroy the manliness that poisons my body and the other one changes me from the inside. 5 little pills.

Thursday will be 12 of May, a little more than a week. That day I'll have the second session. I remember typing this exact words: "I hope it hurts".

That day Luis will have his recital or festival or something. My mother asked me if I wanted to come. Sure, I told her. That day will be Thursday. This week I'll have the penultimate session of testing with the patient. But even if for some reason I could finish this Thursday, the next one would be for results.

It's weird. I was afraid of being alone. Having no friends or supporting people. All of my group of friends know everything about me. Ok, maybe not the hormones, but everything else. The use the name and the pronouns. It's even with Catherine or where they're not actually required to.

Why do I keep wishing that they weren't here? Why do I still want to be alone? I don't want anybody to know I am trans. I don't want them to see me and see a quimera, nor a metamorphosis. I want to be me. I want to be seen as me.

But who really am I? Am I Ivan or Sofia? I don't want to be referred by the male name and forms. Why does it is still uncomfortable to give the Sofia's prescription? Or entering to the lab?

Why is it impossible to tell my parents about my name and persona?

Tomorrow I'll pick Luis from school. I'll walk to therapy as usual and pick him up from there. Everything else will be different. We'll drive to River plaza and meet with Catherine, maybe Anahi will meet us there, too.

What will happen in his school? My mother already gave notice that his big brother would pick him up. How will I dress?

I know exactly what I will wear. What I don't and can't know is how will I look.

Will I clear my face? Will I retouch it? Will there be somebody to recognize me? Will Luis say something?

Today was the burial of Eneyda, the medicine student who was missing and then found dead. I had known about her, seen the posts and news. I knew how she studied in the faculty. What I ignored was how she was Fernando's girlfriend. He's mourning. Anahi saw him in the funeral. She told us how she was expecting to see him crying, or devastated. He was just, there. missing, with the empty sight of a broken man. He was empty.

I can't even imagine how it would be the experience Catherine's lost.

I can write and wonder how it would be to be alone or isolated and forgotten. But even then, it's like I take Catherine as granted. Of course she would be by my side if I went to a hidden place of the world where nobody knows my story.

What if it were the other way around? What would be if everyone stayed but her?

If I had known about the app months ago, the first used I would had thunk about using it for would be counting the days since my last reaching out to Monica.

Lately, I really didn't know since when had I thunk about her or her face?

It came as a surprise when Catherine mentioned her. Yesterday instagram offered her one of her pictures and her accouns as being similar to her tastes. Today, the same photo appeared on her screen. She told me how she had seen this girl with Monica. At first I thought the coincidence was that the account that instagram offered her was of this woman with her picture with Monica.

The account was Monica. I didn't care. I didn't want to know. There was no surprise or interest. She kept on and I realized it was not apathy but worry what ill-ed me.

"Show me the picture' I thought of asking.

She kept talking about it and just send it anyway. She wanted to show the text that the app gave her. But I could see the silhouettes of the two women in dresses. A normal curvy body wrapped in a light striped gray dress, and a slimmer firm one with a black dress and the hint of red strappy shoes.

I recognized the body and hated it and missed it and envied it.

There was no face, just a body.

Later in the day I looked for the picture and met her face. Her smiling, mocking face.

Does she think of me, does she hate me?

Will I stop some day remembering her?

### 2016-05-04

I'm home. My phone was dead. As I grabbed it from my purse, I could see a red light flashing on the microphone. It vibrated a couple of times through the bag. Luis was seating by my right and Catherine by my left.

"Do I call her Sofia?" "No...?" "But, calling her Ivan will upset her"

I do hate being in this situation.

I woke up and drove to pick Luis up from school like three or for times before leaving my bed. Today I got up earlier than usual. Several times did I awoke and return to slumber before deciding to start the day. By 8 o clock I was already doing the morning exercises. Abs. Something about crossing the legs or hips and 40 seconds of planking. As I weighted myself I didn't realize I had actually gained a pound instead of losing it.

I shaved and put clothes on. I wore the shirt that Catherine bought for us. I decided to wear the long black sweater. I applied make up even though I would be picking Luis up. There was a kid there, reading a book, when I entered the office. Rosa welcomed me and congratulate me about my graduation and being now a psych licenciate. The boy asked me why was I picking Luis up if he leaves in the afternoon. He started chatting about the book he was reading. Frankenstein from Mary Shelly, I read that book when I was in fifth grade I guess. It was one of the first books in english that I read. I don't remember most of the story.

I picked Luis up and listened to him, what he had to say. He was confused why it was talking about Victor Frankenstein and he was telling the story but in the cover it said Mary Shelly. I explained to him how it was a story written by Mary and Victor was the protagonist. He seemed to understand my point a little.

I drove towards the plaza with Luis. I told Rene I would be taking him to the movies. We talked a little about last week. The card of the pharmacy and the problems I might face in the future. Eneyda, the student who was murdered. A med student from the faculty, the girlfriend of Fernando, Anahi's friend. It stuns you, when things happen closer than you might expect.

Catherine was with Andrea when we arrived. I introduced them as we walked. We went to the food garden, and after giving a round seeing the different locals, Luis and I decided to order two bowls of ramen. It was the newest place there and the first one we visited. "Welcome (girls)," the cashier received Catherine and me, with Luis behind me. Did he hear?

"What happens when you have both high levels of hormones in your body, male and female ones?"

I explained to him a little how testosterone is stronger and would overcome the estrogen. Does he know something? Is it because of me or him?

Should I let my pills out on the open for him to see? Should I just come to him and open up?

I reapplied my make up before picking him up.

And just like therapy, I don't know what else I can say. There were some messages planning a meeting, a going out with the gang. Paolas, chevica and us. I am a little excited about going, seeing them. How would they look at me? Could I go like me?

Catherine took the screenshot of the picture I sent her. I saw the video she took of me as I was eating soup. I could see me, my face, my eyes, my hair. I heard my voice. What is it? It's low, not really manly, but not feminine either. It is a male voice, unmistakeable. Can I change it, modulate it?

I wouldn't use female pronouns besides Luis, would I raise my voice?

I stood beside him with a bra and make up and a long sweater. Some feminine nouns slipped Catherine's mouth. I'm sure Luis heard them as he heard the ramen cashier.

Maybe this weekend we will go to Mexicali. I could go, I don't mind. When my mother asked us, I didn't tell her I had plans for this saturday. They asked about Sunday. We could go just that day.

I would not enter the pool. I would not take my shirt off.

Would I show them my pills? Would anyone ask? Would I answer?



### 2016-05-05

Another day of applying tests. I'm done with the tedious part of giving questionnaires and waiting. Next week I'll attend the session about the results.

Catherine talked with her mother. She was asked about me. They talked about Eneyda, the student that was killed. And so came the subject. The students of psychology are the ones who take psychotherapy, not the med ones.

"And talking about therapy... how is Ivan?"

And how am I indeed. I am fine, now. Catherine used the opportunity to bring her mother up to the latest news. Both of my parents know, I will "make the change", our relationship is serious, she is scared of what her dad could think or say, and that's the reason why she is not really able to visualize a future with me. Even if I change, she'll stay by my side.

I read the questions. I did not hear her voice or inflection or could see her eyes as she laid them in the air. Even then I felt, uh, rejection.

She doesn't really accept the relationship. Once again, people wish she could be with somebody else. Am I damaged goods?

She told me how she feels about her mother's illness. She's been sick lately, vomit and nausea and high blood pressure and how it is stress and stuff... Is it us? our relationship what's making her feel this way?

She wants grandchildren and talk about her daughter and her life and a big wedding... and with me, those things won't happen. I am the one who's taking that from her hands.

"She doesn't want them for me, she wants those for herself"

This day I finished the format of the questionnaire and I'm glad I did. I calculated a 45 minutes of answering each of them. He made the first one in 25 minutes. His score is lower than Luis. The second one he finished it before the hour came up. Liliana told me how she's thinking about sending me another evaluation.

And my mother now told me about the reaction of her friend, my godmother, Theresa. She saw the video of my speech, how I talked and congratulated them. She cried of the excitement.

Can I take those accomplishments as mine? Are they still my own if I go by another name or face?

How could I brag my diplomas and medals when they were awarded to another person? Will everyone still congratulate me when they won't recognize me anymore? Will they still remember about what I have accomplished when they don't care about me?

I weighted myself in the morning and returned to the number of two days ago. I fried the meat of one taco with two eggs. The plate lasted me almost half of a show. I used to finished it before the first commercial break would even start.

I waited until the afternoon before eating again. One burrito and the chicken Miguel left yesterday.

I dreamed something about someone taking out my clothes from the drying machine. It was loaded with my underwear and pajama bottoms. A couple of shorts and a couple of pants, besides that they were just colorful panties and three bras. Months ago I wouldn't even had let them in the machine. I remembered them before falling asleep, I just didn't care.

In my dream there was a conversation, doubt and shock. And I just didn't care. I heard it and I could explain it, and felt this feeling inside of me of being relieved. I rested with the comfort of a lightness.

I woke up and went to pick them up. They were in a cardboard box in front of the machine. The clothes were Miguel's. He was the one who took them out and laid them in there. He absolutely knows something by now. Does he care? Will he mention it?

Do I care?

I received a call today from the laser place. They will have this promotion, I assume for the mother's day, that they will offer every service by half of it's price. I could pay two sessions, just pay the one of next week and another one and receive four.

I have from tomorrow until Tuesday.

In the weekend we will go to Mexicali. Saturday I might see the gang. They talked about going somewhere fun and where they'd serve food, too. Someone proposed Pockets. I feel a little excited. What can I wear? How will I present myself?

Now that they know, there is this pressure of using it, not wasting their knowledge and acceptance. Like if I should force myself to show me.

Just like going to the endo, or taking my blood as Sofia.

Do they really see me like that?

Or are we all just kidding myself?

### 2016-05-06

I have already finished grading the Raven test. It was annoying looking again for a norm. It was the opposite this time. With Luis I wanted to give him a lower score so he wouldn't brag later of his abnormal intelligence. With my patient, even yesterday that I gave the test to him, I was surprised with the time he finished. He was done in less than a half an hour. Luis lasted almost the hour. The patient, even with two years more of age than Luis, got a score of 7 points below. His discordance points, both of them, were in the correct range. He barely got into the 50th percentile. He's barely average.

I have the raw score of the IPIP NEO 300. The complete 300 answers to the items are recorded in 10 sheets of paper. I could just transcript the numbers to the excel tables and get the raw scores of each facet and subscale.

But those numbers don't say much if I don't compare them with something else, with a sampling, with the rest of people. And like the rest of the tests I got into research mode and looked everywhere for a table of norms. There is none anywhere. Even the page where I looked for the Scales says how they don't recommend analyzing a single test. There should be a sample and an analysis of a group, with each member contrasted with the rest of that sample.

So, I'm screwed. I could trust the raw data of other researchers. I finally found the answers of more than 300 thousand people. The only problem is the data is raw. It's a piece of text with all the answers separated by spaces. How could I analyze that? It's moments like these that make me think that I haven't learned enough. That I don't know enough.

Yesterday my mother told me how her psych friend reassured her that she lasted two years to be accepted in a job because of the lack of experience. After hearing how the psychologists refers patients for me to be evaluated, she told her that that is awesome and enough. It's perfect for declaring experience.

Why don't I feel comforted, then?

Tomorrow I'll go out. I'll shave and change clothes. We will be meeting near the River zone an hour after noon.

Catherine told how she would be arriving later. Her mother finishes her english class by one and she has to do her cleaning and change of bandages.

Do I prefer leaving by myself and getting there on time? Or wait for Catherine and arrive with her?

It still makes me feel nervous exiting the house dressed in a feminine way. Walking alone and face strangers. Speak and be heard. The contrast of my voice and presentation.

Her mother has seen changes. Luis keeps asking about gender and transexual people and hormones. Miguel took my underwear out of the drying machine.

It's been two weeks of hormones. A low dose but two weeks.

This weekend I have to change money, buy dollars so I can go and pay the laser sessions. Next thursday I'll go for the second one.

In three weeks I have to be in Mexicali and ready to board a plane. Get my clothes to the cleaning place. Buy the medicine.

I can give a lot of use to the new app I downloaded that gives me points in an rpg way for the things that I have to do.

All the tests, all but one, are interpreted and ready. There is just the integration and redaction of the report. Liliana will give my phone number to the next patient to be evaluated, a teacher. Woman, adult.

I'm more comfortable with adult people. I don't feel like I have to take care of them. I don't feel like I have to hide information or juggle the confidentiality.

What I find I tell her. I'm paid by her. The results are to her.

Another person that will meet me as the Psychologist Ivan.

"The diploma will say Licensed Psychologist Jose Ivan Fernandez"

That's who I will be. Who I was supposed to be. How will I pick the diploma a year from now with my id? What will they tell me? It's still a year. I have lots of things to worry before that. 10 months. 8 months by a bigger dosage of hormones. Maybe I will still be able to look like Ivan. Even for a couple of minutes.

Do I hope for it or not?

### 2016-05-07

I haven't filled the agenda. It lies there, unopened with the answered tests of my patient over it. Today I left the house, I wore the same clothes I always use, but presented in a completely different way. I didn't wear a bright red lipstick or an intense eyeliner. I didn't wear a really feminine blouse or filled my bra with anything.

I just wore what I liked and touched up my face. My hair is mine, natural, nothing but conditioner and mousse on it. Cheap foundation and a mascara from target. That was it. That was all I wore.

My parents went to Costco in the morning after my dad left the bathroom and I got in. I didn't eat breakfast and took my pills anyway. In the morning I did the exercises, they were focused on the arms. Yesterday I didn't overeat. In Pockets I realized hoy it's more conscious now the intention of eating slower. It helps with the appetite and lower to food I intake.

I weighted myself after shitting in the bathroom from downstairs. I weight 175 pounds, one less than yesterday. 5 less than when I started weighting myself. There is progress. As I looked at myself in the mirror of the bathroom before entering the shower I realized how I am changing.

There was no conditioner bottle so I turned the water valves, wrapped myself in the towel and called my dad for another bottle. He gave it to me and I returned to what I was doing.

Catherine was waiting for her parents to arrive. Whenever they did, I could leave my house and go pick her up. Her mother would just clean her bandages and she'd be ready. We were the ones supposed to get there late, but were the first ones.

Paola was the next one to arrive. We chatted through the windows of the cars. Like 20 minutes later Chevo and Jessica came to the parking lot. They had to return home because they forgot something. After meeting, they'd go to a concert of Sin Bandera.

How did I look? That was in my head. The waiter kept calling Chevo "joven". Later he would give him the check. We played and took pictures. It was fun.

After playing pool while we waited for the food, we decided to go outside and wait in the patio.

Jessica invited us for her birthday to go somewhere and do something. Both Catherine and I thought about a night outside, a couple of bars, some drinks. It sounded nice. Then she completed herself. "Maybe breakfast? something nice"

She wanted to go to this place. "It was my idea", interrupted her Chevo jokingly.

"Princess tea party restaurant" I remember that place. Next saturday. I saw pictures of people in there. Pink wallpapers, everything fancy and nice. We would go there and eat breakfast. How would they see me? How would I look there? I remember seeing the pictures and hating the place. All the gender expectations and reinforcements.

I wouldn't be there as a man. Why am I still uncomfortable?

It will be two days after my laser session. The next day, friday, I won't be able to shave. The hairs are thicker and blacker. When I shave the next day, would they still be noticeable?

I am a little nervous, a little stressed.

After we all leave the place and said our good-byes, I invited Catherine to a cup of coffee. We drank tea in the Dinastia 12. It was nice. We were welcomed in the feminine way when we entered. As we sat, the waitress looked at us and asked us if we were ready in the feminine way, too.

It was a contrast of being in Pockets with people who know me. Waiters who don't and strangers who look at me with evaluating and suspecting eyes.

"La graduacion de ellos, invitarlos a mi casa, juntos"

All the plurals were in the masculine, neutral. The singular ones were omitted or avoided. A couple of times, one by Chevo and the last one, by Jessica when she told us to go pretties to the tea place.

There is the house of tea that I haven't took Catherine there yet.

Outside Catherine's house, we kept our conversations. We finished with how we would live together in the capital. Her mother asked her about me, our relationship. The wedding, would she confess? Am I one of her sins?

Are we ready to live together?

She's a little nervous and I am very excited.

### 2016-05-08

Two days before my father's birthday and mother's day.

I have placed almost all the pills for next week. Today I woke up before my father arrived from his morning trip.

I was younger. It was before highschool. How is it that I used to write this...

I am not her, I am not 22. I haven't entered high school yet. I am 15 years old. There is this girl I like, she's my closest friend but I have mixed feelings about her. There is a connection that's not really physical. I like being with her and close with her. I don't really feel the urge to hug her or feel her or kiss her. I haven't kissed anyone ever.

She asked me to be one of her "chambelanes". I've always hated this mexican tradition of the 15th brithday party of girls. It's not envy. They make me uncomfortable, it's facing the fact that they're different. She invited to be on hers and I feel special because of it. I am important enough to share this moment. I'm here in her gym for the essays of her dance. I've met her father. "don't you think it's normal that the man of the family has some time for himself?, doesn't your dad goes sometimes somewhere himself, like fishing or something"

Even those questions, it wasn't about me and yet it was so foreign.

Why am I writing about that moment? There are a lot other things I could be thinking about. Even then, the party, wearing the suit and getting uncomfortable, leaving early, taking it off. I played a character earlier that same day and I played another one, both with Zuri's friends, with my own, in the dance floor. I was extremely tired.

I did the exercise, weighted myself, took the pills and ate.

I watched the game of thrones episode without Catherine. There was the fight outside Tower of Joy. Rickon was given to Ramsey. Jon has left his watch.

Tomorrow I'll go pay the next sessions of laser and I'll buy both the cypro and the spiro, even though I won't take them until next week. How will the effects of its absence bother me? I've been complaining and whining about the low dose. If it's so low, not taking them wouldn't have to take a huge effect on me.

Tomorrow is 9. In three weeks exactly I'll be going to Mexicali, flying.

The first time I boarded a plane was before Miguel was born. My grandmother was sick and I traveled to Mexico City. I had faint memories about walking and climbing huge heads. I'm in this kind of park like disneyland but different. I pose in this huge board with ta cowboy riding a horse painted in the front, there is this hole on the wood where my face can appear over the cowboy's body. I ride this game where I drive an excavating machine. I'm fours year old, three maybe. How can I remember this? It was almost 20 years ago. Like another different life.

I was a boy then.

"Excuse me, are you a boy or a girl?" "... a boy" "see? I told you" Were they teasing me? How could they not know?

Then, a couple years later I would travel to Jalisco for vacations. I was in second grade. Miguel was just a baby, and I was a little kid. For years I would have this urges to fly again, somewhere, anywhere. I wanted to travel, go through the airport, board the plane, fly...

I am in the university, it's a little after my birthday and I'm doing all the paperwork to fulfill my dream. In my head I am battling my own war. I travel alone. Four flights. First to Jalisco, again, and then Monterrey. The same way back. After years I board four different airplanes in a weekend's length.

I would fear it was all for naught even until the day before I actually left. It was a transatlantic flight. I took an american airplane and went through an american airport all by myself. From California to London. Then Madrid.

I flight another time before returning. From Madrid to Brussels. A lot of bus and train travels I've done, too.

Even after traveling around Spain and meeting the world, I traveled again with Catherine to Jalisco one more time. One week there. Those were some of the happiest days I've ever had. I had the opportunity to compare traveling by myself with traveling along someone I love.

While I be alone in this month's travel, too?

Will I travel again next year to Mexico city again? Will I be alone or along my loved one?

### 2016-05-09

For the first time I'll write here in my phone. There has been more than a handful of times that I published my words from here. But it's always about an emergency, maybe I'm in mexicali,or I'm in Disneyland and there is no Internet. How did I do it when we went to Universal studios?

Those times I just copy and paste. This, now that there is no Internet home and won't be until tomorrow, is the first time that I've actually tried to write them in a different keyboard.

Today I went to pay for the laser session. The lady in the spa recognized me. Maybe I'm young, maybe she doesn't get much male clientele.

First I changed 600 pesos to dollars. I paid one hundred for four sessions. I'm set until September. Four months counting this one.

I went to the pharmacy and they welcomed me with a "young man" they said nothing about the discrepancy between the names in the prescriptions. I bought both the antidepressants, spironolactone and the antibaby pills.

From there I went to Catherine's.

We talked and watched the episode of game of thrones. Her mother made chicken in Chipotle sauce. I was supposed to like it. It should had been delicious, except it wasn't. There was a heavy taste of cream in it. I just ate the chicken and the rice.

What could I wear for Saturday's. Jessica's breakfast will be in a fancy and feminine restaurant. At first, I was apathetic to the idea. But now...

I don't really want to go with pants and shirt. I don't want to be there as a man. I am not one. On the other hand I can't be as feminine as them. I'd just feel as a caricature. Somebody hidden in a disguise.

I thought about asking her to borrow her some clothes. Maybe a blouse, something simple. I don't have shoes but our sizes are similar. Her feet are a little shorter than mine.

As we talked she told me something: you need to buy a lot more things to pass as a girl.

It broke me. I just paid more than 2 thousand pesos, today in matters related to passing. These months the medication is just a formality, they're doing nothing yet. The first laser session was a beggining. I'm thousand more behind seeing real results. And the, I need to pay more.

She didn't realize then the effect those words had on me. She sent a message to the group asking for how they would dress. Was it formal? Was it like those places were they don't allow you to enter with the wrong kind of shoes?

I read their answers and felt worse. Going pretty, like princesses. Paola send pictures of women dressed in different outfits.

I read them and felt foreign. There was no envy or longing. I just, didn't sympathize. Am I different?

I'm not like them, I'm not like Chevo either. Who, what am I?

I felt this sickening feeling in my gut. I wanted to go home, hide in my sheets and just cry.

I felt sad, so sad it hurt. I wanted to swallow it and keep it then until tonight. Catherine saw me and asked me if I was fine. I tried to lie but couldn't. My eyes betrayed me. I just let it out and hugged her. I cried in her shoulder and she held me.

It came to me as a surprise. Am I this emotional now? Are this because of the hormones? How many days have I taken them?

I'm a couple of days before beginning the rest. Four days of not taking them.

Eighteen days. A little short of three weeks. Do I have changes yet? I thought about restarting the streak when I would begin. I could use this words as a daily log of changes and new feelings. It could be a place to see the discoveries of my new body, my new self.

I didn't. I just kept on.

I like it better this way. I don't want to be defined by them. I don't want to just think about them and counting one and every day. When I wanted to know how many days have passed and I couldn't I felt relieved.

What can I do? I came to the conclusion of not going. Teling Jessica that it was too much for me. Being in a place where there would be such a focus on feminity would made me feel dysphoric. Like I don't belong. I would not feel like a man nor a woman. I would be sad and distracted and as much as I want to share the moment with you, being there, besides not really being able to accompany you, I would make things worse for everybody.

But is that what I really want? Just avoiding it and not going because I'm not woman enough?



### 2016-05-10

 I might have to cheat again. I'm on my mother's phone. I dont think I have the time to type the seven hundred words now, in here.

There is still no internet. Today we went to fridays to celebrate my fathers birthday and mothers day. My mom stayed home all day. I tried to do the report but I still havent started it. I finished with the family test. I just have one more day to finish it.

Tomorrow ill go to therapy. In the evening ill see catherine after my session. I still feel sad. Its not just the saturdays breakfast place. Its not just that i have nothing to wear. Its the feeling of being an impostor, being fake, a failure.

My mother went to pick my grandma from the bus central before picking Luis up from school. Will she see me tomorrow when ill leave?

Jessica sent a message saying that shell change the place for the weekend. There was a problem today with the reservation. My problem is supposed to be solved. And yet i still feel like shit. Evertything has changed and et nothing has.

I cant keep typing on this fucking phone. I really tried. Its useless.

Fuck this. Fuck this. Fuck this...
Even cheating in this ducking phone is pissing me off.
Fucking autocorrector doesnt change i, but it does change fucking.
Fuck this.


### 2016-05-11

So close, so fucking close.

Today, after three days I got the internet back. Yesterday I really tried to finish the words from my mother's phone, I kept writing even though I was irritated and sad and wanted to do nothing. It was all for naught. one hundred and more than ninety days all gone to shit. It was the longest streak I've ever had and more than I could ever imagine.

"Do you want me to help you cheat?" she asked me. If I had told her yes. If only I could had answered her yes.

It's over. It's fine. This will be a new beginning. I have 21 days of hormones, three weeks and I'll start from zer0 here again. I'll be a shitty egg until 100 days from now that I get back the phoenix medal.

Three weeks. How many weeks until I get to female range hormone levels? Will I start over again from there?

My breasts are bigger. It might be the hormones or it might be the exercise. But I can see a difference. I dreamed something about clothes. I had thunk about wearing the black skirt with the white blouse. I've never worn the red tights I bought before the night of the movies. Today we could give a round to the shoe places in the Plaza. Maybe I could find a pair of flats there. I decided not to go.

My grandmother came yesterday, my mom picked her up from the bus station. She slept here with Luis and was up in the morning talking with my mom before she left for school. I was awake listening to their voices and screams. I wanted to go back to sleep, I was tired and angry.

I slept a couple hours more. I had time enough to shave and get ready. I decided to wear the jeans Catherine gave me and the red shirt with squares, it was a neutral attire. Nothing too masculine, but not too feminine either. I applied make up and mousse on my hair. I was ready to leave and pick Catherine up. My grandmother wasn't in the lower plant. She didn't see me.

"I can't see myself opening up to her. I was her first grandson"

I put gasoline and was dispatched by a man. He said hi normally, and then referred to me as boss. He saw me as a man. I thought that was how I looked. Sure, I could be a man another day.

I picked Catherine up from her house, her lips were a pinkly dark red. She was wearing a white t-shirt of wonderwoman. "Are you ok, you look serious?"

I was sad and down and blue.

"Ironically isn't it that you are like a princess?" said Rene after session. I am bothered by the idea of jessica's choice of restaurant, the femininity taken to the extreme. "A place for girls to feel like the princesses they are and their loved ones to treat them that way". Isn't that what I secretly want? For my family to accept it and see me and treat me as a woman?

Is not that why I can't even imagine it? Because if I think about it, I'll want it. If I know it's possible, I'll be devastated when it never comes true.

The internet finally came back and I lost my streak. I had asked her how I looked. Was it before or after the session? Kind of... in the middle, neither her nor there.

She told me how she relates me wearing shirts with being a man, maybe it's that association that makes her see me this way. Although, when I exited from Rene, I did look like a girl.

"Girls, I want to give you a good service but it was full downstairs and I'm alone"

We weren't sure if we heard her correctly. Did she call us girls? Did she see me as a woman?

Later she would say it again and we confirmed it. I did look feminine. We talked a lot about different things. I smoked like I hadn't in a long time. I'm supposed not to. I made the new timer in my phone.

I cried a little when we continued the conversation about birthdays outside her house. The time after our trips. December, January. She was supposed to get her distance from me. I invited her out. She took me out for my birthday.

"I get sad... I already was Sofi but I pretended to be Ivan, and I almost lost myself and I almost lost you"

The man who sold bread called me a girl, too, when I waited to be attended in the tire shop for the tire that wasn't really a flat.

Tomorrow I'll have my second laser session, and my second picking up of Luis and my second giving of results.

I, again, haven't finished the report for tomorrow.

### 2016-05-12

I'm a little tired. My face is neither swollen nor sore. I'm fine. I gave my second patient his results. I could see his reaction of how it was on -point. Even outside school after graduation, I feel lost without a guide. I can't give therapy.

Today I ate breakfast, I finished the chicken salad from Costco, first as a sandwich and then the rest with some crackers. That was my food of the day. That's what I ate before and after picking up Luis.

I want to go to bed and lie there. It looks so cozy and comfortable.

Luis would get out 30 minutes after noon. My appointment was at noon. I left home a quarter of an hour before. Maybe 20 minutes. I got there earlier and rang the bell. She welcomed me and I came in. She gave me the pages to sign and we came in. It hurt again, it was just like last time. The number was lower than before, does it mean that the settings were lower? It did hurt the same places. My lower neck was almost painless. Every prick or burn was both painful and exquisite. I could feel the effect. She told me how I would see patches of hairs not coming back, that would be the effects coming. I already saw some of that. I don't have to worry about beard shadow anymore.

Now the only thing bringing me back is my own voice. What's the point of looking like a woman if I can't speak?

I exited like five minutes after noon. It was the perfect time, I got to Luis' school just in time. The girl who was naming them on the mic didn't know me. She came closer to the car expecting a name. I gave it to her, full name. She didn't need it. Luis from 6th grade. That was all she said.

No, that wasn't.

"Luis of 6th, Sofia"

Those were her words.

"How would I be called if I were a girl?... How would you had named me?"

Catherine is right, I asked that same question. Except it wasn't. What changed? Why did it make me so uncomfortable? I was lying on the couch listening to the television when he opened his mouth. Was it the answers? Or their non caring? Is it that I'm scared Luis is exactly like me? So what if he is? What would it change? Why am I feeling like crying just now?

I know it's not my fault and it's not my parents.

I am trans. I wore a dress yesterday and took a picture to show it to Catherine. Miguel has a pillowcase filled with panties in his sock drawer. Luis told everyone how it would be cool if he were a girl.

I remember a chat Eric had with my grandma. He had some of his first seizures in this house. Even before that, he had some episodes, too. He got lost once when we were playing monopoly. He hid under the table. We could not find him. He stayed with my grandma and they were talking in the dinner room. Why did I listen? Why do I still remember?

"Remember how you told me you wanted to die, and you thought you would have been happier were you born a girl"

Did that conversation really happen?

Today is 12th of may. A little more than two weeks and I'll be boarding a plane again. Why ain't I excited? Was it the company that thrilled me? It's not the same if nobody who really knows me goes with me.

I was supposed to take Luis and my grandma to the university. Liliana sent me a text message a little after three. She had an urgent evaluation that she could give to me, I just needed to go earlier. It was impossible.

It was totally possible. I didn't even need to drive them. My mother got here just in time.

I could offer Hiram's parents my service as an academic supporter. Give him some assistance in his classes, tutorship. They could talk about it. I have a visa. Even I could just go there a couple days a week.

It sounded so... distant and scary. I couldn't. Not because I'm not able, or even because they would take my visa from me. I can't because I'll change. He will start the next grade after summer. I'll look totally different in August. Will I? Will I really?

Today was my first day without hormones. Three more days. Just three more.

I feel so tired.

### 2016-05-13

I feel down. There is this heavy sadness that surrounds me and embraces me. I feel so little and fragile and weak. Every single blow of wind can break me. This is the second day with just three pills. Can that be a real reason for this? Maybe this is all in my head, too. I told Catherine how I woke up really late and unrested. O feel drowsy and tired. Could I send the dr a message? He told me that I could and should text him with any symptom that presented as an effect of the medication.

Does this count?

It's a real low dose. I'm barely taking something away from my body.

I did just half of the exercise of today. It was supposed to be a morning routine and yet I skipped it completely when I got up. I ate breakfast. I didn't went to the bathroom nor weighted myself.

Catherine was. She went to the doctor in the morning. She is heavier than before.

My phone just moved with the muted dance of its vibrations of a new message. I know it's Catherine. The last message was almost an hour ago. We were talking about tomorrow, clothes. That could be another reason of my depressed mood.

I took the clothes out of the drying machine and laid it in my bed in the afternoon.

When was it that I watched the Sicario movie? Yesterday? the day before? I've put the Wolf of wallstreet like three time today. It's a movie that I've actually watched before, although incompletely. I watched it with Raul in our living room, in his laptop. His little netbook. Was it in spanish?

What can I wear tomorrow? My dad was in the kitchen as I was texting Catherine. Go to him or not? Asking him? I could tell him that I'll go out tomorrow and to move the cars. He'd ask me the time of my departure. That I don't know, not yet.

I decided against it. I want to go but not at the same time. What is it that I avoid? I told Catherine that I wanted to wear leggings but I don't have something to wear on top. My white blouse don't go with them as it is too short.

"Wear jeans". That's it, I don't want to. Why don't I? Because I wear them every fucking day. Those are my everyday clothes. I am seen as a man with them. They're woman's. I am not actually seen as a man with them. The last time I wore them, when I went out with her, everyone gendered me female. Even after I returned home when I went to the tire place.

She told me about her blouse. She feels uncomfortable lending it to me. She said something outside her house, everyone has seen it in her. It would be weird. It was so uncomfortable for me to ask her it was actually a little painful to hear her words after. Today she told me something else. Her mother doesn't like it. She feels guilty doing something behind her back. What if they take a picture and post in on Facebook and she sees it?

Why did that hurt even more?

I didn't even want it anymore. She could lend me her shoes, she told me to wear leggings and a sweater. But I don't want to wear that either. They're men's. My shoulders look wide. I look broad. They're male clothes. It's the same fucking thing. And again I'm nowhere. I don't have clothes. There's no point in buying if I can't really wear them.

They answered my mail from the university. The don't have the information of the plane ticket and hotel, but they will take me to Mexicali. Anna told me that she asked if we had to go formally, too. They told her no. Just take a black pair of formal trousers and they'd give us a shirt.

I don't have to wear a suit. I can buy a pair of trouser that actually fit. Be comfortable. Tomorrow I don't want to go shopping. I can't. Sunday. What difference does it make? It's not trousers that I need.

I saw the target page looking for female pants. It was a bad idea. There I remember the words I had told Catherine. Going to pride, she imagined us walking and me wearing a white dress. We could do it this year.

I can't buy them. I don't even have the money.

My body hasn't even started changing. I still have the dark, bold hairs of yesterday's laser session.

I'm worrying about what I will wear tomorrow and deep down I well know that they'll see me the same anyway.

### 2016-05-14

Today is Xennia's birthday. She was the first girl I liked. Will I remember Monica's birthday? I will remember Catherine's. Will she be the last whom I'll love?

I did go to the breakfast. It wasn't in the princess place that it was going to be. It was fine. No, it wasn't. Catherine was going to pick me up. Yesterday's night I didn't ask my dad to move the pick up and jetta because I wouldn't need to. The phone sounded by 7:30 to signal me time to get up. I showered and cleaned and shaved. Would it be enough time? It wasn't. There were still some shadow on my upper lip and chin, but still less than before. Even less than the time I was at pride.

Catherine is right, there is an obvious change between then and the next one.

Catherine's parents were in the United States. Her father would take her mom to english classes and then return home to clean Catherine and take her to the breakfast. He didn't. She told them she had to be there by 10. She did. It didn't matter. I ended up wearing the white blouse and long black sweater. Jeans and tennis. At the last minute I swapped them for the monk strap shoes. They are longer but still a little feminine.

I exited before they told us they were on their way. In the morning my grandma was with Luis downstairs. She woke my mom up. My father was down, too, by the time I had finished putting on make up.

I would have to go through all of them. I did. I asked him to move the cars. He asked me where I would be going and when would I return. He gave me some money. 100 more than he always gives me. Was that on purpose?

Did he notice? Paola noticed. By the time she saw me she said I looked pretty. Was he feeling guilty? no. Maybe he was worried.

I parked by the end of the neighborhood and tried to put lipstick. I didn't like how it looked. Neither the pencil nor the stick. I cleaned my mouth with the second to last make up wipe. Just a couple minutes ago I used the last one. 24 times I've gone out. Maybe more, maybe a little less.

Tomorrow is the last day of resting. I want them to end. I need to feel them in my body. I'm tired, exhausted and moody. I could had sent the endo a message, I decided not to.

I had a lost call from Jessica when I was near Lili's. I went to a pharmacy and put credit. They were already there. I arrived almost at the same time that Paola. She entered with me.

We had breakfast and conversations and laughed and clapped and ate cake.

Catherine kept waiting for her father. He arrived almost by 11. It was "her fault" she didn't told them it was important for her to be by 10. He went to the swap meet and lost the lapse of time.

We all met up in the plaza. The movie was irritating. "Oh, Chevo is out with only girls" Paola said to the other one. She didn't say it for me to hear. She didn't have to.

"I wanted to tell you, but I didn't want to make you blush with all of them. You looked very pretty today. I don't know if you were wearing mascara, but your eyes were so pretty."

My legs hurt. I am tired. I want to lie in bed and just rest. Tomorrow I'll go to the United States. I told Catherine I wanted to be brave and dare ask my parents for a pair of shoes. She was excited as if she believed me. I don't dare to. I don't think I will. Even when I started this paragraph I again thought about it and consider it. Both of my parents know. It's not anything to be ashamed. Why am I embarrassed? Is it about the money? No, I would ask him anyway to give me some dollars for when I'd go with Anahi. The money comes from the same place. It's them knowing, seeing. Asking?

"Do you want them? They're woman's"

Luis was the one who said those words with the converse. My father didn't look. Would they this time?

I have to buy pants. Formal pants. Three weeks or is it two?

Catherine told me she could go with me before then. Is that really true?

Am I ready?


### 2016-05-15

I have a headache and a dull pain in my abdomen. I was going to start hte words and yet Catherine just answered my telling her about what possible thing could happen my next endo session. "What are the Tanner stages?"

5 days now. Time really does fly.

I bought the slim pants I wanted. Super slim, 34x30, formal black trousers. I looked for shoes. I asked to go to Nordstrom Racks and then wandered a couple of times in the target in Westfield plaza. I saw the ballet flats. I looked them and considered actually tried them. There were people and I didn't shave.

A little boy looked at me and babbled with a smile. I waved at him and his mother just smiled.

In target something similar happened but the mother grasped him and brought him towards her.

I don't even pretend to consider that I was seen as feminine today.

I caught a couple of glances at me. I did look.

It doesn't matter. I shaved yesterday and irritated myself. Today I didn't. I could shave tomorrow. Until next thursday will be a week since the session. Then I'll give the second report to Hiram's parents. I told my parents' Lili's proposal of being his tutor, offering his parents my assistance as an academic tutor. I could get paid in dollars for going to his house and help him with his homework.

I was nervous, still am a little. Part of me wants to be denied, "thanks but no thanks". "We'll keep the offer in mind and we'll contact you".

The lights just went out and everything shut off.

I drank the iced coffee I ordered in Starbucks late in the evening. I used to brag how it didn't affect me. Of course it does. I might not be able to sleep tonight. Yesterday I couldn't. I finished the Wolf of Wallstreet movie and stayed in bed with aching legs and a throbbing headache.

The phone welcomed me to this new day with the notification that I had broken my all time record of walking. Yesterday I walked almost five miles. That's what I used to walk every other day when I tried to do exercise. A month ago I gave another chance to start that healthy habit. I didn't do today's exercise. The day hasn't ended although I doubt if I'll do today's.

 31 days. I stopped weighting myself, too. I broke the chain of days the moment I stopped doing the routine of waking up, doing them, weighting me and eating breakfast.

We lunched today in Denny's. I ordered from the healthy selection in the menu. A steak and smashed potatoes with squash. A cup of soup and unsweetened iced tea.

What's the point?

I wanted to see the picture of me in a dress. I know I look feminine, female enough. It doesn't look weird or grotesque. There is something that I don't like, though. My body is square and broad. My stomach is a big rectangle and my legs are narrower. I look like a barrel wrapped in a thin fabric.

It's my weight, not my masculinity. I look like a fat woman.

Sure, the only thing besides a body-image complex was another. As if my sex wasn't enough I have to deal with my weight, too...
It might be about the control thing. Or the lack of hormones? I knew that the lack of testosterone will make losing weight harder.

It doesn't matter. I should just continue with the exercise. Going out to walk, try to run. Do something here inside. Keep trying, not give up.

I have the pants and they'll give me a shirt.

They congratulate me in the ceremony. I went to the Scholar Merit award thingie. The people from the University, the dean, they all shook hands with me and smiled and said how was such an honor to be there. It has happened before. It has always happened, since I was in elementary school. Teachers congratulating me, principals. In jr high they didn't know me. Not personally. Although some teachers did. They called for me for a math contest or something, being in the subprincipal's office.

Being called after high school to pick up the ENLACE's scholarship. Driving with the vice-principal, being congratulated again.

It has always happened. It means nothing now. Has it ever meant something? Was it my depression? My name?

Was it me?

Maybe Rene has a point and I am a princess with everything under my touch and yet I own nothing.

I have everything I could desire, all the things in the world but what I really want.

I am the ugly princess.

The princess who was born a prince.

### 2016-05-16

It's been more than 30 days of doing exercise and today I've recovered the routine. I weighted myself with nervousness. I didn't know what to expect. Would a bigger number come? How much? What if now I'd be worse than when I started?

173.2 pounds. 78 kilograms. 3 less than when I started a month ago. One kilo a week is the recommended amount to loose.

That and restarting the hormones was a big pushup to my mood. I miss that peculiar flavor of the red pill. In the internet they described the estradiol pill as blue. I'm not taking that precisely. I am taking half a milligram of conjugated estrogen.

A couple of weeks and I can tell him how the rest period was tiring and upsetting. My dosage is low compared to the guide I've read.

Will he dismiss me? I can't know that. It all depends on the number of the T levels I get those couple of days before. A month exactly until I see him. It's not the middle of the wait time. It's not been 4 weeks.

In two weeks I'll go to Zapopan.

I received a call from Liliana today. She wanted to ask me if she could give my number to the other helper she has. Sure, of course. And then that got me thinking. I'd be helping her, giving her advice and lending my tests. She would get paid, not me. It's not that big of a problem. Except about last week. I gave the results in Liliana's time. And then continued explaining in my hour. She was paid 40 dollars for the hour of the results and I 400 pesos for the other hour. Except she kept the whole amount of dollars and half of mine.

Do I want them to accept the proposal? Should I start researching ways of teaching studying habits? The Syllabus of High School English class?

I am nervous except I don't really know why or about what.

She asked for Ivan, and called me a beautiful boy and if I were busy (masc). I just wrote what I thought in Catherine's conversation. Was it yesterday? No, Saturday. When we were talking in her car I mentioned how I feel pressure with Chevo and the gang. With the analysis lab. I have to go as a woman. Because they know about me, they're asked to call me in a certain way and I have to look the part, for my own good.

Telling Liliana about me is doing that. Just mentioning I've started treatment will bring my name to the conversation. Do I want to keep being called Ivan? Do I want to be referred as Sofia the therapist? What would happen with the patients that already know me?

And that's the thing, I don't know. I'm not ready. Emotionally, physically... I haven't changed enough.

Yesterday I looked for online pharmacies and noticed how for the same amount of flouxetine that I pay 200 pesos I would be paying less than half. 40 pesos a bottle of pills for a week.

In the United States they sell this bottles with hundred pills. It would last me months.

That got me thinking. I want to have money to pay for clothes and shoes. I want to buy those things, but I can't buy everything by myself. I'd prefer to buy clothes than pills. I can use the excuse of asking for the price in Costco. I could tell my mom, give her my prescription or going with her the next time she goes. Passing around the pharmacy and just ask. If it's cheaper I could ask her to buy it there. She would be paying. I could give her the other prescription, talk about that medication. Yes, I'm taking estrogen and t-blockers. Yeah, the name in the prescription is Sofia. That's my name. That's the name Catherine and my friends know me by. That's the one I'll ask to be placed in my corrected birth certificate.

Does she know I'm not really her son? Does my dad?

I know saturday he saw me as I left. We moved the cars and I could see his face as he got off his pick-up. Was he disappointed or upset?
My mom asked about the restaurant. She saw the picture. My aunt liked it.

Do I look the same? Did I look feminine?

I should use the new Facebook. Ask them to use that one.

I could wait those couple of weeks until the trip. Let her pride herself with the pictures of me getting that award and the congratulations to her son. That could be the last time I'd be named Ivan in a ceremony. The last I know of.



### 2016-05-17

Do the days go faster now that they are a really lower number?


Today it's going to be a week, seven days. Tomorrow I'll go to therapy and see Catherine. Yesterday I was at her house. Last night I ended the conversation abruptly. We were talking about today's plans and tomorrow's. This is the beginning of the Psych week in the faculty. The theme was about gender. Silly me, countless times I've been fooled to believe them when they talk about gender. I keep forgetting they mean woman.

The first conference, which I didn't even plan on attending, confirmed the way I feel about the "gender theory" apathy I feel.

She, a master at law, director of the Municipal Center of Women, Lawyer and defender of Human Rights, started her conference about Violence against women. Because Gendered Violence of course is against woman. Even her statistics that showed 7% of women suffer violence and 14% of men, was overlooked.

Familiar Violence, violence against any family member was explained as that against women. Domestic violence: the one women suffer at home.

I was irritated and annoyed. The Hall was full. People were standing. As it ended all took rise and started leaving. I wanted to see the one about the integration of LGBT people and the psychologist's work with them. Just me an a couple more people were interested. If it would had started when it should. Only 5 people would be listening.

Why did I shut off Catherine last night?

She told me her mother's reaction when she told her about the trip to the university. When she asked her for permission. "Uhm, why do you need to go again?" It was better if we just went to the more interesting ones. Maybe just pick one day. If I wanted to go out It would be better Wednesday.

I was angry. I told her. "I'm sick of your mom". "It's not just her... my father also says: "Are you going out again, didn't you just went that day?"" "Well, I'm sick of them both".

It's not the permission. It wasn't just that. I do resent them.

I have to go to her house and be with her, hidden in her room. Dress as Ivan and act the character. Be her boyfriend.

We were watching Game of Thrones and she came into the room when there was a scene with sex. "Don't watch that, kids". I cringed. We're not kids. We're 23, for fuck's sake. I don't want a teenage girlfriend.

It's not her fault. Why do I resent her, too?

I can't pressure her into telling them. Into their knowing. I don't want to be the ones to tell them about me. Why do I want her to tell them?

She was going to pick me up today. She would drive. I wouldn't need to pay anything. And we had to cancel. I went all by myself.

She sent me some messages telling me how she thought about going but didn't feel too well.

I argue with myself when I drove to school. I project my own frustration towards her. I see my own indecisiveness in her. I want the changes and I want to see myself different.

In the morning I received a voice message of Liliana, telling me that she would give the next patient, n3, my number. She would contact me later and we could set up a meeting. Yesterday she asked me if she could sent the girl my number, too, so I could assess her and help her on her own evaluation with the urgent patient of last week.

I am still a little nervous about this thursday. I had forgotten about thinking about the tutorship thingie.

"Would you let me paint your toenails?" I wanted her, too. Nobody would have to see. I could hide them in my socks. Look at them by myself.

Today, the psychologist that gave the presentation of sexual diversity had his nails colored in a pinkish bright red. They were short and clean. He wore an earring, but had short hair and some beard. He was slim but not effeminate. Was he gay? does it make a difference?

"And we don't even include them in the formulary questions, where we just ask about sex and put male and female... whenever that happens, which is horribly wrong I just mark female"

I sat by myself in the corner of the hall. At first, when I got in, I sat behind Suchilt. She didn't see me nor recognized me. I moved, before the beginning, to the corner. By the second one, I move closer.

I felt invisible and hidden. And at the same time, I felt a combination. Androgynous clothes in an androgynous body.

### 2016-05-18

Today I was going to go out with Catherine. We did.

What was it about yesterday? I opened up. I told her how I've been feeling at her house. Why I was upset with what happened the night before. The thing about her parents, about Liam. Being seen as a boy in her house. That's the thing, her mother doesn't even see me as a boy, she sees me as this other thing. Something in between, changing.

It doesn't matter, I told her and she understood. "You didn't say anything, it was all "it's ok, I get it"". "That's because it was the only thing to say. I had thunk about that. It wasn't that I was expecting it, but I knew it would happen sooner rather than later"

We were in Argana. She picked me up from my house. I did the exercise and showered. I shaved in the bathroom and changed downstairs. I applied my make up and combed my hair with my fingers. Catherine was updating me about her location in her drive home. I can't remember the last time she picked me up from home. I missed it.

I looked feminine, feminine enough. I was wearing leggings and the red sweater I wore on my birthday. I took the other sweater, the open necked one, with me. She would lend me a strap blouse to wear underneath.

We parked in the Sam's parking. I wanted to change but couldn't. We moved at first, and towards our second spot a mother and her child walked. They stayed taking the books out of the boy's backpack. I couldn't undress there so I waited.

"I'm hot", "you could change in Rene's bathroom", "No, it's ok", "Put it under the sweater", "I can't I'm wearing this one" "Why are you wearing that?!"

I was sad and upset. I told her to forget it, I could change later. "Can I tell you something and you don't get mad?" "No" I told her and stepped out of the car. I was scared. I knew I could get mad, I could get even sadder. I just wanted to get out. I could see the surprise and regret on her face.

We walked towards Rene's office. Nobody looked at us or saw us. We got in the Oxxo and I bought her a bottle of water. We waited outside of the office. He was with a patient. She's the friend of the girl that was before me a year ago. Does she recognize me? There is something in her face when she looks at me. Do I care? Does it matter?

I had my session and paid for it. The dollar keeps rising. I should buy the tickets for pride now that I can. I can pay them to my father in pesos and keep Cathy's 20 note.

After my therapy we returned to the parking lot and she drove us to the River Plaza. I took my sweater off and stayed in the tank I was wearing. I felt naked with my bare shoulders exposed. The bra straps were showing. My breasts are more noticeable. I thought it was my imagination but they are bigger, fuller.

I liked them and at the same time they scare me.

What if the changes surpasses me? What if I can't change as quick as my body?

I waited in the pharmacy for Catherine's card. She bought what she needed and then we went to the book fair. I felt weird. There was something there. It wasn't the people or even the sights. I was irritated and uncomfortable. I felt like that last time I had gone to an artesanal expo with Monica. I was tired and felt sick. I just wanted to leave. We had a fight because of it.

Catherine just asked me if everything was alright because she saw me uncomfortable. I told her the truth. "Do you want to leave?" "No, it's ok. Maybe, I don't know". We left.

She drove us to the beach. We were going to eat pizza. I was hungry and she ate breakfast even sooner than me.

We stayed outside the park and in the car. She offered me to walk in the harbor or going to Argana. We could eat there or the sushi place I had proposed. We decided for Argana.

We had a different waitress from the one last week. "Has someone taken your order, girls?, are you ready [feminine]?"

She brought us our food and kept referring us as woman.

I didn't change nor clean my face before entering home. My mother, father and grandma were sitting on the table as I entered.

"How good you are at telling your leaving". My grandma was looking for me at noon. She didn't know I had left.

Nobody mentioned my outfit nor face. Not even Luis when he entered my room before I even started changing.

Do they know? Are they blind? Am I invisible?

### 2016-05-19

"I miss you already. Where is it that you are going to the master?... Do you know about the one they're going to open here in Cetys?" "No, I prefer going to the capital. For me it is best going there."

I could had told her. That was the perfect opportunity.

I did today's exercise and weighted myself. Thighs, mostly. It was hard and tiring. I ate like 8 cookies. Tomorrow I'll probably weight more. I might see Catherine. She wanted to ask me something about the tests. I just want to be out. I can shave and wear something feminine. Somewhere were we will be welcomed and attended. I just want to be seen.

Yesterday I was filling the info for the new Facebook profile. I told Catherine how I started updating the video I had sent her before she had arrived for me. I stopped just before writing the description. People on Facebook follow me there. There is a lot of acquaintances who could had seen it. Is that what I want?

Once I thought and wondered and considered and even typed the draft in my phone about the text I could publish in my profile.

I asked Catherine about what she thought.

We were in her car, driving home. I remembered my fear of injections. It's so relieving to realize that I have lost that fear. I have overcome it. Will that happen when I finally get rejected and I won't die? How relieving would it finally be to get that bigger fear?

Doesn't that have something to do with this? Sure there would be people supporting me and sending me comments and whatever. But what if someone else says something different? What about the people who won't add me? Won't they be rejecting me? They sure would be ignoring me. It would be a confirmation of my feeling of being invisible and unnoticed.

Yeah, she was right when she said that.

But then again, even one people who would add me would mean a person who accepts me just as I am. No roles, no characters, no more pretending, just unconditional support.

Am I scared? Yeah.

It is what I have been thinking.

Luis doesn't know. I picked him up today. He knocked on my door after I had walked through the table full of adults. He asked me if I could pick him up and his eyes noticed my leggings and my shirt and my eyes and lips.

I left for him a quarter after noon. I read a couple of chapters as I waited. Rossy walked with a walkie talkie in his hand and looked at the cars. She recognized me and didn't have to ask about Luis. Again, as she passed my window, she called "Sofia".

I told my mom about Costco and the medicine. I could ask about the prices, about the quantities. She said tomorrow she could go. This Sunday Miguel will have the rehearsal of the elections.

I gave the last results. The whole family was sitting in the room. I was left alone. Lili had to leave. It was just me unsupervised. I was comfortable. I tumbled some times and my words came tangled up and repeating. It was fine. I was payed. Nothing was set on stone about the tutorship. His father asked me if I could give him some books or helping him being more social.

I'm relieved is over. Tomorrow Liliana will call the other patient and tell her I will call her.

Another one who will see me as Ivan.

She asked me about the phone. She called me as I was dressed as a girl, presenting as a girl, and called me a handsome boy. I should had told her. It was the perfect time. She asked me about the master, why do I want to go there. "I prefer going there, it's better for me"... because there I can change my name and papers. Because there is safer for people like me, you know, trans.

I was meaning to make a mention. Ask her for advice. I need to tell her that I've started.

"Liliana, you remember about my, you know, situation. Catherine has told you, I guess. You knew me as Ivan and Sofia. I am trans. You've seen me dressed as a boy and as a girl. With the patients I was nervous and scared. I didn't know how to act, how to present. With the first one I was Ivan.

And sure, it was my plan all along, keep being "Ivan" professionally until I can leave to the capital and fix the papers. But I'd be lying if I said it's not tiring and a little difficult to keep this persona and role.

And, besides that, there's something else. I don't know what to do. I have started treatment. Now I'm a month on hormones and had taken a couple of laser sessions. The medication is making its effect. I guess I am scared that the changes will be faster than my own preparation.

Even now, I can't even tell you this."

Just as I can't tell my brothers and I couldn't tell my parents.

### 2016-05-20

Yesterday I read a comic about a transgender woman. Today I finished it until the latest post. I finished another one of a chilean one. They keep mentioning Santiago, and how the gay marriage in that country was still illegal and how the treat of her german friend was Palta.

I liked the art. It was simple and yet stylish.

I changed the cover picture of the Facebook profile. I haven't added anyone, yet.

I was sitting in the restroom and my mind kept wandering.

Today Catherine picked me up. When did we plan the meeting? She would come after noon. My mother took my grandma to the bus station. She left me two burritos of egg and a cup of lentils. I ate breakfast an hour after waking up. I heard the conversation like most days I do. I couldn't come back to sleep.

I'm avoiding Catherine. She sent me a message to whatsapp and I saw the conversation and yet I haven't opened it. Why am I doing this? We have talked about going to the United States, she even offered going Monday. We talked about going to the swap meet. There is transportation on the weekends. There are cheap t-shirts and clothes.

In the afternoon Anahi started a conversation with me and we ended up in that theme. I could go with her. We will see each other Wednesday. Do I know what I will wear? Does she? We should go shopping. Tuesday in the afternoon.

I answered the texts.

"Can I tell Catherine? she might buy us food". Why is it awkward? When I told her, she answered back that maybe we should go just the two of us.

Why did it irritate me? I asked for a reason. She will come to my house to watch the episode of Game of Thrones. Then Tuesday going to the US and Wednesday to the movies. It's all about permissions again, her parents.

The thought of last week came back. "It's so fucking tiring to be in a relationship with a 15 year old".

Am I avoiding her because I don't want to hurt her or because I don't want to hurt myself?

I will end up going with Anahi alone. Will I buy anything? I can, want to, buy shoes. I want to buy clothes. I could look for a white dress. T-shirts or blouses. Pants I have a couple. Skirts? I would not wear them.

I should buy the least I can. My body, I hope, will be changing. I want to lose weight, lose width in some places and gain in other ones.

She put the image in Anahi's conversation. She laughed.

Today she came home and I received her with the jeggings and her black blouse she lend me. Over it I wore the long white shirt with black stripes, opened. I changed bras twice. First it was the black one. Then I put on the blue to see if it would make some cleavage. I came back to the black one.

We started kissing and laid in bed. We fucked like we hadn't in a long time. I touched her, she touched me. I narrated like she used to. "Do you like it how my fingers play with your clitoris? How yours are touching mine? I love how both our hands are in each other's vaginas."

We both nearly climaxed. She penetrated me. I returned to making her come. We stayed in bed naked under the sheet. We were laying there, in silence, when the keys open the locked door and the sound of steps moved us from bed. She covered herself in my sheets and I stood up to lock my door. It was Miguel. He opened the fridge and then went upstairs. We put on our clothes again and got ready for leaving.

She picked up some shoes for her mom. I accompanied her and watched the catalogue. We looked around Coppel and some other stores. She took me to Macroplaza to eat. Alitas. We were welcomed in the feminine way by both waiters. I couldn't hear the second time she addressed us after we ordered the drinks and she heard my voice.

I knew I looked fine. I knew I looked feminine. I had sent a snap to several people and Anahi answered back "pretty".

Why did the reflection in the windows and mirrors lied to me then?

I kept seeing the man I see yesterday in most of my pictures.

Will he ever disappear?

In the bathroom I remember the pictures, today's leggings. Did I took hormones when I went to the Universal Studios? Had I started yet?

Tomorrow it'll be exactly a month. 21st of April was the day I started. Would that be my second birthday? Am I one month old?

### 2016-05-21

I think I just said the wrong thing.

"How am I not getting exalted? I fucking hate your mom. Just now, look what happened. You were going out, you told her and she "just forgot", and you're going to work, goddamn it, something she doesn't.
"'Come pick me up and that's it', the fuck?, you don't ask her to pick you up and yet she bothers you everytime you go out. she didn't even ask 'can you come', no, 'come pick me up'.
"She's always out and you have to count the times you leave, don't be fucking kidding me."

"You are a 15 year old girl that "doesn't have to tell her, you have to ask for permission", but at the same time have the fucking responsibility of picking her up because she can't take a bloody cab

"Leave now so you're on time, she will surely reprimand you that how you dare be late and making her wait"

"The last one hurt me. Sometimes you can be very cruel".

She had a reason for not wanting to tell me about her mom. I do get mad. Why does it bother me so much? She's right now explaining herself. I might be right, but it hurts her. She doesn't express herself like I do. She doesn't know what to do, how to solve her situation.

I don't know what to do myself. I feel, too, how she's stuck. I am frustrated as well. I never told her about the thought I had when I cut the conversation. When was it and because what? Was it when I told her I was sick of her parents?

"I'm fucking tired of being in a relationship with a 15 year old."

Was that what hurt her? Was the age? I know feeling like a child is a sore spot to her right now. She feels she's in an arrested development. It hurts her not being able to grow, needing their help more than the last years. She was independent, lived by herself, needed nobody in another country. That's why it was so damaging coming back and being treated again as a child. Now, after surgery, needing care from their parents feels like confirming her helplessness. Like a kick being down.

"You didn't talk to me yesterday because of that?" "I don't remember if it was yesterday" Last night it was because of not being able to go to the United States. No, I told her I wouldn't touch the subject. It was before. It was when I told her I had enough of her parents. That thought is older than a night. Yesterday I felt bad because of the pictures, how I perceive myself.

It's almost 9 and she hasn't leaven.

Today I woke up early and we went to the United States. The business cards were already in the mail. The spit kit had arrived, too. We ate in the Jack in the box. I haven't done today's exercises. In target I looked around the shoes section. I passed by the woman's clothes. I didn't even wander through the man's area. I bought a mason jar for drinking water. Luis wanted pizza. From the Starbucks I ordered a coffee frappe. It was too sweet and a little disgusting.

The cable from my earphones keeps grazing my nipple through the t-shirt. It feels so sensitive. Today is a month since the start. May 21st. Less than four weeks I can talk to the endocrinologist. A little more than three I will get blood drawn again.

She hasn't answered. Maybe she left already. Part of me wants to be right, I want her mother to scold her for being late. "I told you to pick me up a quarter before 9". I would be correct, and she would be devastated. Being right would mean the worst for her. "I'm not telling it's not true". And then a confirmation of her being both a child and responsible for her mother.

I changed the picture from the Facebook profile. I added both her and Anahi. She was my first friend, just as in real life a couple of years ago. She was the first person to meet me. Anahi was the second.

"I love you" she sent me in a text. "I love you, too" I answered with an emoticon. "Precious". Did she see the notification? Did she see the profile?

"Adding me doesn't just mean my mother seeing. Everyone from college and high school might see it, too. Are you ok with that?"

I didn't know. I had thunk about it. I hesitated.

I guess I was alright. I hope I am.

### 2016-05-22

It hurts me to live a fragmented life.

The screen is blue with an F enclosed in the upper screen. Before, whenever I would sign out, this welcome screen would appear the next time I opened the application. It offers me to enter just selecting the picture of my face over "Ivan". The first couple of times I signed into the other application felt like the times I would go out with Catherine or wear the attire for a time in the hotel. An exit from daily life and signing into this different persona. I finished the profile yesterday and started adding people. All of my close circle of friends have me there. So it would fit this surreal excitement and feeling of accomplishment when the notification popped up offering me to get a one click sign in. The new picture and name in the welcome screen. It would be so convenient. The phone knows it's my profile. Mine. It's me.

I didn't expect the familiar pain of seeing both pictures and names. Two personas. I am two people. Different and separated. I am a broken entity. Some days I'm one and others the other. With some people I'm known as this and to others that. Even by the same person I can be called by two names in the same day.

"That you haven't done it, that you've not been able doesn't mean that you won't be able to, Sofi. See how far you've gone this year.
Every time you're closer to living a single life, yours, being whom you are"

"Did you know some people say there might had been a transexual general in the Mexican Revolution?"
Did you know I am one, too? Did you know one lives with you in this same house?
"What?"
He repeated himself.
"Where did you see that?"

I keep thinking he knows something, suspects something. What if he asks because of him?

Why does it keeps scaring me?

I won't hide my clothes nor my make up. Not anymore. "Are you wearing make up?" Yeah. "Are those woman's clothes?" Sure.

I keep practicing those words. Will I be able to pronounce them? Won't I be mute?

Tomorrow Catherine will see her patient again. She'll come after. We will see the Game of Thrones episode of today. I watched a movie. Amores perros. I posted it in my Facebook profile. Do I feel the need to use it like I felt with Twitter? I can't remember the last time I posted something there.

The day after tomorrow I will take Catherine to the United States. A couple of fights came because of that plan. She will go after all. I need her. I feel weak and needy, but I do. I could go by myself or even with Anahi. But I know it's not the same.

Will this be the first time that we'll go shopping, the three of us? The plan with Anahi was to buy something for the day after, our going to the movies with Paola. "A girls' movie time", she mentioned. It feels so gracious, like a favor done specially to me. I keep remembering how I told Rene. It's damn if they do, damn if they don't. I thought those comments would neglect me. And now that they're inclusive I don't believe me. I am the one who rejects herself.

I do get sadder. The rest period has ended so that is no longer an excused. I am on my 5th week of hormones. 32 days. by the 56th would be the 8th week and time to get reviewed. Monitored. My levels would be checked, he would ask me for effects, how I've been feeling. I keep downplaying my progression thinking of the low dose and how there has been no significative changes and my levels will be similar.

I prepared what I could show him and ask for a larger dose.

Time keep passing. In a week I'll be in another city, boarding a plane to another State. A day after I'll receive a medal and an award. A couple days after the next week I'll be again in the laser place, getting my facial hair zapped. A couple of days later, I'll be dressing femininely to get my blood drawn. A couple of days later, I'll be seeing him. He will be seeing me. Will he note changes? Will he tell me how he got me in a low dose on purpose to check for secondary effects or because he perceived that I have a natural high levels of estrogen? No.

I don't know. There is still time until then. There should be other things in my mind.

### 2016-05-23

I woke up like any other day. I don't remember dreams. Yesterday I narrated the last one just before sleeping. The lift nad running in a suit. As it climbed the floors it went narrower and narrower. Jessica was with me. I carried a luggage.

I did the exercise and weighted myself. The whole routine that I've been avoiding. I thought, was afraid of the number being so much higher. It stayed constant. Just like the one from three days ago. That number is not the lowest but is 7 pounds lower than a month ago. That's good.

I ate the tacos that my grandma made me. The biscuit is still in the fridge. She was preparing food. "Your mother said to ask you if you wanted me to cook the meat in the freezer. If you thought it was old, you could buy some and she'd paid for it when she arrives."

I didn't want to leave home. The plan was showering and putting pajamas. I would receive Catherine casually. Now I had to say no. I had to deny them going. I was in the bathroom when she came with the news. "No, cook the meat, it's alright, I don't want to leave."

I felt down. It's so much burdening to feel their needs. If I don't go, there won't be anything to eat. My grandma can't drive. Miguel is in school. Everyone is busy. I don't do nothing. A little favor is too much to ask me.

I don't know how to ask for meat. What should I ask for? "What do you want young man?" I will be told. It hurt even imagining it.

I don't want any. Cande put some soup and rice. I stayed in the couch. It might not be such a good idea for Catherine to come. Everything was ruined because some really stupid shit.

It just went off.

I entered the shower and cleaned myself. I put shampoo and conditioner. I used for the first time the cream I bought for styling my hair. I even shaved my legs in there. I opted for using the machine. Tomorrow I can go for a closer one. I drove to the meat place near home, besides the first oxxo. I entered the place where they sell tortillas and bought the chorizo. The Oxxo was closed and there were no chicken in the meat place. I drove to the other one near the Calimax. I bought the chicken there and the chipotle chilis.

It was before all of this when I was standing in my room doing something in the phone as it sounded and the logo of the UABC appeared in the screen. They had the information of the hotel and the flight. I should just take a black pair of formal trousers and they'd give me the shirt so all from the university will go matching.

That was the fist phone call. The second was the patient. At first I tried to answer the same way I did with the university except it didn't come thru. It was a missed call. I tried returning the call but it was misdial. I just decided to wait. Catherine was just leaving to meet her patient. She'd be here by 4 and a half. He was late but arrived just at the limit of time she decided to give him.

Cande kept asking me if I wasn't hungry. Was I going to wait for my mother to arrive?

By four someone called home. I picked up the phone and didn't recognized the number. I answered with an androgynous voice. Not too feminine but yet changed still. I found familiar the one from the auricular. "Who is this? " It was Miguel. He left his keys behind the television. I felt how my voice lowered as I recognized him. Did he notice?

He stayed in the table eating. My grandma made him some eggs and warmed a bowl of rice with beans.

Just minutes before Catherine's arrival they both went upstairs. We ate together in the table and shared my mason jar filled with tea. The phone rang for the third time. This time I could answer the patient. I set the meeting for 6 o'clock this thursday. It was all set. I will have another patient.

 After the meal I put on the episode. The sound of the keys in the door made me pause the show as my dad entered. I thought it was going to be Luis or my mom. They came later. A little after they entered, my grandma came down. They have met already.

Tomorrow I'll see her again. I could gather 75 dollars. That should be enough. Yeah. I could buy some things.

Why am I nervous? Nothing bad should happen. I will wear feminine clothes but not completely. They can't deny me entrance for looking "gay". It's not a disguise. I won't be having make up. Not much anyway.



### 2016-05-24

I'm home. I've taken my pills and refilled the organized with the missing ones that Catherine bought with her card.

According to the app in my phone today's walked steps are over 7 thousand. I don't know how many kilometers are that. I bought what I was supposed to buy. I wanted flat shoes and t-shirts and I even bought a blouse. I tried a dress.

It should be enough, why it doesn't feel that way? Even crossing the border as I was wearing nothing but foundation somebody offered something to us saying ladies. It wan't the only one. In Victoria's Secret the lady approached Catherine and me with the same opener. Ladies. There were one or other person who I know saw me in the same way.

I was nervous. There was almost no line. Catherine kissed me and left the mark of her kiss, like a signature on my cheek. I felt along the day this weird sensation in my anus. At first it was uncomfortableness. Now it's a really low pain. Last week was when Catherine came and we fucked in my bed. It's been days. It's not that, is it? No. It must be something else.

I sat in a bench after crossing the border. I was asked just where I was going, nothing else. Have a really great day, the officer wished me with kindness. Do people notice? He saw my picture and name. He saw me. I tied my hair and crossed the sweater over my chest. In the bench in the trolley station I opened my purse and asked Catherine if I finished my make up. One person saw me as a girl. It was confirmed, why did I still need it? I felt void and vulnerable. As if a part of my face were missing. I don't want the make up to look "pretty"
I want it, need it, to look normal.

She told me to wait until Anahi arrived. I could put it on in her car. I don't know how to do it when it's moving, I explained. We could stop and do it before stepping down to the mall. "Could you help me?" "No. Do it yourself."

She asked me if it hurt me. Why did I say no? It wasn't precisely hurt how I felt. I was upset and angry. It's not fair. I wish I could put it on in my house, too. I wish I could just wear it normally and everyday. It's not because I hide it from the people who live here. Would I had exited and let my grandmother see me?

I took a pair of jeans for when I return. They still are in the car. On the floor are the box of flats, too. Why won't I wear them tomorrow from here?

I ate two tacos and then a bowl from chipotle. That's all of the intake from today. I lost a fraction of a pound in the scale.

I went by myself to the dressing room. A blouse, a t-shirt and a dress. I tried everything on. They were L, and they fit. I looked fine. I really did. From the three items I tried, I only bought one. The other three t-shirts are of different colors. One is XL and the other two are L. The L ones don't fit me. They do, but they are too slim. I feel like a bloated piece of meat wearing them. I feel like my body is puffed up and muscular, like an adult wearing the clothes of their younger sibling.

I have shoes now.

What will I wear tomorrow? Both to therapy and to the movies. I do want to go, I do want to be seen and noticed.

Does that hurt me? That they are really no comments in this house? I am unnoticed.

I talk and am not heard. In the gas station the attendant put his ear in the window. He welcomed me in hte masculine form. And yet he didn't hear me.

When I try to change my voice it comes out as a whisper. A shy try of words.

The cashier in the payless shoes asked me if my hair was naturally curly. It looked pretty. Do I mind, even now I just recognize how they say my hair looks good. I don't look pretty with my curly hair, no, my hair on my head looks pretty. As if it were an extension separate of me.

Am I that? A separation? My hair is pretty, my chest is feminine, my crotch is masculine.

I am both Sofia and Ivan.

I am not a girl nor a boy, I'm a chimera.





### 2016-05-25

I cried a little on the way home. I almost cried in the start of my session.

I'm typing these words. I haven't talked with Catherine since we said our good-byes outside La Creperia. Paola didn't show up. Her parents had problems with their car and were waiting for a mechanic.

The untranslated items of the NEO300 are on top of my laptop. I try sharing my frustration and impotence with Rene about don't knowing how and when to come out as a female psychologist. He answered back saying how it was an opportunity. I had big chances with working from within the community. Is that really what I want? Catherine remembered me the comment I said. Do I really want to spend my whole life surrounded by people like me? Will I define myself because of my "situation"? People will go with me not because of my abilities or my personality, I will literally be defined by the state of my genitals. I would be the trans psychologist.

I am doing fine. Not really, I am getting 200 pesos each week. That's not enough to make a living. Yeah, I am just starting.

"You're doing well... you are doing nothing... you're not giving your card or your CV around" I was hurt by that. It hurts me that they say I don't do nothing. I tried, again and again. It wasn't just when I felt bad or that I gave my curriculum on purpose to places where they asked for female applicants. Maybe that was the last brick of the wall.

I wore the flats that I bought yesterday. I wore one of the blouses, a purple one, the t-shirt that was L instead of XL. On top I put the black sweatshirt I took from the laundry basket. It smelled good enough. I had make up already, black eyelashes and red lips, when I decided to tell DoÃƒÂ±a Cande I would be leaving. I said aloud but she didn't hear me. I climbed the stairs and again spoke. The same silence. I had to do it, I had to come in and show myself. Except I did not, really. The third time she heard and answered back.

My feet hurt from the walk. I was early. The tears almost made an appearance as I talked about the complications I have because of whom I am. It's tiring and frustrating and I wish I didn't have to go through this.

I met Catherine in the parking lot. Everyone of the three of us was driving their car. Did somebody gendered me correctly today? Rene told me "como ibas vestido?" "el unico trans". I kind of expect it from him. Liliana called me "mi niÃƒÂ±o hermoso". Anahi told us: "Ã‚Â¿dÃƒÂ³nde estÃƒÂ¡n estacionados? Los llevo". Catherine said: "nosotros". Paola told us she would not catch up with us because of her parents after saying "chicos!".

She said it herself, it would be a girls' evening. Even then, both Catherine and Anahi were upset and difficult. We ate in the DinastÃƒÂ­a 12. I ordered and iced coffee and Catherine a chai tea. After Anahi's arrival each one of us asked for a sandwich. We were leaving to GalerÃƒÂ­as, when I saw how they were stopped. I returned in reverse to where they were. Paola's last misgendering and yet they were indecisive about what to do.

Anahi didn't want to see the movie, she asked about going to argana. Catherine wanted to see the movie, she told me herself. Even then, they looked at me and didn't want to choose. I can't remember who was the one to make the call. I asked to follow her but she dismissed me. I left.

In Argana I realized they would ask our ids with Anahi. She looks youngish. What would happen? Catherine didn't want to choose a flavor. I said I wouldn't even be smoking. The were difficult again. Now there was no point in smoking just the two of them. Anahi wanted a crepe but here were expensive and the nutella was extra. What to do, stay or leave? Again nobody said anything. The waitress came and asked our order. I took the call this time. I was annoyed and angry.

In the ride home I thought about all of that, and the misgendering came up again.

And instead of anger I felt such sadness that I cried by myself.

I wore flats, woman's jeans, a blouse, everything but my sweatshirt was female. I wore make up, I looked "fine". What more do I need to do? What more do they expect? What am I lacking so I can stop being seen as a man?

I can't take this anymore. I am tired, sick of this. Can I correct them? Do I deserve it?

Have I done enough?

When will I accept myself?

### 2016-05-26

Look at me, come on. Come, enter, see me. I'm showing you, I'm exhibiting myself. I'm naked. Why don't you notice me?

I talked about yesterday with Catherine. I feel sad and down. I'm tired. Catherine and Anahi were right. I couldn't sleep in the night. "I'm sorry, your mom and I kept you up at night with our chat", yeah, they did. "At what time did you went upstairs?" "2 in the morning".

I had to get up from the bed in the late night or early morning to take a couple of pills for the pain. My feet were hurting and acting. A day in woman's shoes and I was miserable.

I sent the first message to Catherine since yesterday's good bye. "Are you angry?"

She stayed in Playas. I saw when Anahi's car left and I took a right turn in the park when she kept straight. Catherine's car didn't leave. She stayed there and started crying. She couldn't drive like that. She only remembered the phrase she told me, that I was doing nothing. That I keep doing nothing to change my job situation.

She explained how she felt upset since Paola's cancellation. I remember a week ago when they planned it. Seeing this movie. "Why this one? I really want to see this one", she told me. She wanted to see it just with me. I offered her to see it before everybody. Going just the two of us. We didn't have to tell anybody. She felt it was unfair. I spent through the same thing with the Captain America one and I didn't get to see it before.

So, yesterday, they planned it and one didn't want to go and the other one didn't even show up. She couldn't get mad with Anahi because of what was she going through so she got mad with me instead.

Until we left did she notice how she treated me the whole day.

Did I? Notice.

It wasn't that what made me cry on the way home. Nor today when we talked about.

I was telling her the impotence I get of kept being seen as a man. Sure, they can call me Sofia and say she or her. Yet I am betrayed by the plurals. "I don't know what goes through their heads that they mess up the plurals. I do. I know what to infer.

They might see me as female. Yet they don't see me as the same type of female. They accustomed themselves to call me as she. "Whenever I talk of him, remember to use she". I am the freak who changed sex. But I am not the same as Catherine. So, when they talked about the two of us. The use the neutral one. That's more unconscious. The reflex is gone. They see the multitude and if they talk about Catherine and Anahi, they are two women. If they talk about me and Catherine, we are a woman and something else. In spanish with a single element not being female, you use the neutral masculine form.

And so, they ask about us, or use we or the male adjectives.

I am betrayed by my own language. This analysis would be impossible were we speaking english. In english I wouldn't even notice until a third party was talking about me. I wouldn't have to think about myself. My language would be ungendered.

In spanish, now, here, I have to betray myself almost everytime I speak. Whenever I try to describe how I am, I ought to decide for a gender. Every time a stranger mets me, I get to see how they see me. Wether I am welcome in the feminine or they ask if Catherine and I are ready to order in the feminine way. There I could be sure they see us as equals. Listas, they said. The a assures me they see women, and since there are just two of us, the s confirms that they see me, too.

It's the people I know the ones that hurt me. It's not their fault. It's unconscious. Paola and Anahi are the two who've tried to support me the most, who would never do something to hurt me. It's me, it's how I look, how I present. How I let them know me.

It's the people closest to me the ones that make me feel worse.

I got 200 pesos from the interview today. I received 8 bills of 50, and left four in Lili's drawer. I used two of them to buy bread. I could had just bought one or two for me. And yet I bought for everyone.

I might not even eat any tonight.

### 2016-05-27

I almost forgot to take my pills. I remember how when I started with the antidepressants it was such impossible to even imagine the day I would forget to take them. Weeks later I would leave them here in a trip to Mexicali or remember to take them late at night.
This was the first time that I didn't take the hormones as soon as I finished breakfast.

Should I put an alarm in my phone? They could remember me to take them, make a habit out of it. Like the making of these words. Almost a year since I started.

I'm eating bread, the third of the kind I stopped to buy yesterday after my session. The second one today. My mason jar is filled with Colacao. I was woken up by the phone. It rang and nobody picked it up. I did. I answered with my normal voice. Edgar thought I was Miguel. He ask me to pass him "my nana". I just walked and brought her the phone. I came back to bed. It's her birthday. I was tired and stayed in bed until almost noon.

I don't have to interpret any tests yet. I haven't administered any.

I offered Catherine to go and see the movie we missed Wednesday. Just the two of us, like the original plan. I got up from bed and walked out of my room. I congratulated my grandma and went to warm the breakfast she had prepared. Today's exercise was push-ups so Idecided to skip it. Yeah, I'll gain weight. I don't care. I don't want to get my arms wider.

I ate and then stayed in the living room. I forgot.

I sent my mom a text asking her if we were going to do something for my grandma. She didn't answer until I sent her the second an hour later telling her I was going out. "Do we take her to eat?" I was angered and frustrated. What's the point in having people who loved me if I receive nothing in return? My parents don't know my name, or the process of my transition, my friends still see me as Ivan. I don't feel comfortable. And yet I am pressured. I give more than I receive.

I don't feel like that anymore. Typing it makes me look like a spoiled brat. They know, and try to understand. If they ignore something is because I don't tell them. Because I am scared.

I decided to go out with Catherine. She picked me up. I wore the jeggings and the other L blouse. Over it the denim shirt. I paintedm y face, even wore a little color on my lips. I didn't care about being seen. Both Luis and my grandma were in the livingroom. I just wanted to be seen as a woman. I'm so sick of being seen as him, as a boy.

I walked towards Catherine's car and saw her following my path with her phone. She was wearing a dress and a denim vest. Her eyes were covered in two black circles.

We tried to catch the show in the River plaza so there would be time left in the evening after the movie. We bought the tickets ten minutes after the starting hour. Even after the stairs and the walking to the theater and the masculine welcome of the guy who took our tickets, we sat in our seats before the actual movie started. I was quiet and sad. I was deflated and demotivated. I know it was probably a mistake, an automatic response. It felt awful, though. The familiar frustration and impotence of two days ago. What else do they need or want? What is it that I am lacking still?

After the movie Catherine drove us to the teriyaki place near the university. We sat inside and ate. Nobody gendered me anyway. We took pictures before our plates arrived. She told me how she liked the way I looked. I looked very feminine when she returned from ordering. My clothes, my face, my hair...

Why would people see me otherwise, then?

Even I, after returning home, after waiting in the couch and being seen by every member of my family. I entered my room and looked at me in the mirror. I was going to take the clothes off and put my pajamas on. But I caught that glimpse and I kept looking. I saw my face, my clothes, my body. I liked it. I didn't want her to go. I didn't want to take the clothes off, or clean the make up.

I don't want to see him in the mirror.

I don't care anymore. I want everybody to stop seeing me like that. I don't want myself to ever see me like that.

### 2016-05-28

I haven't filled the agenda since I can't remember when. This will be the last night until the trip. Tomorrow will be the last event I had anticipated.

I went to the United States. I woke up early. It was before 9 in the morning. My father was in the living room. Almost everyone was ready. We came back from the other side of the border before noon. Most of the times, by that time we're usually still on this side, before crossing.

I sent the saliva sample. That was the first place we went to. It wasn't the postal Annex place where Robin, the woman with yellow hair knows us. It was in that plaza, but a little beyond. The United States Postal Office. I had never entered before. It's gone, it's sent. It's just a little more wait until they receive the results and I have an answer back.

In target we were just the four of us. I didn't dare to wander off and look for clothes. I bought a pajama bottom of deadpool and three t shirts without any sleeves. Tank tops? They're man's, so they're not blouses. Will I wear them?

I haven't done the luggage. I always wait until the last moment. I remember when I was in elementary school, those later years and I used to fantasize about going on a trip. Preparing the bags and clothes, boarding the plane, visiting those new places. Would I even had imagined the trips I would make? The places I'd meet and the people I'd know.

In these last years I've traveled to Guadalajara, Monterrey, England, Spain, Belgique, Netherlands, Portugal. I traveled across Spain and then later I would travel with Catherine to Guadalajara again and within the state. Tomorrow I'll board another plane. It doesn't excite me anymore. It's a little annoying. I'll spent the morning with her. The rest of the day will be in a bus, in the airport and in a plane, surrounded by people who know me as this person I used to be. I'll be called Ivan and seen as a man.

I want to shave, I want to wear feminine clothes, I want to look as a woman, but I can't. I have to present my id and be recognized as I legally am. The day after tomorrow I will be dressed in a formal attire and be named in a ceremony along with hundreds of people to receive an award.

This is the last time, assured me Catherine yesterday. The graduation was supposed to be the last one. They keep coming and coming.

I have no way of winning. I don't want to look as a man, but I don't want to look as a woman either. I'll be with Catherine and going to eat breakfast. I'll be received in the school and escorted to the bus to be taken to the airport two hours away from here. I'll be seeing Anna and Hilda. I don't mind them knowing, seeing me.

Where will I sleep? How will the arrangements be?

Did I make a mistake accepting to go?

The screen of my phone is broken. I thought I had this song already.

"En que momento paso? Como fue? No quise alejarte.
La noche me sorprendiÃƒÂ³, te busquÃƒÂ©, ya era muy tarde."

Will I listen to music tomorrow? I don't think there is a point in taking the ipod with me. Most of the songs I listen now are in my spotify account.

Catherine posted a picture of 6 little test tubes made for drinking shots in the group of the gang. They started making plans about using them, going somewhere. The date proposed was June 11th. That would be a day after my third appointment with the laser place. I won't be able to shave the next day. I''l look like a man, again, in the beach, again.

It's so frustrating and irritating. I'm fucking tired of being in this situation. I wish, I so wish I could have the courage to tell the world, and feeling free, showing myself however I wanted to.

Now, telling people is not liberating. I don't feel free with them. I feel trapped in my own honesty. I have to look female now. I can't waste the opportunity, now. The changes keep happening and yet I am unsure if they really exist. I see the pictures and note differences.

Tomorrow I'll leave. I'll be back the day before my session with Rene.

I can talk about whatever happens with him. I hope I don't miss the words again.

### 2016-05-29

The day is here. I'm all bather and changed and ready. I hear the sounds of the fork and plate of Luis eating his breakfast. Was I rude when I denied my grandmother "even one little taco"? I feel in a bad mood.

I am wearing a combination of men's clothes and women's. My underwear and socks both are women. My t-shirt and shoes are male. My sweater is something androgynous. I couldn't not do it. I had to hid the microscopic black spots in my facial pores with make up. I even put the ring of the university. How do I look? It was too much manly. I couldn't bear it. I can't. How will I do it?

This is supposedly the real last time they will call my name and do something about school. Every one is harder than the last.

Catherine will leave home in about half an hour. She'll come pick me up and go to eat breakfast. The last two times out they called me by the male form. Today they have to. Whenever I get to school I have to introduce myself as Ivan. They have all our names counted up and organized. X number of boys and Y number of girls. What will Hilda and or Anna do when they see me? It would not be the first time somebody sees me like this.

Do I really care?

What will happen, though, when I board the airplane? They will ask an id to corroborate the boarding pass. I am Ivan, though. I should not be scared. I can use the male voice I have such distaste with, I can explain. Nothing have to happen.

A little more than 3 hours and I'll be leaving the city. 8 hours and I'll be boarding the plane.

Why am I scared and nervous? Why does everything have to be so fucking complicated?

I wish I could had just gone in male clothes and not shaved and presented as Ivan as I did those four years in school. Why am I not able anymore? Why does it have to hurt so much?

At least I won't have to worry about these words. I'll be having the tablet and my book to entertain myself. It will be a lot of waiting. Waiting for Catherine to arrive, then to the food to come, then to the bus to receive me, then to everyone else to board, then to arrive to Mexicali, then to the time of boarding the plane, then to getting to Guadalajara and then to getting into my room. The next day I'll wait to be named and for the thing to be finished.

I'll leave the agenda behind.

I've ben filling it with a couple of days of delay. Will it end up being like the black book of school? With months in blank?

Am I lazy? What is it that impedes me to transcript my life? I haven't still passed the journals from Spain. I have several unfinished notebooks started and discontinued. How do I keep writing here?

I've lost count of the days since the very beginning. Years since those days in highschool I used to write stories. Silly dream of becoming a writer. To me it was a possibility and yet today I laugh. Would I be laughing then If I knew that by my 23 years my dream would be one of becoming a woman? To me it is a possibility.

The counter keeps coming up and up and yet it doesn't reach it's goal. I feel like I'm juicing all that's left of my thoughts and nothing of value comes up. What is it that I am repressing? What dark thought keeps blocking what really bothers me?

I said that thing about foolish dreams. I talked about my fears and frustration of the difficulties I have of being one of "them trans"

It's not fair, it doesn't translate fairly to the english. He didn't mean it that way.

He's doing his best. He should be helping me, not the other way around? Why am I still so "confluente"?

Catherine hasn't answered my test. She was leaving the shower. Will she arrive before my parents leaving? Will I face them?

If I am not as afraid as I deny to be, why do I keep hiding in my room after changing?

Everybody here has seen me already in these pants. The shirt is man's. Why am I scared of being seen almost as much as staying invisible?

### 2016-05-30

I'm in the Telmex auditorium. I'm sitting here in the place where is stamped my name. I've been chatting with Catherine. Yesterday, since the University I've been talking and being with both Hilda and Anna. I was dressed pretty androgynously. I had the jeggings and a tank top with the white and gray sweater over. When Catherine picked me up and took me to breakfast, the waiter welcomed us as ladies.

Hilda was the second person to come. The coordinator that sent me the emails called me when we were parked outside the restaurant. She drove us to Mexicali with a man. I sat besides a lawyer. Hilda and Anna were seating behind me. I gave them two of my cards.

Hilda's mother reached her hand to met mine. She told her something about taking pictures. "You can take turns. You take pictures of, uh and, uh, to you..."

She hesitated with the pronouns. Will she ask her who and what I am, when we return?

I was afraid of whom would I share room with. How would they separate us? I didn't want to be with a man. I didn't want to be a nuisance to a woman. A man would feel weird with me, a woman would do so, too.

In the plane our seats were dispersed. I met my parents in the airport. I stayed with hilda and Anna. We looked for something no eat. Since breakfast we would not take a bite until reaching here. I ordered a chicken soup. They didn't wait for us. After we finally checked in our bags, we stood in line for security. They didn't say anything about the id or my appearance. As we entered the gate's waiting area, the coordinator of scholar services asked opus if we (feminine) were the last. One of them corrected her.

I'm still waiting. They told us that the breakfast would be served by 7 in the morning. The bus would leave at 8 o'clock.

They called the name of the first girl of the list, the one behind me, when they started assembling us for the rooms. They said her name and then one of another girl. I would be with a man. One of the two girls went to the desk and signed the little piece of paper. They said my name and another one with the same last name. "JosÃƒÂ© FernÃƒÂ¡ndez and Sixto FernÃƒÂ¡ndez". I went to the desk. The receptionist gave me the folio with our names written. The lady with the wood table kept repeating the name. Once, twice. I raised my hand and she called it again. "I'm here, I said".

The lunch box they gave us had a ham sandwich, a bag of chips, a can of soda and a packet of cookies. I started eating the sub, amazed that it had no cheese. By the second bite, a rancid milky taste crawled by my tongue. I opened again the bread to inspect it more meticulously. It had a certain kind of white cream with little squares solidified. I tried scraping it with my finger, or just biting it by the edge. The same distaste kept appearing between mouthfuls. I ended wrapping g the tomatoes and slices of avocado with the ham and eat it without any bread.

I changed clothes, put on my new pajama and lied in bed.it might had been a little after one. One hour or a little more passed before I could had fallen asleep.

The first alarm was set at 10 minutes to 6,it sounded just for an instant. I entered to the dark bathroom and sat on the toilet. I brushed my teeth although I hadn't eaten any food yet. I shaved with the machine with the faucet running. I had little black spots but the machine did close to nothing.

I combed my hair with my fingers and the serum my mother bought me. He was the next to use the bathroom. Was he annoyed because of me waking him up? Yesternight we stayed in the little living room of our room, sitting in the two chairs, eating, talking. He was nice enough. He heard my name. I know it because he remarked how I was a FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, too. That is actually correct. I didn't know it, none of his four ones.

Would another man had made a comment? Asked something? Why do I wear that kind of clothes, why do I look like that? He actually was the one besides me in the plane. His hair is long and his beard, too.

I feel a rumbling in my stomach. I did eat breakfast. I drank coffee, too, and I feel drowsy and tired.

This thing should had started 8 minutes ago.

I put on the slim pants I bought. They are more flexible and comfortable than other pants. I did like them. They look the same, though, the cut is similar, they're not more tapered than other ones. The shirt they gave is a boring kind of green. It's a man's one. Maybe they all were the same. I stepped down to the breakfast buffet. I took my pills with me wrapped in a little tissue. I had planned taking them in front of Hilda. Yesterday after landing and disboarding the plane, she asked me to hold her sweater. "I have to take my pill". "oh, is it for your throat?" "No, they're actually anticontraceptives."she answered back nonchalantly. I could do the same.

"Why do you take so many pills?" "Oh, they're just anticontraceptives."
It's funny trying to imagine her face, her reaction.

"These two, they make me smile, this one makes me cry more, this one makes me less manly, and this one makes me not being pregnant."

Did thus saved already? I lost an almost 200 streak because of a fucking phone.

It appears to be starting.






### 2016-05-31

Fuck me. It would had happen again had I not returned to try again.

I'm home. I've returned from my trip. Rene sent me a text message asking if he could see me at 10 or noon. It's better this way, I guess. It's fine.

On the way home, I told the woman Ruth, the coordinator of scholar services that I would be coming home with my parents. I fell asleep most of the way. I could not sleep in the plane.

The last entry, the one from the day before, is written from the auditorium. Did I write about the bathroom? Was it the first time someone gendered me female that day?

After returning to the hotel, I went straight to my room and changed into jeans and the pinkish red tank. I planned on using the long black sweater but instead I put on the white shirt. Sixto, my roommate was already sitting down waiting for the food. I sat beside him and there were other people, too. Just men. Mostly Law students from Mexicali. They were talking about what they would do, the places they would go. The coordinator, the white haired woman was sitting on the other side of the tables. There were salad plates already placed in front of each seat.

"Gentlemen, invite your lady mates. Take them with you, don't leave them alone."

It was jr high again. I was one of the men. It was the opposite of the comment I almost posted last night about a group of only females being called by the neutral male because of my presence. Now we were a group of only men even though I was present. It's not about not being noticed. It's being noticed and still not changing anything. I didn't want to spend the rest of the trip like that. A little after came Ana and told the woman how she was going to stay with her family. "Oh, it's ok, I trust your family. I know you will be ok with them. Let me just give you my phone in case you need anything." She left. I assumed Hilda would go with her. I felt betrayed, abandoned. They would spend the day with Ana's family, they might show her the city. I would be here with these men. Just like Spain when I tried to fit in with the people in the botellones.

The salad had cheese and it was hard eating enough so the plate would not seem full. The soup was garlic cream. It tasted just as it sounds. Almost as distasteful as the way I was already feeling. The main dish was served to the side of the white haired woman. It was Pasta Alfredo with salmon or something like that. I would not eat it. I felt frustrated. I remembered my family. My family was there, too. I told Sixto I would go for my phone and to tell the waiter that he could take the plate.

Up there, I sent my mother a message. Had they already eaten? No. Could I go with them? Sure. They were downtown. I would take a cab and meet them there. I came down and went directly with the woman. "I have family here, too and I wanted to go with them..." She looked at me with an annoyed and distrusting face, "oh do you, too?" She used the more formal usted. It wasn't male, but I felt like I were in school again, being addressed as a little boy. "...yeah, they were... in the... with me... I just, would you give me your phone?". She dictated me her numbers and I heard the comments from the guys. "Oh, yeah, now everybody has family" "Yeah, his family just appeared to not be with us" "Yeah, go, don't be with them", she commented me with a lighter mood.

As I walked and exit the eating place, I saw the plate still in my table and everyone's look on me. Did they hate me? Did they comment on how good it was that I left? I was so weird anyway, I looked like a girl and was so quiet. Maybe I were gay and liked somebody there. Fucking faggot.

I felt the tears in my eyes as I asked for a cab in the reception. It was called for me and drove me there. In the way he told me about this passenger he got. A beautiful young girl who tattooed a spider-web over half of her face. He criticized her and judge her. I just followed his way and felt dirty. Would he judge me, too? Would I be changing permanently my body, mutilating it, just like her? "He was such a handsome boy and destroyed it with estrogen."

I ate with my parents in the same restaurant I went with Catherine once. My mother took several pictures. In one of them, she told my father to capture it in a way that the whole kiosk appeared behind us. "Do you want the picture of that or us [nosotros]?" "Both" she answered while we smiled and looked towards the camera. "[nosotros]..." I hear this right. the rest I don't know. I have no reason to doubt it. There was a silence and then other words. There is nothing else she could had said. "[bueno, es nosotras]".

I hiperventilated and felt my heart race. No, you did not say that. I heard wrong. I felt just like I did with the words of the Karaoke. It wasn't the pressures of the other woman just like it wasn't then the sights and comments and the auditorium. It was being addressed in the feminine. Not knowing if it was real. Distrusting my perception. That was the reason I texted Catherine and felt my eyes water again.

A couple of times while we walked and shopped around, people called me in the feminine way, or used the plural female with my mom and me.

We saw some places and took some pictures. My dad ordered an uber which took me to the hotel. There were some other students in the lobby who saw me as I stepped down from the car. I heard some of their words. "Well, yeah, but they did said we could each go our own ways."

I went to my room to charge my phone. Sixto was already asleep. I came outside to the living room. I stayed there a while and though about buying something in the vending machine downstairs. A soda, something. I walked down. There was this man in a white shirt and suspenders giving a file to somebody. He asked me if I knew him. No. It was forgotten there. He would see him today that we return.

I was planning on asking if the sodas costed something or if I could just take one, when the guy turned to me and asked me if I was from UABC, too. What did I study. Mexicali or Tijuana. Did I go somewhere, had I been there before. Oh, they were just downtown, too.

"What are you gonna do now?... We are going for a little beer, do you want to come?"

Oh, no, I'm fine, thank you, you go and have fun, it was nice meeting you. "uh, yeah, sure".

I even left my phone in my room. They were the three Law majors from Tijuana. Him and his girlfriend, other lawyers, too. And me, the psychologist who looked like a girl.

Why was he so nice? We walked a couple of blocks and entered a wings place. One ordered nuggets and the girl wings. He and I each asked for french fries. We all ordered the 5 liter thing. Dark beer. Was it Indio? It was good.

I drank, faster than most. Maybe more, too. It seemed like it. I felt my tongue being loosened. I felt just like Spain, drowning my gender dysphoria in alcohol. Digging and hole and hiding it there. I talked more, opened up. It was different to the first couple of minutes that I felt invited out of pity, ignored and invisible. Like a lost dog kept under the table for giving him what is dropped.

We returned and went to one of their rooms. I wasn't really invited, but it wasn't as awkward as I thought it would be entering.

We kept talking, asking questions. Listening to music. By the end of it, it was almost one o'clock. We talked about his thesis on the gender quota. How it is still gender discrimination trying to fill a quota on gender. At first I felt passionately about the theme, I wanted to talked about it, being heard, understood. Then I realized it was still a delicate subject and what was in the alcohol grave resurfaced. It didn't hurt but it wasn't repressed anymore.

"I don't care if you are a man, or a woman, or a chimera" almost everyone laughed, "or an alien. It's about what you can do."

I am trans. I am one of those chimeras. They don't know. Would they had invited me anyway? Would I be standing here drinking with them? Am I really this different?

He talked about going to Tijuana in September and visiting some friends. "Add him so he knows and goes, too". He invited me. I was taken in count. I fitted in.

But at what price? How would I look in september? Would they really add me on Facebook? Would they note the post I was supposed to write?

Today in the breakfast Hilda touched my shoulder and said "today you didn't sent us a message". They didn't spend the day together as I had assumed. Ana went to her family and Hilda to her friends.

In lunch, everything from the salad to the dessert was not served to me. Ranch and cheese in the salad. Mushroom cream for the soup. Pasta carbonara as the main plate (pasta with eggs, bacon, cream and cheese). And for dessert, a creamy mousse.

I was anxious about leaving. My parents were already in the airport. The white haired woman was still unseen. It was 2 o'clock and we hadn't even left the room. The check out time was noon with an hour of consideration.

Hilda and Ana were the last one to come to the bus. I sent her a message but it was unseen.

In the airport, it felt a little different than when we first went. The tickets were not printed.

I bought a ham sub to fill my stomach. I bought a bracelet to Anahi and a little bottle of coffee liquor to Catherine and me. When we landed, the little kid in front of me that didn't stayed calm the whole flight wanted to exit first. Her mother tried to keep him quiet. In a possible outburst he threw the water bottle and tried to step on it. It was taken from under his foot. He threw another step almost upon my own shoe.

The mother told him "If you step on her, she will scold you". I smiled to him. I smiled for myself.

My parents were asked if they were just the two of them. They were offered moving to one of the emergency exits. My parent answered "yes, no, we're three, we're with Him" and pointed at me. The stewardess looked at me. They were not moved.

I forgot the black sweater in my uncles' house. I decided not to return. It's the most feminine male piece of clothing I own. I will miss it.

I don't know what I'll do tomorrow. Or wear.
