### 2016-09-01

What happened this morning? I was going to take my grandma to the store. Yesterday I said to them how there was a crafts shop in the plaza near the 5 & 10 down the neighborhood. We could go there. Later, talking with Catherine I came to realize it wasn't here in the plaza, but in the mall near her house. I could go pick her up and take my grandma to that store. After returning home, we could stay a little until going to jhonny's.

I got up from bed. I did not need the alarm I put last night. I was awake when Luis and grandma talked over breakfast. I heard the morning chats and the sounds of their routines. I stayed in bed and continued sleeping. It was near 10 when I finally got up. This time there was no breakfast ready. I heated the biscuit from Sunday and fried and egg to exchange the one within. I took my pills and watched the fraction of the episode that was airing of Law and Order SVU. The clothes were ready. I'd be wearing the new red dress, today would be the ceremony of jhonny. He'd see me again, for a second time as sofia. This time I'd be wearing a dress. Would I encounter other classmates? Some teachers?

I showered and shaved my legs and chest and face. Everything was set and done. My grandma came to my room as I was still in pijama with the hair wet and told me that I could go by myself to the store and just buy three packets of the pearls and the shakiras. The store is besides the oxxo. They usually have them in little containers like ketchup? Something like that. I put on the dress and make up. Nothing fancy or extravagant, the usual. I drove down and entered the store. There was a young woman and an older one. I asked them if they had something like those and showed them the two little baggies of pearls. They told me no, and then looked for the shakiras. They had a plastic bowl filled with bags of tinny and shinny little pieces of plastic of several colors. They looked inside one that matched the one I showed them. A boy with uniform and a backpack came and asked for the homework he just sent to the printer. They turned to him and answered his questions while making the transaction of my things.

I paid for the bags and they referred to me as she. "Give her back her change" "She left me without any change, she's going to take it all".

I drove back and paid half of the price from my money. I returned 90 of the 100 pesos that my grandma had given me to pay. I stood in front of her with the red dress. It was fine, it didn't matter that the colors didn't totally match.

Before I left to Catherine's she came back again. "You look really beautiful... You're mother is delighted with you, you knew it, didn't you? You knew she would be enchanted with it". No, of course not. I did not know how she would take it.

I stopped at the gas station. The dispatcher saw me as a lady, even after hearing my voice he thanked me and wished me a good evening, "miss".

I ate with Catherine's parents. Her mom cooked flautas and lentils. I sat at their table with the red dress and not once did they refer to me as Ivan. Her grandfather sat with us. He talked to me, he saw me, he made no mention. Did he recognize me?

We went to the university. I saw Felix and Ivan. I saw Brenda and Ivan Hernandez. Waiting for Jhonny, I hugged and congratulated Gabriela. Leo asked us to take a picture of him and his family. Nayely was the first one to see and say hi to me. Her friend saluted me with a kiss. Maybe he didn't recognize me. Maybe he did and didn't care.

Jhonny came out and I hugged him. "Woman!", he said to me. We took pictures. Ivan and felix and Tere and Sarahi, greeted me and hugged me as well. "Who is she?", asked her kid to Sarahi, "Her name is Sofia". Aymee saw me from far away and I noticed her eyes on me.

We went and greeted Zayra. She asked us how everything's going, how are we doing. She looked at me but made no mention nor comment of my attire or looks.

Walking back to the car, I see a bald man driving a green car. He was wearing shades but I noticed his eyes crossing mine. He turned but his face stayed on me. I recognized him when he finally exit. "Monica's dad"

We drove to Playas. We went to argana and was welcomed by new waitresses. They saw us as girls and brought us our moroccan tea and hookah.

Before Catherine got out of my car, we tried the lipsticks we bought. The wedding is close. The graduation party, the first party I'll go as Sofia is closer.

"Im tired.

That was not a quote. They were the first words I murmured before I started typing. It's an hour before midnight. Tomorrow will be jhonny's graduation. The dress is ready, the sandals are ready. I have more make up to apply. I won't be alone, Catherine will be by my side the whole night. This will be my first night as Sofia. No, I've had plenty of nights. I lived first by night and in hotel rooms. This will be my first party.

My nails are painted. I painted them today for the first time. The polish feels like a coat of plastic wrapped around my finger, pressing and pulling. It's a weird sensation. Even after all this weeks, I don't fully get accustomed to the idea of not hiding. I closed the door when I painted them. I exited the room with the face and clothes I showed to Rene. My parents were in the living room watching a movie. The've seen me, they know me, they love me.

It should not be unbelievable.

Last night Miguel came to my room and told me that he might need me to bring the television to his school. It would be in the morning, he'd need it by 10am. He'd send me a text message around nine if they would need it. If I would not hear of him by ten, he would not need the favor.

So I put the alarm clock at nine to be awaken and ready to his call. I kept waking and falling again on and on, postponing the alarm and answering Catherine's texts. I was nervous of getting the message or call. I wanted not to change or get up. I'd not have time enough to get ready to take it and then go to Rene after. I'd have to go in my pijamas. I just hoped he would not need me.

Fifteen minutes after ten, an arabic woman sang from my night table. I grabbed the phone nervously and looked the name of my Aunt Cruz in the screen. I answered but heard nothing. It might had been a pocket dial, maybe. Should I get nervous? As I showered later in the morning I imagined her telling me she got an offer to adopt both of the puppies. They'd prefer them to share a home. Best they not get separated. Who could I be to deny them that?

I made myself eggs with sausage and tomatoes. I shaved my pubes and used the other face of the razor machine to clean some of the subtle stubble of my chin and mustache. I put the jeggings and hesitated between the red and green blouse. I put the make up usually as I do. I took the brushes that I bought yesterday from Dax. I opened them and took the foundation one out. I did not use it. In the envelope it said it's for powder. I applied some concealer and blush. I looked at my face a little different. I looked different. Was it more feminine? Was it better? Worse? I could not tell. I just left.

I drove to Rene's. I parked the car in the plaza where I usually do. I walked to the building behind the hospital but made a stop in the Oxxo. As I passed the counter of cafe inside the market, one of the baristas said: "Can I offer you a drink, miss?" I walked ahead to the fridge and grabbed a bottle of water. I paid for them to the cashier that once complimented my hair.

"Hey, how are you?" "Fine, you?" "It's been a while since you've come" "Yeah, a while, I guess" "Yeah, good bye, have a good day".

She recognized me. But was I the young man she saw or the young woman that had been there?

"You've been going femme lately to Rene" Catherine replied to me as I told her by text.

My session with Rene was normal. I talked to him about Mexicali and the course. I talked about my wanting of a puppy and wish to care for others. I told him about my thoughts about never being a mother. The feelings that come with them.

Entering the building and at the bottom of the stairs was Brenda Zavala. She was with me in high school and then in college. Did I have her on Facebook? Did she know about me? We waved each other, anyway.

I went to Dax in the mall, I looked around in Sears looking out for something to wear on my hair. I found nothing. I bought a primer for eye shadow and the white eye liner that forgot yesterday.

Luis is not home. He's in school in his camp for the first night of the weekend.

I miss him a little.

### 2016-09-03

The day has come. The dress is hanged on my closet. The shoes are still in their box. My nails are painted but I'm still in my shorts and blouse. It's 20 minutes until 5 in the afternoon. In a little more than two hours Catherine is going to come. I feel tired and a strangeness in my stomach. I woke up early, not as early as Catherine, but before my mom and grandma. I got up and was the first one to open the paper bag that my father brought. I ate my biscuit and left the other one. Did I return to bed? No, I was on the couch. Is it nervousness or something else?

Before my mom and grandma left for school I did return to bed. I watched some episodes of Adventure time and heard them heading out. I returned outside with hunger. I looked for items to munch on. Early on I felt the pressure to fill this huge lacuna of time. Now, I see the minutes counting down.

I am nervous. I am a little worried of not being able to look nice. What if I end up looking weird? What if I look manly?

The reception card is inside my wallet. My father left to buy pizza. I ate at noon the other biscuit I left in the morning. I watched an episode of friends and told Catherine my intentions as if I were asking her permission.

I was again in bed when my mom and grandmom returned with Luis. They thought I was asleep, and Cande asked about me. "Has sofia eaten yet?" They argue a little if I were outside or not. "He was outside, he was here lying on the couch". His words do hurt. Why do I pretend they don't? I do understand, I know where they come from and the difficulty behind them, the struggle. But they don't hurt any less because of that comprehension.

"I did not see him", say my grandma after. As if seeing me as what I am not were contagious.

Will he still see me as Ivan, his son, when I shower and put make up on and wear the long dress? Does it hurt him as well?

He just arrived from buying the pizza. 10 minutes until five. When I asked Catherine the time that I should plan to start getting ready, she told me five. She plans on coming here by seven to help me with my hair. It's just arriving and saying hi, doing my hair, taking the manuals and her mother's feet bracelets and leaving.

What are the things that I have to do? I have to pluck my eyebrows, wash my teeth, eat, I guess, and maybe stopping by the bathroom. I have to shower and shave my pits and legs. I have to wash my hair and body. I'll shave my face after. I'll put the moisturizer on my face and then put the mousse on my hair and form the curls to let them dry until Catherine arrives. I might start with the make up. First, I'll try the eye shadows.

There is another anxiety. That is the new thing I don't really know how to do. I've seen videos on the internet, some tutorials and tips, but they're not really useful. I did it once, Aidee helped me, she was with me and saw me and guided me.

I should be going out and started eating.

What will happen tonight? After both of us get ready and go to the party, after they took our receptions and let us in, and show us our table. How will it be? I was nervous about seeing Tere and Ivan, or other graduates. But I've seen them already. They have seen me in a dress.

There is nothing new. I'll be me in a party. I've been me outside, I've been me in bars and restaurants and other places. I've been me with friends and family. What's the difference? Is it uncomfortable to realize there is nothing new?

There is something new. This is a graduation, this is a formal ceremony, a long dress night party. This is not a going out to bars, the first time of those was nervous and exciting as well. Now I don't need to worry about being asked for an id.

This time there won't be an after party. This time I won't sleep besides Catherine with a hungover.

This time I won't need to drown in alcohol to bare the suit. This time there is not going to be a suit. That is change enough.

### 2016-09-04

I feel this urge against writing the words. It's been 80 days of continuous writing. Why is this so tiring? Is it that I am running out of things to say? More than four months of hormones and changes, yesterday was the graduation of jhonny and my first evening in a long gown. It's not that I have nothing to say, just that I feel this defense against it.

seven hundred and fifty words, three pages approximately. The conversation with Catherine is in another tab. This morning as I returned home I considered sitting in my desk and typing this day's quota. I did not.

So I finished yesterday's words in the afternoon so I would not have to feel pressured about getting ready or returning home or finding the time to type them in the phone or cheat.

I got out of the shower with my body shaved smooth and my face ready. I put mouse on my hair and applied some cream in my face. I was nervous about starting with the eye shadow. It was something I just did once. This time I would be seen by several people. Time kept running and I started. It was difficult to find a place where I felt comfortable. I stood in front of the full mirror behind my door and then sat in my bed with the hand mirror Catherine gave me Thursday. I did them calmly and slowly. The end result was a subtle change. Even with the full make up, the difference was noticeable, but I looked natural. Catherine put it as "you look subtle, natural, like a good girl".

After the make up and hair I put on the shoes and finally the dress. The open leg looked better than I had imagined. The nervous of getting out came again. It's not about fearing the reactions or comments. It's about being seen, being exposed. I am vulnerable, I am true to myself.

I asked my mother to break me a note of 500. She did and made no comment about my face or clothes. It was until later that she asked me if the dress was from when I bought the other one for the wedding. "Yeah, for 20 dollars, too".

I looked for the tag and showed it to her. There were still some minutes until Catherine's arrival.

She sent me a text. She was here. I opened the door and received her. She helped me with my hair after greeting my mom in the couch. I went up for the container with my mom's hair pins. My dad saw me as well. Catherine tied the upper half of my hair in two meeting braids. She tied them with a hair pin that she lent me. Finally, she separated the curls and farmed them thinner. She started on my left side and when she got to the right, she kept the same orientation, changing the original one from the final side. The right side of my hair puffed up in frizzed as the curl was formed in the opposite side. She fixed her hair and I turned them as they were with some more mouse. I looked fine, although I felt a little nervous and uncomfortable.

We left to her car and she drove. I expected to see some known people besides Jhonny and Tere. There might be Ivan and Felix or someone else.

She turned around after we were in line waiting for a parking spot and the cars behind us started honking. The second time around the door of the parking place before the mall was open. We parked in the yard of the restaurant I went with my mother. Inside the salon, the first person we met was Melissa. Had I seen her since I told her about me? This was the first time apart from two days before that I saw a lot of people.

I was treated as a woman by every single person. The ones who recognized me hugged me and told me how happy they were to see me, the ones who don't, just looked through me. The waiter, as he realized that there would be a missing plate in the table, asked the man whose turn it was if he would like to cede it to me instead. He accepted.

I waited in line for the bathroom, not a single person looked at me judging or suspicious. I waited for my turn and used it. I was greeted by men with a kiss in the cheek.

Today, the boyfriend of Gabriela, Antonio, added me on Facebook, and sent me a message saying how we never really talked before, but he wanted to say to me how I looked really good and happy.

"It feels really different wearing a dress to a suit" "You look different, you look more happy... No, you just look happy"

### 2016-09-05

More than a 12 hours of sleep, a mid afternoon nap and I'm still tired.

My mom just came down to eat dinner and I took one of her burritos. A student of hers gave it to her. It's of potatoes and meat. In a mason jar I put some apple juice.

I'm chatting with Catherine on the other tab.

"are you feeling bad lately? Your grandma told me she's been seeing you tired lately and with a falling face or without energy, you're not eating lately"

I have been eating. I've eaten more than I should. But is she on to something? I was lying on bed by 10 last night. I fell asleep after some minutes. I had several dreams. I remembered them at the time. The were about nothing extraordinary, the same old wanderings through fantasy. I came and went several times in the morning, each opening of the eyes was futile and every turn or intent to getting up fruitless.

12 hours after falling asleep I answered Catherine's text and got up to eat breakfast. Candelaria was cleaning the lentils and putting the rice to cook. I decided not to use the stove and took the leftover biscuit from yesterday. I ate it in the couch while I looked for something to just hear on the tv.

If I keep trying to find things to narrate about the doings of today, I won't even get to half of the words when I'll be sick of this.

I saw the post I shared about the contest of the tales. Tales about sexuality. I posted it like a month ago and I've not even started the plotting of the draft. I had several ideas, I remember. Had I forgotten about it or just ignored it?

Months before that I wanted to design a research project about a state of the art of the knowledge of trans people in the education and health circles. I wanted to do surveys or even just interviews.

Even reading the threads in reddit about the transgender people has lost its interest. I remember being in Spain and looking at the messages and comments, people talking about the changes they were experimenting with hormones, a month, three, six... coming out to their family or going out, their procedures and surgery, their doubts and realizations.

I read them with longing and thought of them so far away from me. I never commented nor posted anything, be it a question or anything to share. Time passed, and with it, it went and returned. I dealt with it again since the very beginning and told my friends and my parents, I started with the blood tests and the meetings with the dr. I started the treatment and came out, I went out more and more femininely. I am full time, now. I go to the school and out of the city as Sofia, I meet my family as whom I really am and everyone treat me with respect and admiration.

I read the posts and even though I'm barely beginning I see them so far behind. Their problems are no longer mine. I have started HRT, I've told my family, I've gone out both in my job and my school and my social life. I have no doubts about who I am. I know how to keep in check the occasional feelings of self-hate and disgust with my own body. The changes in the short months I've been on hormones are notable and effective. I'm seen as a woman most of the time. I'm happy and people notices.

My life is not perfect, I am not done. I hate myself sometimes and feel the dread of the things to come and the sadness and frustration of what I can't overcome. I see my body and still see traces of that costume I grew so attached to. I can't let go of the rest of his clothes. I still think of the supposed friend who left. I still cringe when I hear my dad avoid pronouns and names, I still feel let down every time he lets the old name slip out.

Some days, like today, I can;t find the energy to get out of bed, or the will to do anything. I want to escape, be it in a children's cartoon or webcomics born from the fantasy of strangers. Even escaping to a half-read book is too much.

Something keeps me from trying, from starting long-term goals.

I am scared of leaving them unfinished. Of failing.

Maybe that's why continuing with this is more and more tiring.

### 2016-09-06

I'm in bed. I'm not as sick as a week or two ago, when I threw up, and had to cancel my going out with Catherine. I haven't cancelled anything. The symptoms started today. It was after waking up. I don't remember dreaming anything or getting up in the middle of the night. I can't remember most of the night. My father and mother were arguing outside, in te living room where the printer is. Some paper sheet must had gotten stuck in the tray. My mother asked for my father's help. His actions were not precise enough. She warned him he would end up breaking the thing. "I don't know what else to do. I don't know about any secure or level to move. If you do, show me, but I don't."

My mother told him, to stop messing with it carelessly, that's how 'they' broke the last one. She talks in this way when she asks for help. She and my grandma has this thinking of how someone who has more knowledge the them about technology, must know everything about it.

They don't seem able to comprehend how we get to know about it. It's not like we were born with it, or had this genetic disposition to get the functionality of stuff. It's that we're not afraid of the machines. We look around, move around and mess with it. We pressed the buttons and set the preferences and see what happens. We experiment and try a different learn. We started just like her, in front of the screen with an intention and a need. When she comes to me or Miguel to ask us how to set the paragraphs the way she wants them or to turn off certain alarm, we have the same knowledge as her. We hand her device and start as clueless. Slowly we move and try and search until we get it. Sometimes we can't, or we have not enough time or energy to stay trying. She gets mad. Why don't we help her? We know. It's as if we had her answer and kept it from her. How could we be so selfish?

Lately she has not come to me for help. When I remember those instances of compute assistance, I grouped her with my grandma. Edgar, my brothers and I are the ones to help them. Were it not for my father, I'd imagine I'd be a thing about age. Is it about gender?

Is that why she no longer asks me?

I had to get away from the tablet. I guessed it was supposed to be more comfortable writing in bed, yet I don't feel it. I saw something move in the pillow under my chest. A brown small dot, running away. It was a spider. Was I once afraid of them?

I killed it. I don't like them,i don't like the thought of them wandering around in my bed as I sleep.

In mexicali one of the times that I stayed a week with my grandma, I remember how I was scared of going to the bathroom at her place. I could pee just fine, but showering or shitting was unconceivable. There were lots of small black dots moving under the toilet. Would they crawl to my legs as I sat defenseless and vulnerable? What about in the shower, naked and with my eyes closed?

For six months I showered in Spain. There was no curtain but a plastic door that had magnetic latches. The shower head was a handle that could be placed in a mount over our heads or maneuver it with our hand. That was the shower Consuela and I shared.

I haven't heard from her since my coming out. She added me on Facebook and liked something, I guess. But there's not been any message either way. RaÃƒÂºl hasn't added me, either. He didn't use Facebook much. Alberto knew and added me the same day I posted it.

The sounds are crisper and more annoying. My nose is running. I ate two sandwiches and a cucumber and a bowl of lentils.

My mother asked me how I was feeling. I told her the truth. My father would go to the pharmacy, he could buy me some pills, antiinflamatories for my throat. I asked him for some antihistamines, as well. I'm running out of estrogen. I did not ask him for those. Yesterday my mother gave me money for therapy and another 500 for pills. I could buy them from there.

Tomorrow I'll see RenÃƒÂ©. I could go to the pharmacy after my session.

### 2016-09-07

It''s actually very early. My stomach is again twisted in a knot and I feel the food that I haven't really eaten stuck in my throat.

I need Catherine, I needed her more than ever, but she's not available. Maybe she left her phone charging, maybe she went to sleep. Would be able to tell her anyway?

Miguel respected my privacy. He knew since I was in Spain, or maybe even before,and said nothing. Maybe he came to the knowledge just as I did. No. None of them are like me... But he is, that's this whole deal.

I went to therapy. I talked with Rene about trivial stuff. "What has happened lately?" I mumbled in session. I had nothing in mind to talk about. We ended up focusing mostly on the bureaucratic procedure of changing my name and records in the university. In there I got nervous. He mentioned several times if it was possible for me to do the change before applying. It would be easier, he added, to get in as Sofia instead of changing the record later.

I felt pressured, by time, by the circumstances. Getting out I walked to the car and there was a person now in front of the speakers outside the oxxo. Another man was with a tray offering samples of milkshakes.

"Friend", he called me on the microphone as he faced me, " do yo fancy to try this milkshake?"

I could not hear the end of his calling. Was I a female or masculine friend? How did he look at me? I felt hit and insecure. I sensed several sights and walked with shame to my car. "Does he notice me? Does she? Are they going to say something?"

Sometimes this is hell.

I was home and Luis phone was in the coffee table. I was reading about the university and an article about the discrimination some people feel on campus...

Someone called, from Mexicali. I told Catherine. I did not want to get the phone. How would I answer? What would I say? I don't feel like doing this now. The phone stopped and then started up once again. I answered with a hello. The caller thought I was my mom. I didn't identify the voice. I feel sick even now. I said she was not around and asked who I was. I ignored the question and took the phone to my grandma.

The call has finished and she brought the phone back. It was my aunt Cande. She is still here by the door, asking me if I told the dr about hte pills I'm taking. No, they don't affect nothing of that.

I keep avoiding it. I wanted to come to the computer and typed and I can't. I can't. I thought about it over and over for an hour and now I can't even mention it.

I read the messages. I opened up his messenger and looked at his conversations. I know it's wrong, I know I did wrong. He hasn't talked with Anaid. I had just warmed a bowl of rice and beans in the microwave because I was hungry. I read how his conversation with her. He used friend and ambiguously ended the word with a @ symbol. I started to worry. He wrote in feminine once or twice. I lost my appetite and started to get sick. He mentioned once he feels depressed, he feels sad and unworthy. I could had left it there, I could had just used it as evidence that there is something with him and just tell my mom to take him to someone. But I didn't stop, I scrolled up and reached an ignored message. He's suffering, he's atheist, he's trans, a girl trapped in a man's body who doesn't believe in nothing and likes nobody. I could read the frustration and misery and hopelessness and recognized them...

I had seen those signs. I saw them and recognized them before. They scared me and worried me. I went to Rene and told him my fear. I tried to ignore them, I let them go. I came out and told everyone and he said no more. If he felt something he could say it, come to me. Nothing happened until today. How would I had responded had he spoken?

How can I support them?

What if they don't believe them? What if they blame me?

I can deal with this pain and suffering. I don't want them to go through this. Why am I so scared about this?

"3 ways you can know if you're falling for with someone" "How can you know if you're trans"

Yesterday I used all the free time in the night I got for doing the words early to worry about Luis. I thought a thousand things. What could happen, how serious everybody would take him, how serious should I take him? What could my parents say, how would my dad react?

I cried various times for several different reasons. I was drowning in my head, I was poisoned by the guilt. How could it be my fault? Would anyone attribute it to me?

The last message I sent Catherine was one asking her if she had fallen asleep. I heard the voices of Miguel and my grandma. He accepted just one of the burritos she made him. Then I heard Luis and everything came back. I doubted him how I never really doubted myself. "But he's so handsome, and seems so happy and fun"

There was a message from Catherine where she answered my last question from the night. "Yeah, and really early, too" She asked me if I wanted to talk about yesterday. She apologized for not being for me. I told her I did not know. I didn't. Did I want to talk about it? What would I want to say? I spent the whole afternoon of yesterday and almost all night repeating everything to myself. As if saying it so many times would make it less real.

Less than a percent of the population.

After a while of staying in bed and failing to get back to sleep, I got up and ate something. I had no appetite and no will to prepare something. I heated the burrito that was left and ate that. I lied on the couch and try to distract myself with Law and Order. Even my free time shows are about sexual deviants.

As the day passed I learned to be calmer about everything.

What has to happen will happen. I can't do anything. He'll come to me whenever he's ready. At his age I did not think about any of this. I lived my life as it was. He's young, he might be confused. He's having all this changes of his body and peers and relationships are something new. He doesn't even know if he likes anybody. He doesn't know what he likes.

And his message lights up like a fire ink on my mind. I'm an atheist, I don't believe in anything. I'm trans, I'm a girl in a man's body, I don't know what I like and I just want a daughter.

I should had recommended my mom to take him to a psychologist. Look someone up, maybe we could had avoided all of this...

But there is nothing yet to avoid. I came to know because I snooped where I shouldn't had. I remember the message of my mother ex-student. One of the twins. I thought about him when I came out to everybody. How would he take it? What I know of that person is real? Why does he keep his hair so short? how does he do it? How can he take it?

My mother, later when we talked about that day, she mentioned him. She cried because of the emotion and after what my grandma said and after reading HIS message in Facebook. He just added me but said nothing. Did he make a comment? I took notice of my mom's mention but thought and did nothing.

Until today. I thought about her phone and her ipad. I had looked Monica's profile from her Facebook. I could see the conversation, yeah, that's the reason why I'm in this mess in the first place, just like I found Miguel's stash of woman's underwear that other time I snooped around. I don't seem to learn. So I looked for her ipad in her room. It wasn't there and I went to Luis' for some reason. I grabbed his ipad and tried the password I know. It passed after a moment of uncertainty. A chrome tab appeared, in it there was a picture and text, it was a page of wiki how. How to know if you're falling for someone. It was... fitting. I thought of a coming to age sense of confusion and discovery. There were lots of tabs and I looked at the rest. Two were of the same subject. Other three were how to know if he were trans. Others were lists of baby girl names.

I told Catherine, but it wasn't like yesterday. He's young, he's twelve. Even if he were totally sure and my parents were totally supportive and he had the total backing of a therapist, he would not start on hormones. She?

They would start in hormone blockers... if. Until fifteen or sixteen would he start.

There is no rush. There is no pressure.

"You confused me as well, when everything came up" Catherine said.

She came and picked up my grandma's gifts to her mom.

I told her about Alan's suicide attempt, and when she answered, her voice broke. I asked her naively. "He was your best friend and tried to commit suicide... I thought when my best friend considered it, too"

Tomorrow I'll get the puppy. "She's really anxious to get her new owner".

In the morning I felt a shivering cold, and the freezing sweat of a feverish nightmare. I got up to the closet and brought down the thick cover. Do I remember my dreams? No, not really. I think I told Catherine a little about them. She and Miguel, her friend, and someone else, were in it with me. We were killing time before going to a party or a meeting or somewhere.

I got up with a burning ache in my throat. Just an hour ago did I return home.

"One like I don't notice" was the caption of the new profile picture of Omar Moncayo. The first comment was from Monica, that said she loved him to the moon and back. I rolled my eyes.

Getting up I was not hungry. I am anxious and worried about Luis' discovery. I had new messages from Catherine and Eusebio or the gang in the conversation, I don't recall. Catherine said she felt itchiness under the tape of the electrodes. She was uncomfortable. "Sofi, I was going to tell you if we do see us after they take the machine from me?"

What? Don't she want us to meet? That was the plan, we were going to see each other after she returned from the clinic and took half a shower.

"Do you mean if we see us after as in the afternoon or as in another day?" The minutes passed and she stayed silent. I rememberer my distaste to when she asks me a question and then goes away. Five minutes passed and I sent another message. "Now you don't answer."

"I don't know..."

20 minutes later she said I made her anxious. She hates cancelling, I know about it. She hates dealing with the permissions.

We talked about it and came to an agreement. We would see us after her return, her shower would be complete. Her time to be home was 10 o'clock.

I made myself breakfast. At first I just ate the burrito Miguel left and took my pills. I took out the ingredients from the fridge, some meat, half a tomato, some onion, sauce and two eggs. I prepared the pan and cut the stuff. When the eggs were ready I was no longer hungry. I ate the plate in steps an hour, maybe, later.

Something happen with her mother and a friend of hers. Her plans changed. She and her mother went together to the clinic. She'd take her to where her father was near the bus station. She'd be home later than planned. There was no problem. I was almost ready. Just some make up and I was done. My hair was done, my clothes were on me.

I grabbed the ipod and listened the podcast I downloaded yesterday. "Stealth mode, how to be a girl", it was narrated by a mom of a 6 year old transgender girl. She started with a day in the pool, somebody looked under the stall as she was changing her daughter. I was telling about it to Catherine when we were sitting in the pizzeria, bizzo pizzo, in playas. The peeking kid got the girl anxious. The mom talked about the burden of holding a secret like that.

Catherine almost cried when I got to the part when the mom talks about taking her to a new summer camp. She filled the registration form with her name and age and... gender: male or female? Should she tell them? She put Female. Must they know? Could she trust her daughter to deal with the situation if someone knew?

"Do you want me to tell one of the teachers about your girl penis?" The kid began to scream No. I could hear the desperation and fear in her voice. The mom calmed her down.

Catherine's eyes filled with tears.

We ate a pizza with pepperoni, ham, meat and chorizo both spanish and argentinian. Each of us ordered a craft beer. Mine was Tangerine IPA and hers was a chocolate Stout.

From there we went to the Dax in the plaza. I bought a little bottle of nail polish and a bigger one of acetone to remove the one already in mines. I drove towards Argana. We were welcomed as ladies and lied on one of our usual places. In Dax, I read the conversation of the gang. We talked about the dresses. Paola said hers don't fit. Jessica doesn't have one yet. Catherine's fit enough so she can't gain any weight. Mine is a little loose so I don't mind. Chevo posted "insert here a joke about me not having a dress either".

It was... weird. I was one of the girls. Paola posted how he could have one and added an emoji. It was a little uncomfortable.

In argana we talked about movies and relationships. We smoked and ate.

We stayed a couple of minutes in the park and continued our chat. Tomorrow we'll go to get the puppy. I am as nervous as I am excited.

### 2016-09-10

We're in Mexicali, I'm sitting in my uncle and aunt's couch. We saw the final of the woman's championship of tennis. A Czech and a German. After the match and the victory of the German, the adults went to buy food.

Luis woke me up in the morning, it was just a couple of minutes after 9. Was I going to go to Mexicali? Was I going to shower?

I showered and dressed. I'm wearing the denim shorts and the duck tailed blouse. I put my make up and did my hair. This is the first day of the weekend. I grabbed a carton box of Miguel's room and the oldest t-shirt I had in my closet, the brown one of pink Floyd.

We ate pizza and teriyaki with chicken.

Last night I could not sleep. Was it the excitement of today's trip? We need to buy milk. When I sent the message to Anahi about my puppy, Paola asked me if I had a bowl and a bed ready.

I was lying in bed with the lights out. I saw the unfinished episode of the anime I had started, Clannad. It's supposed to make everybody cry. I don't need anymore a reason to be sad and crying. I'm a depressed trans young woman, my baby brother is confused about his sexuality, too. It's been difficult to everybody in the family and now I'm the only one who knows about the signs, and now symptoms, of him.

After finishing the anime episode, there was a recommended video of "a Texan in Tokyo". In it an American woman married with a Japanese man talked about, uh, what was it ablut? The eight most expensive things in Japan.

Seeing the video, before playing it, I noticed some resemblance to Monica. The woman had a circular white face surrounding her eyes were big and enframed by dirty blond hair.

At first I just ignored it. Like a shooting thought that you miss in a blink. A while into it, there were some other things that brought black memories.

The way she laughed, or her high fake voice, or some facial gestures. It was impossible to ignore. Her smile was different, she had big teeth in a full smile, her eyes were blue and warm.

I liked her husband, too. He had a charismatic familiarity that brought me back to my time in a foreign country. I watched some of their videos, time passed and I closed the tablet by two and a half in the morning.

In my dreams, I visited Catherine in a hotel room. We were there, I don't remember if we did something. What I do recall is the walking out of the room and meeting the other dirty blonde from my past. She asked me to meet. Weren't you mad with me? Don't you have a boyfriend?

We ended up in a different room, she took her top off. Did we kiss? Why didn't I leave? She asked me how did we wanted to Fuck.

"like a wife"

"do you want me to be the wife or treat you as one? "

That should had brought me back to the reason why we don't even talk to each other... What did I expect to happen? I can't even perform in sexual relationship.

What happened that I left?

I went to a third different room, and some other things happened.

In other dreams I tried to escape from this building. The offices were rigged with explosives, opening the door made the bomb blow and kill all the people inside and the one who opened it. The exit had a similar rigg system. There were different lifts and there was a reason it was difficult.

The third dream I was in a different building, a certain expo of this new artifact that utilizing the brain waves let the user have telekinesis habilities.

They said how it was difficult at first, but concentrating and with time you could move a thing.

I put the diadema on my head and moved the first one easily. I learned to move several at the first time. It wasn't automatically or even easy, it was hard, but achievable.

Lastly, someone took the band from my head but I learned how to do it without the machine.

We're still here with my uncle. The cat came and lied besides my leg. Edgar came from school. I noticed the awkwardness of greeting. Should I extend my arm? Should we hug?

In an hour we'll go to get the dog.

### 2016-09-11

Nymeria is by my side. She's in the carton box sleeping peacefully over her red daisy flower cushion. I made the words in Mexicali, we were in my uncle and aunts house. I was nervous about being with them, being welcomed. Not that I would not be accepted in their home, but how would they do it? Would there be comments or questions? Would their kids say something or do something?

Nobody said nothing. Everything went fine. Diego and Aldo greeted me normally and made no face or comment about my clothes or appearance.

I had forgotten about the hearing ads in Spotify. Yesterday before leaving I unsubscribed from the premium account. Now, three of their ads are playing between songs.

I feel tired, I left the deed of finishing the words until almost midnight. We were already in my uncle's house, almost leaving to pick up the puppy, and I was still nervous. I would not feel calm until I had her in my arms and sensed her white fine fur. Had she grown? Would she recognize me and be comfortable with me grasp? How would I feel the way home if she cried as I take her away?

We got there and the person who opened the door for us was my uncle. I passed stealthily and a little anxious. Would he make a comment or a joke? I, even know, can't even imagine what he might think about me.

My aunt gave me the vaccine booklet with the date of the next appointment. In two weeks she'll be two months and I'll be five on hormones. She also gave me a spray for training her to potty and a bag of cookies and a half-full bag of puppy food.

She did not cry on the way home. She was sleeping and calm. She stayed in her box and made no sound all the trip.

In my room I place the carton box in the place I had reserved for her. I place if with the opening facing up. It was an hour after midnight and she was awake. We played a little and she pissed and pooped. I fell asleep an hour later, and another hour after that, the dog started crying but went back to a quiet sleep. In the dawn she cried again and I pulled her out of the box. She peed again. Later I would realize that she cried because she could not get out and had peed inside the box all over the t-shirts.

Today I picked Catherine from her house and she came with me to buy the things for her. The necklace, the pillow, some toys and the plate for food and water. I bought a mop and a bucket and the training mats. She took a picture of me with the dog on my lap. I know the one she referenced to. Catherine appears as a child with a very young MuÃƒÂ±eca in her lap.

It's weird being around Luis. I can feel his awkwardness and discomfort. I can't not look at his projecting despair. I see my past self in those eyes. And I want to help him just as I wish I could help the young me.

Even if he's like me. He's ages ahead. At his age, I wouldn't even dare to tell it to anyone, even say it out loud. He's more prepared than I ever was. He's not alone. He has me as a role and a guide. But would that be enough?

Yesterday, when we were on our way to Mexacali there was a conversation in the gang group's of Facebook. Did everyone have electricity and water home? There was a black out, apparently. It was all around Baja California. I knew about the march defending "family" that would take place all over different states of the country. I did not know Tijuana was going to be one of them.

It was a weird feeling. Even now I can't take it of. Thousands of people gathered and expressed their discomfort and repulsion towards the laws implemented to help the LGBT group.

Their basis is religious, some "morale". Even before realizing my own situation, I was against them. Why would they feel that way and ask for the abolishments of other's people's freedom?

Now, it's different. Now they want to take my rights away. Now they are marching so I can't adopt a kid with Catherine. They're marching so we can't get married.

Today I read how they marched so I won't be able to change my name and gender marker legally.

And, I guess until now, I never fully understood the meaning of being a "minority".



### 2016-09-12

"Sofia's is pretty"

Catherine stopped by Anahi's house after getting her hair cut to leave the reception for her parents' wedding. Anahi just sent us a picture of the dress she wore at her graduation. Her mother liked it and told her she could wear it for this saturday.

This was Nymeria's second night here. Just now she's in her flower cushion asleep. The internet says puppies usually sleep between 16 and 20 hours. At first I felt inept with her progress being housebroken. If I want her to keep being inside I'll have to successfully train her to hold her bladder and advice her need to go.

First I have the training mats, but she hasn't been using them. Yesterday and this morning she went on the newspaper besides it. Today I could move her a couple of times to the mat. I took her out twice.

At night I didn't get up. I waiting until just before sunrise to turn on the lights. She doesn't go and use the mat until I turn on the lights. My grandma was talking with Miguel. Later, after my mother left, I turned on the lights again and fed her for the first time in the day. I get this weird nervousness. As if I'm going to fail her. I have this fear that I'll mess up in some way and it will be her demise. If I can't take care of a puppy, how could I ever take care of some other form of life?

Are those people in the marches right?

No.

It's Monday. The start of the week. Again it was just my grandmother and me. Nymeria does make use of my time. I have a reason for getting up in the morning. I had not forgotten about Fernanda. She was my first patient as a psychologist. She'll be my first patient as Sofia. This is another layer of difficulty to an already complicated occasion. She studied psychology. She is Liliana's patient, maybe she already knows about me. I don't know.

I was scared and nervous. How could I reach her? What would I charge her? Must I called her? I sent Lilli a text asking her. She'd see her tomorrow.

I sent her a message. She answered almost immediately. She was just about to call me in the afternoon. Actually, she was driving home, could I wait for her? Of course.

She called me Sofy, after I answered her doubts. We agreed to meet us after her session tomorrow at 4. The day after I'll see Rene and talk about what I read and the feelings I don't really know if I've repressed or dealt with.

This started as a diary. No, it was just an exercise to practice my english and redaction skills. Then I used it as another tool to deal with my emotions and fears and thoughts. I started more than a year ago. I've writing almost daily. I went to Chevica's grad and started antidepressants, I started hormones. I told my mother and my family and the world. Lots of things have happened and they've been recorded here.

It came the use of recording the changes and transition I've been experiencing.

The tablet just made a sound. Did I receive an e-mail? Maybe it's a Facebook notification or just a new YouTube video.

What has happened with my body? I took a picture yesterday after Catherine asked me if I was naked. The cleavage shown by my blouse was impressive. I have changed. My face looks different enough. My body looks ambiguous.

My nails are back to their colorless nature. Maybe by the end of the weekend I'll paint them with the new and more obvious red tone.

Tomorrow I'll see my first patient, again. The day after I'll see Rene. The Saturday I'll meet Aidee to do my hair and make up, later I'll attend the so mentioned wedding. The week after I'll take Nymi to the vet, her next vaccination.

Both Catherine and my mother have called me her mom. Am I that? Does it feel right?

I was maybe four years old when a teacher started this game where we walked in a big circle and made pantomime. We acted as the different things she called. A dog, a police officer, a mom.

It was, hard. Something clicked and repulsed me. How could I act like a mom? I could be a dad, but not a mom. I was a boy.

And now, years later, I feel this heartache that I, actually, could never be a mom.

### 2016-09-13

I heard her screeches near three in the morning. I turned on the lights, did she have her belled collar? I can hear when she scratches how the little bell jingles. She moved and peed in the mat. I turned the lights off again hoping she returned and went to sleep. The next time I woke was a little after seven. This time she did not return to her bed. I was lying in mine and turned the lights hoping she'd return, but she didn't. I turned them again and stayed with her. Did I take her outside? It was cold. We returned. We stayed playing and doing stuff until she fell asleep a couple of hours later. I took the opportunity and caught some shut eye.

My grandma got down. She helped me take care of Nym. I really needed and appreciated her helping hand. I don't know how could I would had gotten ready if it wasn't for her. She helped me with training her. The little puppy stayed in my thighs on her back. I scratched her belly and her mouth was open. Her little legs moved almost at the same rythm my hands did. She fell asleep covered in the white piece of t-shirt I lend to her.

I took some pictures and posted them online, both in snapchat and Facebook. Nym is asleep in her flower bed. I had to scream at her because she's been playing with the mat. After it, she walked shyly to the bed and lied down. Did I scare her?

It's tiring doing the words. Maybe it's the lack of sleep, maybe it's all the bundled and bottled up emotions that I keep carrying since I discovered about Luis.

Today was supposed to be my first session as Sofia and tomorrow would be my therapy. I put her today so I could see her before my session. Rene sent me a text message in the evening asking me if he could see me the day after tomorrow in the evening because he'd be out of town tomorrow. Sure, what is a day more.

I was changed, I wore the burgundy pants and the new blouse I hadn't worn. A long sleeved, gray blouse. I put on my make up and took a picture so Catherine could confirm me that I looked fine.

The patient knows me. Lili sent me a voice message asking me to "give her a call". I did and she asked me about Fer. No, I went ahead of her. She wanted to asked me about the other patient she wants to give to me. Someone whom she's been seeing for a long time. She comes to her for months or a year and then goes off before returning the next time she's on a crisis. She wanted to ask me, come to me and see if I would be ok with seeing her, treating her. How would I take the idea?

She had asked me before. She kept referring to this patient as her and she. The last time she told me she was a transgender girl.
Today, she got to the theme: "she's other, she's changed so much... she, uh, she is a boy inside a girl's body, she's trans".

So, he is a trans guy. How old is he? Would he be ok with me treating him?

I agreed and accepted it, she would ask her patient this saturday? She'd call me later. We returned to the patient of today. She had told her, she could be seen "by Catherine or Ivan, now Sofia". She took it as something totally normal. How was I feeling? I told her at first I did feel some nervousness, but later I felt calm.

She asked me later, how would I feel easier? Did I want to tell her myself or she could talk about it before in their session. I said she could mention it and anything I could clarify later.

I was all dressed and with Nym outside. I came in to my bedroom to put on make up. Almost to the last minute I ate some burrito. I got in just in time to the office. They were both sitting in the waiting room.

The session flowed naturally. Time passed like a breeze. I applied both of the tests and we talked a little about her school life.

Tomorrow I might paint my nails. I will send the picture I saved to Aidee and set the time of our meeting. Tomorrow, Thursday I'll see Rene, Friday is free for now, and Saturday will be the wedding.

Time do passes really fast.

### 2016-09-14

It is tiring having Nymeria here. She's licking my toes and I feel her moistened warm tongue strokes. Just now I changed her beds.

In the afternoon, while we were outside in the living room, she liked to go into the couch, the place between the two of them where the phone is. The plastic box in which she came was in there with the newspaper. I brought it out and placed it near the couch. She lied in there most of the afternoon. It's hard for her to get into and out of it. It's possible, but she has to try. So I thought it was a better bed for the night than the cushion in which she doesn't even stays.

Now she's in my thighs liking herself. She's passed to pull the button from the flier of my pajama buttons. Does she know there is something in there?

Having it here is a way so I can work. I know here she won't go piss and I don't have to be turning and monitoring her. I put her down. She started scratching and growling. Maybe it's her way of asking me to leave. I love her. It's nice having someone who follows me and cries when I'm not here. She needs me and cares for me.

In the early morning, near 4, I turned on the lights and she took the opportunity to go and do her business. She at least uses the newspaper. When it was time to return to bed and turn the lights off, she didn't want to. I turned them anyway and she wandered for the room. Without its bell I tried to locate her with the faintest sound. I turned it again and noticed her besides my bed. It wasn't until I heard the newspaper shredding with her bit in the dark that I corralled her with the carton. She cried and moaned for half an hour until she fell asleep. In the morning I noticed how she had peed the flower.

Today would be a lazy day, without Rene's session and nothing to be ready for.

She's sleeping now. I might take the opportunity and lie down as well after I finish these. Catherine is in Playas, she just sent me a text message moments ago.

I have the test to grade and look about the labor outlets of my patient's choices. There is no report now.

I painted my nails. It was easier now than the first time. I put two layers on my hands. I took use of the time Nymeria fell asleep in her old new bed.

I received messages from Lili and Aidee, I had thought about sending the pictures to her. It looked like she read my mind.

Lili's was an audio, in it she asked me to tell her where was the group's chat. I answered her and send a message so she could see it. She would buy the Wechsler Scale for Children. I thought about applying it, I wouldn't mind. I'd actually like it. But there is a girl who specializes in children.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. I have a dog now, it's hard and tiring. It's rewarding, though. I saw my first patient as Sofia. I might see another one, who's trans as well. And, over all else, I read Luis' message and saw his internet search. I noticed his doubts and worries.

I shared them. They curse me now. I feel awkward with him and I hate this. I feel hypocritical about it. Why do I feel bothered when he, in my place, was so calm.

Tomorrow I'll talk about it. After that, it's just one day until the wedding. Friday something will happen. I don't know, maybe I will go out with the family, maybe Catherine will ask me to go with her friend and or cousin somewhere. Maybe I'll stay in bed. Who knows.

And then saturday, the so waited day. I'll see Aidee by one, as she agreed. 500 pesos will be what I'll be paying her. My mother said she wanted to go to the mass. I do, too. I am worried, though. Would the father mention this last march? Or these new laws about the homosexual marriage? Do I want him to say something? Do I look up to being antagonized as if I'd be validating or something?

I should be expecting the ceremony, seeing Anahi and Chevica and the Paolas and being with my family all dressed up and pretty.

I am pretty.

Yesterday was it? When my grandma made mention of what Edgar told her. "There is nothing to say..." "About?" "I saw her, she's beautiful, my niece, my little sister. She looks so pretty, there is no doubt, nothing to say"

I thought my fingers would look huge and ugly, but I like seeing the color on its tips or looking down to my toes and being surprised by the colorful of them.

Let's see if Rene makes a mention of them tomorrow.

### 2016-09-15

Nymeria is asleep in her box. I moved it next to my bed. She's peacefully lying besides the little fluffy dog that Luis owned when he was a baby.

She woke me up again in the dawn. Like a clockwork I turned the lights on by 4 in the morning, she used the light as an excuse to cry. I took her out and before I could think about it, she peed on the floor. I brought her outside and she pooped almost immediately. She's been doing her things outside. She's getting trained. Just once has she pooped inside since yesterday. The urine is harder to anticipate and, for her, to control.

When we returned she didn't want to stay in the box for much. As I turned the lights back off, she started crying. I let her and turned. She lasted way less than the night before. We didn't get up again until the morning. She did her business outside. It was 8 in the morning, I think.

Catherine did not go to english. She talked to me late yesternight. She asked me if I was asleep, later if I was angry.

It was a little frustrating not getting answers from the texts. I understood she was busy. Was those feelings jealousy? Or am I envious of the relationships she has?

We were in Playas when she was talking about going out with Vania and her lady friends. It would be a friends' night, no couples. I could not go. I am not her boyfriend, but I am her partner. It was weird, not being welcomed. I want to go out, meet her acquaintances. See if they notice me, if they clock me.

"Did you tell your friend about me?" She just took her to the bus station today. No. They didn't talk. They made no mention of the present. It's alright.

Today I would shower and go to my session. I could talk about Luis today. I made myself breakfast. My grandma left some chopped tortillas for me in the fridge. While I was distracted, Nym took her last shit inside the house. I ate breakfast and stayed in the couch for a while. Not much later, both Miguel and my grandma came down.

Miguel did not go to school. He had just one class today, but it was cancelled. When I returned from Rene, my father asked him, no, confirmed if he failed a subject. Yeah, chemistry. The regulation test wasn't what he expected. He will have to take it again. He was not angry, not explicitly. He was disbelieved, surprised, mostly disappointed.

I took opportunity the first time Nym felt asleep when my grandma put her the dress to go to the bathroom. The second time she was asleep after we took it from her I showered.

We took it off. It tired her. It was like something took all of her energy away. She didn't move, she stayed mostly in the same place. Not even when outside. It was like the flicking of a switch taking it off. She started jumping and turning and playing again. Maybe it was the heaviness of it, or the warmth and coziness.

I thought I could put it to her by night so she could use it to bed. Maybe this way she'll stay asleep most of the night.

I showered and changed. I like seeing my crimson red nails with clothes. They look different when I'm not wearing pajamas and my face look feminine.

I left home 20 minutes after four. I parked the car where I usually do and walked. The sun was unforgiving, but the shadows were cold and breezy.

I got to Rene's floor by the elevator. There were some people by the opened door. Two women, one looked like a patient and the other her therapist or something. The one client-looking saw me and kept quiet. When the other one turned to me, I explained I was going to see Rene. She let me in.

Just as I was seating down Rene called me by the phone and said he was on the Buena Vista ramp stuck in traffic. I waited half an hour for him. I didn't mind really. He apologized profusely when he came in, but, yeah, I did not care.

I talked about Mexicali and the marches and Luis and being a mother.

I passed by the pharmacy and bought the pills. The pharmacist referred to me as lady. I drove home and found Nymeria asleep.

"Was it hard?" I could not hear her. "What did you hear?... I asked you if it was hard for you, to paint your nails"

My grandma mentioned again what she said in the morning. "I told her that she needs to go to the laser. It looks a little" My mother confirmed it and I felt uncomfortable.

On its time. On its time.

### 2016-09-16

"Why don't you read Ivan's?"

Sometimes words do hurt. Sometimes they're harder than stones and sharper than daggers. They stab straight to the hearth and poison your insights with doubts and sorrow.

I woke up again just a couple of minutes past four. I don't know if I woke her up or she woke me. I took her outside and she did her business. We both woke up at 6 and again went outside, this time it was harder to return to sleep. I messaged Catherine and we talked for a while. An hour, maybe, later, I faded away and didn't open my eyes until a quarter to nine. I gave Nym food and exited again. I saw the paper bag from the Carl's jr and thought my father had brought us food. It was the bag from yesterday when they went to get it for us.

My nails are a dark red. I wore make up. I asked my father what would we do today. He said we'd go to the United States. Miguel was in the bathroom so I stayed with the dog. She fell asleep again and I took that opportunity to shower. I didn't shave my body. I shaved quickly my face. Just one pass, I didn't even lather with the bowl. When I came downstairs the flower cushion was empty. My grandma told me how when Nym woke up and didn't see me, she went straight to her bed.

I finished getting ready. The hair, the clothes, make up. My clothes were nothing special, jeans and a blouse. The blouse is old, it's the black one from the first couple of times that I bought clothes. I wore the thin cardigan I've carried so many times and wore so little.

My make up was natural but noticeable. There was no shadow. My lips were a subtle pink and my eyes just colored enough to be noticeable.

The dog stayed with my grandma. We crossed the border. There wasn't a long wait. It was almost the same amount of time that we stayed waiting in the secondary inspection. If it weren't because the first words of the officer were that he would send us to secondary inspection, I would had thought that it was because of the mismatch between my appearance and the picture in the visa.

We went to eat breakfast in Denny's. The waitress was nice. It was a mixture of speaking both english and spanish. There was no gendering. Luis is the only one who constantly refers and calls me accordingly.

The first one was Miguel. I don't remember when. "No, I told Ivan". He said it fast, his words passed like a shooting star. Even now I doubt if I heard him correctly. From the dinner we went to Best Buy. My mom and I stayed in the car. In there she proposed me of seeing one of her workmates. The one who sees her in the role of a mother, the one who was jealous of me being her daughter.

I told her it was alright.

From there, we went to target. I bought a wallet. Simpler, more casual than the one I have. I didn't bought any clothes, but I did get underwear. Catherine made the comment of how it was a little creepy that I still use the ones she gave me. I hadn't given it any thought.

I bought the puppy's shampoo and food. I bought her a collar and a long snake toy.

I accompanied my mom seeing the make up. She helped me pick a foundation.

Later, just moments before we'd leave. My dad and Luis and me were waiting for both Miguel and my mom. Luis was wandering around the purses area. He looked at the same one, and then the other. He checked the price and opened the zipper. I felt anxious and worried. I wanted him to get away from there. It wasn't because I don't accept it. It's not because I think it's bad. It's that I am scared. I am scared of him following my steps. I am scared of my parents reaction.

I asked him "will you take it?", pushing him, purposefully make him to get away. He challenged my bluff. He explained how he didn't think the price was worth. He took another one with more pockets and said he would take that one. He was going to tell my dad.

I ran away. I heard just the traces of the first words he said to him. I did not stay to hear their answer.

I did not see the purse in the cart. It wasn't relief what soaked me.

We went to many stores. Plaza bonita, two wal marts, Barnes and Noble. I bought a book light and a zen board. You write or draw with a water brush and the draw stays until the water evaporates. It's a reminder of the fugacity of life.

In the book store, it was the first big misnaming. My dad called me Ivan, but there was no sorriness or regret in his voice. It was sure and non-caring. Dismissive.

From there there were countless more mistakes. "Here you were born Ivan... Ivan Sofia" My grandma misgendered both my and my dog. "He follows him." "I'll put this here, son" and so many others. My mother did correct her. Did she notice my face?

Does she now sees the pain behind my understanding?

Tomorrow is the wedding, less than 24 hours from now.

I stepped on Nymeria's shit. I hope it will the first and last time. I don't know how I'll do it with the food. I don't know how I'll do with lots of things.

### 2016-09-17

Wedding.

### 2016-09-18

 Nymeria is right here by my side. She's confused because I went to get her food but haven't given it to her. Yesterday she only ate twice. Once in the morning and a second time in the late afternoon. We went to the wedding. I almost forgot to write those words. I am exhausted. I don't feel with energy enough to sit and write. I've been here for a couple of minutes now and I've gotten up twice. The first time I went for Nym's food. The second I got soda in my mason jar cup. I never really thought I would be drinking diet coke. When I was little I used to drink coke. It was sugary, sure, but I liked it. The taste of the diet one was weird. Then, when I grew, I stopped drinking soda altogether. Why is it that now I crave it?

Yesterday was the wedding and I didn't write the words. I was already in the church when I remembered that I would not have an opportunity to. I asked for Miguel's phone and cheated. I thought I could do twice of the quota today and I'd be alright. But this evening I wasn't even sure I could finish these.

I could fill this page up with yesterday's wedding. I went to Paola's, Aidee, house. I left here 20 minutes before 1. The clock just marked the hour when I was in the boulevard approaching the seminary. I heard the arabic song from my phone and saw her name in the screen. She told me she was a little busy and was going to take a shower. I could wait inside her home. It wouldn't take her more than 10 minutes.

She did my hair. We talked about several things, how was high school for her. Her latest dating encounters or potentials. She even made us wonder when would we ever imagine we both would be there, in her house, doing my hair and make up. How would Monica take it?

"What would your father say? 'You look pretty, Ivan'" There was no malicious intent in her words. They stung like the bite of a snake.

My father asked me before leaving the approximate time of my return. I estimated around three, maybe? We finished half an hour before 5. I returned home with a hurry. I asked them to be ready and dressed, and I'd just put on my dress and shoes and we'd leave.

We got to the ceremony just ten minutes late. It started early but we didn't miss much. I hated the priest and his words. It was weird being inside a church in my dress and make up. My grandmother kept glancing at me. "She looks so pretty"

I was looking at Catherine, two benches in front of us with the hopes of her turning and seeing me.

After the mass was over, everybody took pictures with the bride and groom. My mother asked me if I wanted a picture. I told her no.

It wasn't because I didn't want a picture or I did not like how I looked. I was afraid of their reactions after seeing me. How would they react?

After the church we went straight to the hall. We were some of the first people to arrive.

When we approach them and congratulate them, Cath's mother called me beautiful. She asked my grandma if she was Sofia's grannie.

The party at first was difficult. I didn't deal with the burden of wearing a suit but I was still alone. The waiters and photographers referred to me as female. It would be weird if they didn't though. How did my father took that the photographer asked her to be behind the other two ladies?

Luis sat with me at the second table. The first one to come with us was Anahi. She sat by my other side. Chevo Jessica and Paola were next. Vania came before them but left to say hi to some people. She greeted me and called me Sofia. Were she and Miguel surprised of how feminine I looked? When Miguel left after midnight he said good bye with a kiss.

Nymeria was here in my room by herself. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous or waiting for a mess.

The party ended by four. They gave them another two extra hours because of all the setbacks that happen. There were problems with the lights so the party was music-less for the first couple of hours. The dinner came late and was totally different of what they had ordered.

I felt a little excluded at first. I wished Catherine didn't have to be by other places. I needed her by my side. Anahi started being awkward and silent and Luis, although he tried, was a little uncomfortable with the grown up people.

After the first half, things started to get better. The music wasn't just the live band. We danced. Luis got up and danced, too. I stood with all the ladies to catch the bouquet and both Chevo and Luis went for the leg thingy.

Today Catherine told me how I could use a rolled newspaper to get her out of my feet when she'd bite me. The sound is what scares them. I took her advice just now. She squeak and went straight to her bed. Was she sad, scared? Did she want to play and just went straight to sleep? Does she hate me now?

The room was all clean but for a small spot of urine by the door. There were several marks of wet in the mat and a couple feces. She was clean, she was alright.

Why do I keep thinking she's going to die? Why am I afraid she'll leave me, too?

She lies quiet, rolled up over her blanket.

She woke me up like everyday but at 7 in the morning. I was awaken and already had eaten when my father went for the breakfast. Catherine told me she'd go to the United States and if I wanted to go with her. At first I thought about saying no. I would just spend money. I would spend gas. She offered me a ride. It would be a short evening. She'd just buy pants, and polos and shoes. She was tired. So am I.

I showered and told my parent separately.

My mother was showing the video she saw that made her wonder if she was wearing her earphones wrong. It was a video showing how the shure earphones are worn upside down. I explained her, was it friday?, that the earpods from her iphone don't work that way.

"Ivan told you" said my father.

No, Ivan is dead. Ivan never existed. Ivan was never real.

Why do those words sound so stupid to me?

I am "Ivan", I am their "son". I might be their daughter now, and I may be called Sofia, but legally, officially, I am their son Ivan.

We crossed the border and waiting in line. Is this the first time that I've waited to cross in these new crossing? I handed my visa card to the female officer. I didn't notice at first, but I gave it backwards to her. She turned it and saw me obviously different to the person in there. My hair is longer and different, my face is narrower and fairer. My eyes look bigger and my chin smaller.

Doesn't matter how I look, the officers will always see the male person named Ivan.

I have more information about the process of changing my birth certificate. I saved the picture. It states the procedure of verifying the residence in the capital.

I, still, have to return to the state and change the records with the new certificate and a voucher that states the procedure from the capital's civil records.

There is still time left. I still have lots of things to do before that. I have books to finish, patients to attend, formats to fill and applications to send, tests to answer and interviews to attend. Flights to make and waits to endure. Moving, looking for apartments. Lots and lots of things before even worrying about that.

We crossed and took the bus. The first stop was the Wal mart near Anahi's work and soon Catherine's. We looked for her shoes. I saw some too. At first I took a pair of sandals. Then I saw that the long boots were just 20 dollars. Some short boots were the same price. She tried two pair of shoes and I had five by my side.

I ended up taking the brown boots and a pair of jeggings. She bought the third pair and a black polo.

We went to Palomar Street, the Dickies that's besides Ross. When we entered she asked for ladies black trousers, and the saleswoman asked for whom.

She bought a pair and then we crossed the sidewalk to the McDonalds. She ordered two cheeseburgers and I a fancy one with guacamole. Hers was 6 dollars, mine was 10.

From there we went to the trolley and back home.

I had forgotten to feed Nymeria. When I left, Miguel told me that Luis was in the bathroom, he was showering because he'd be going with me or something. After leaving target, I felt bad for him. I put myself in his shoes and felt rejected and left behind. I keep projecting myself in him.

Yesterday in his words, I caught a glimpse of his doubts if he loves her or just likes her as a friend.

Huh, I did finish twice of the quota. At least I have a reason to not feel bad about something.

### 2016-09-19

Half of the test is scored. The scores are all put into the table, just the sums are left. Nymeria is here by my feet.

"You're fine there, daughter"

She's alright. The spots on her crotch and back are just irritation cause by the lack of her mother baths. I took her to the bed. Just now she left the room and went to the kitchen. She peed just inches out of the mat. I used the newspaper when she started to bite it. She barked at me with her cute puppy screams. I went for her and brought her her. Will she stay by my side?

She woke me up twice this night. Once by three in the morning and another by six. I have a notification of Chevo's conversation. He must have sent a meme.

I like seeing Nymeria play. Move the little giraffe that Cathy gave her with her jaw.

Last night, there was a storm. When I took her out after midnight, I could see the lightning as we got back inside.

I dreamt things, but I can't remember. They mustn't had been important.

Today is Catherine's first day of her first job. She got up in the early morning and went to cross the border. She sent me pictures with the uniform she bought yesterday with me. I got up and ate breakfast. First it was a burrito left behind by my mother and brothers, then I heated the biscuit fro yesterday. I took my pills. Tomorrow is the last day before the estrogen break. The day after I'll be turning 5 months on hormones. My fifth month. I keep seeing the pictures of the wedding. I waited for that day for so long. I wore the long dress I bought with Catherine, I wore my hair styled by Aidee and the face she lend me.

I'm standing there, as the woman I am.

Tomorrow I'll see Fernanda again. I tried to finish interpreting her test, but with Nymeria is hard to concentrate.

I told her I would do research about the job market of her options, but I didn't. Am I a lousy psych?

I showered and got ready for the vet. I knew today was the day I had to take her to the second vaccine. I didn't really wanted to. What was I afraid of? That they would ask for my name? Talk to me as a man, or a freak?

I put her in a box after I dressed and drove to where I remember seeing the vet place. There were no issues. I got to the reception and a nurse welcomed me with a smile. She asked me to sign in their sheet while she made faces and caresses to Nymeria. She was still a little sick from the drive. They would call me, so I sat with the carton box on my lap.

Right now she's sitting besides my feet and licking my heel. I feel her warm fur on the side of my foot.

I saw a man in scrubs having difficulty reading the handwriting and sensed it was my turn. "Ny...Nymia? Sofia Fernandez?" He called and I stood up. He weighted her and asked me how everything was. I answered his question and made him some of my own. He asked me to hold her while he applied the injection. I felt what I imagined my parents dealt with when I cried before a shot. Her high cry made my hairs stood up and sent a shiver down my spine.

She's stopped licking and is now resting.

Tomorrow I'll have my patient and the next day my session. I asked Catherine to go to Argana, the beach. She said yes and we were both excited for a while. I saw her yesterday and I already miss her. I want to hug her and feel her cheek with my lips, and the tip of her fingers sliding by the skin of my neck.

I am a little tired and nervous. How should I close tomorrow? Will it be the last session with Fer? Will Liliana say something about the patient she would send my way? Should I mention the one my mother might send me? What if she denies me seeing her? At first I said I would not give therapy. Although she asked me if I'd dare to give therapy to english speaking patients.

Jhonny asked me when could we see him. This friday will be his show. Catherine told me she would contact him herself tomorrow after she checks her schedule.

She had to cancel our plans for wednesday. It's Vania's birthday. It's the dinner at which I am not invited. It hurt a little more because of that.

### 2016-09-20

Nymeris is right here by my side. She's so small, like a little rat, indeed. I remember seeing MuÃƒÂ±eca as a little dog. Today that I entered Catherine's house and was received by her, she seemed huge, almost enormous. I guess I've grown accustomed to the petite figure of Nymeria's body.

Today I received a friend request from Alejandra Olachea. She was with us in high school. Us? Who am I referring with us?

Alejandra's house was the hosting place of the last holiday party. In there Benny talked about me and Monica. In there Omar and Roger slept and Ian threw up and they called his father to pick him up. I went to that party. I had long hair and was thin as a stick. I apper in pictures as a skinny young man with long curls and a melancholic smile. Monica was in that party as well.

Alejandra got into Psychology as well. Was she in our group in first semester? She wasn't around by the second one.

I recognized her from the second I saw her name besides the picture. She was the one who told Monica were I was the first day of classes when she visited me in the faculty. "Oh, you're looking for your boyfriend?"

Later she sent me a text saying "Chulisima, how have you been? Did you finish school?" I didn't know what to answer. Why was I uncomfortable?

Yesterday I had plans with Catherine of going this wednesday to Argana, later she remembered how it was Vania's birthday. We cancelled.

Late at night, I received a message from Fernanda cancelling today's session. She is already in collage, she picked Communication. I sent Catherine a text saying my session was cancelled so maybe we could go today, meet up. She agreed. The plan was that she'd shower after getting home and I'd pick her up. We'd drive to the beach and smoke shisha and drink tea hearing the rain outside.

Nymeria got me up in the breaking dawn and then the early morning. She was asleep by eight and didn't eat until nine. The morning was as lazy as they come. I made myself breakfast. The sound of the rain set this atmosphere of coziness and rest.

I showered in the early afternoon. Catherine didn't answer back until after 2 when she got out of her job. The rain didn't stop. I was already changed. I wore the red leggings and new boots with the long blouse. As she told me she was on her way home I put on my make up. I felt pretty. Even in the morning as I got out of bed, I saw my reflection and smiled. I can see the differences that mark the time between my beginning of treatment and now. My shoulders are narrower and my arms thinner. My breasts are fuller and my skin paler. My face looks warm and delicate. I can see emotion in my eyes.

It was a gut punch when Catherine sent me an audio asking me if here the rain never stopped. There was lots of traffic and her way home seemed infinite. Maybe it wasn't a good idea going out today. The way to the beach is long, the freeway always gets inundated when it rains. Lately I've become more affected by driving.

I could see myself all dressed and made up lying in the couch. I'd be staying here, home, again. I felt little droplets of water forming in the corner of my eye.

I didn't give up and proposed her to go somewhere else. It was a good idea to cancel the trip to the beach, but maybe somewhere closer? We could go to eat something or maybe the movies. I wanted to see her, I wanted to be seen.

She told me finally if I wanted to watch a movie in her house. Her house is now almost empty, just a friend of her mother. I agreed. We could eat there. Anyway, I prepared myself a burrito of meat with potatoes of yesterday and went.

Her mother introduced me as a little friend of Catherine. "Sofia" I introduced myself. Her friend prepared chicken a la poblana.

It was the meal they were supposed to serve in the wedding. I saw them as they cut the chiles and onions. I saw the chicken before being shredded. When they asked for the sour cream and the cheese I knew the dinner would be a little awkward.

We watched Lilo & Stitch. When I got home, neither my mom nor her dad had arrived.

Rene confirmed our session of tomorrow by 1.

Do I have something to talk about?

### 2016-09-21

"Are you angry with me?"

Is this anger what I am feeling? I was irritated, I was angry with Nymeria when she kept peeing and pooping everywhere in the house, when I called for her and she ignored me. I felt anger when I was at the crossing border and the policeman went to the parked cars and left the lights in manual mode. I was disappointed when I had to tell jhonny that I wouldn't be going to his show.

He was really understanding, he told me not to worry. He said he loves me and maybe we could go out later.

Why didn't I want to talk with Catherine when I answered her back that I felt awful?

In session I spoke about the latest occurrences. I talked about going yesterday to Catherine's and the wedding last saturday and going both times to the United States. Being with Catherine and being with my family. The time that Luis asked for a purse and when my dad addressed to me in a forgotten name.

Today is the day of rest. Could it be that? Just five times have I rested from the pills. Or is it four?

I have been five months on them. My face looks a bit feminine even without make up.

Nymeria is by my feet. Just moments ago she saw me cry for the first time? Does she understand what happened? Dogs can detect when people are happy and angry. Does she recognize sadness?

I had her here on my lap when I started the words. She growled for some reason and I put her down. In the evening after returning from Rene I sat with my legs crossed on the floor and she climbed my legs to lie on my thighs. Her head rested and her eyes closed. Her tongue is warm. She rests now, with her head on the other leg.

Does she love me? She recognizes me. Her behaviour changes when I am around. Does she like me?

In half an hour I'll feed her again. Is that why she's grown accustomed to me? Is her love conditional? Isn't anyone's?

I feel this huge gray mist of sorrow over my body. It's heavy and cloudy. I can't see, I can't hear, every move cost me tons of energy. I want to lie down and just cry. I did for a fraction of the day. What is that I think about?

Catherine cancelled friday's plans. It's not her fault. It will be her great aunt's funeral. Her shifts are open-ended. She doesn't know when can they end.

"Do we meet him tomorrow?" She asked me about jhonny. "Don't ask me, just tell me. I am the one who doesn't have a life"

Is that how I feel? Yesterday I had no patient. I have no other one next. I have no job. My outs are with Catherine and that's it. I am shut in this home. Everyone, every single person of the group has a job. Anahi has had hers from years. Chevo and Jessica got theirs even before finishing school. Paola has had many to support both her and her child. Paola found one. And Catherine now talks about going to work and being tired and her shifts. She posted the image of her cap on the group and everyone congratulated her.

I wanted her to have the job. Why do I feel this way? What is it, is it envy?

I could apply to jobs, look for one.

But I don't. I don't send resumes nor search for openings. I haven't even redacted a curriculum. I am scared. I am afraid of filling it. I don't want to face the doubt of picking a name to put on top.

With what face will I face the potential employer, with what name will I introduce myself, with which voice?

I've been rejected and ignored when there was no sign of being trans on my resume. What can I expect from now?

Nymeri has fallen asleep. She scratched my leg and upped her eyes. I picked her up waiting for her to throw a bite. She just accommodated herself and let her conscious go.

Just fifteen minutes until I wake her up and give her food.

Catherine answered my denial of anger saying Vania is. She did not go to her meeting. It's her birthday. She got sick, she has the flu. She got soaked yesterday and had the premonition about getting sick.

None of us had continued the conversation. Anahi didn't reply about her proposal of going to Las Vegas on New Year's.

### 2016-09-22

I feel different. The cloud seems familiar, but there is something peculiar, odd. It's not like I'm used to.

I remember this feeling of just wanting to shut off. Lie down and plug out. Ask for a free time, a pause of life. I'm exhausted and embarrassed because I've done absolutely nothing.

Catherine is right, I did avoid her. All of yesterday I did not talk to her. She did talk to me, she told me how she had the flu and did not went to Vania's reuning. Today was mostly silence. The day started abruptly. Is there a reason why I mostly don't remember my dreams?

Nymeria didn't wake me for most of the night. I was the one who turned the lights and it was already morning. It was the biggest spot of pee she has ever done. I have her again on my legs. After getting up at eight, we went to the living room. I didn't have the energy nor the motivation to make myself breakfast. I stayed in the couch and she lied on her flower bed. She was calm and sleepy. My grandma stepped down an hour later and prepared something.

That was the high of my day. I did not talk with Catherine nor anyone. She asked me last night if I was asleep, but she didn't answer. I returned the question and she replied at dawn. Nymeria has fallen asleep again. Does she like being with me? I love having her like this.

For a time I had her over my legs on the couch as well. I even took a picture and posted it on Facebook. It has like 30 likes now. Even Yadira liked it. Yadira does know about me. Should I send Zayra the email? Why?

Yesterday my emotional concern was my lack of life, my void in actual goals or purpose of life. It seems like I'm in a limbo, stuck in a stand-by mode until the next year. We are almost ending September. Three months and it's gone. In two months the application process will be open. It's not that much.

Gilda posted something in the group. She has a potential patient who is in a grieving process. I could treat her, I could attend her. Why didn't I replied? Iris is the one whose job is to give therapy.

Nymeria almost fell down. She slipped her paw and fell from the chair, did she grasped the carton barricade that I placed in front of the desk's leg opening or was I the one who caught her on time. She was alert for a while, but she let herself down again. How does she trust me? Not even I trust myself.

There was a posting in the faculty group. Yolanda's still looking for an assistant. Someone to watch her reception and tell her when a patient arrives. I wouldn't even be answering phones, she does that herself. I saw it, and remember months ago how I said to myself that the next time she post it, I would call. I don't feel like it. It's not even a full day that I wanted something to do and now that the opportunity arose I don't have the courage to call. I don't know, no... I do know how. I just don't dare to call and introduce myself. Which voice is my own? Which one is my name? Yolanda, kind of, knows about me. It's more probable of being welcomed by her than a stranger.

I am afraid. I don't know what to do. I know what but not how. I know how but just don't have the courage to do it.

And so I waited on the couch, hating myself. I feel the same urges to cry and the self-pity, and I look for the same kind of articles that call for the known commenters who feel the need of stating their opinion about people like me.

I showered Nymeria. I saw her all wet and vulnerable and tiny. She trembled covered in the towel my mother used to cover me as a baby. I held her tiny body in my arms and dried her delicately.

I did my laundry. I got her outside again so she gets used again to doing her stuff outside.

Catherine had a job meeting this afternoon. The conversations in the groups flowed, but ours were stale. There was a silence between us that was broken with a snap from Anahi's account. Will we talk again tonight?

Do I want to talk? Will it help?

I feel like I've made myself this question thousands of time before. Why can't I remember its answer?

### 2016-09-23

I had another opportunity to call Yolanda and ask about the position. This morning I could sleep more than usual. Nymeria didn't wake up until 5 in the morning. Once again at 8, when it was time for her to eat. This time it was different. After her meal and me putting her on the mat, I brought her again to her box and both of us returned to sleep.

She's by my feet now, licking my heel. I should feed her again. It's time. Have I been writing my words earlier?

Again Catherine and I didn't talk until after her shift was over. I don't remember much about the morning. I ate one burrito that was left by somebody as breakfast. I lied mostly in the couch, with nymeria either by my side or over my legs.

I have a strange aching in my lower back. Even reaching a fourth of today's quota is hard. The rain has stopped. The clouds have dissipated. Days are bright again but my mood is still shitty. Not as shitty as before. Did I take my hormones?

Yeah. I had to check.

Tomorrow is the last day of resting. Five months.

My mother hasn't arrived. Luis told me yesterday he had a party. I would not see him until after 10 in the evening.

I read it about in his messages. This time it was from his ipod. I should not snoop. It's wrong. It's not my right. My worry is not an excuse nor a reason. In there I could see it's not over. He referred to himself in feminine and talked about the return of "Leslie" (?). It was a female name starting with L. More than 60% of gender non-conforming kids get over their gender dysphoria by puberty. He is starting his. Does it mean it will be over?

Paola S sent a message saying it was really short-notice. But their friends organized her a gathering in a house near the cacho area. We were invited. It's the first time she invites me, and the gang, I guess, to her birthday party. I read the message and thought how I did want to go. I don't care that there will be strangers. Even the idea of people realizing I'm trans or hearing my non-convincing voice does not dissuade me. The thing that made me unsure was that I don't really know if Chevo and Jessica will go, Catherine and Anahi both work and Anahi is not even in the chat group. So, would I be alone? Being all by myself and surrounded by strangers is another whole thing.

By that time Catherine answered back. She wasn't sure either. Paola A sent another message to the group of the four of us, asking if we wanted to go to a pre-coup.

I'll take the dog outside in case she wants to shit.

She didn't. She just peed a little.

Catherine said she preferred the idea of going with Paola. I don't know what I could wear. Maybe not a dress. Something more casual.

And Nymeria just peed, again, in the mat. Or is she just sitting?

Today she climbed the stairs to the second floor. When I called her to come to the mat in the living room, she would bark and then lie down.

I put the dress on her and she's lying on the mat again, crying . I put her on my legs. Do I do it for her or for me?

Catherine answered my texts about how I feel shitty about the thing with Yolanda. She knows or imagines how I feel. It's frustrating knowing my name is not the one on all my documents. How the person who I am legally has almost nothing to do with the one I am on the inside and outside.

Catherine sent me a picture that I had seen before:

Someone graduated at 22 and got a job at 27; another one graduated at 27 and already had a job. There is somebody who is still single and has a child. Some, married, had to wait 10 years until being parents. There are who have a partner and love another, and there are who are lovers but nothing else, and others who are still looking for love. All works according to our personal clock. People can only live by their own rhythm. It might look like your friends are ahead of you, or behind; but they are in their moment and you in yours. Live with patience, be strong and believe in yourself. It's not late, you are not early. You are on your time.

### 2016-09-24

The 100th day came without notice. I didn't realize until today that I turned on the computer and saw the number. Was the last longest streak almost 200 or 300?

Today Nymeria woke me up again but nor as early as before. I turned on the lights and saw that it was 5 in the morning. I decided against taking her outside and instead guided her to the training mat. Both of us returned to sleep and and get up until eight in the morning, time to feed her. After her meal I convinced to, again, come back to sleep. I heard my grandma chat with Miguel. He was going somewhere today. A course or conference or something like that.

I woke up by 10. Yesterday was the plan of going to Paola S meeting. Paola a invited us to a gathering before. At the final moment it was cancelled because her parents wouldn't be able to babysit her son. Catherine would be returning by the beginning of the actual party, so we decided to see us Sunday I instead. Another cancelled plans.

It was a suckerpunch to resize when I got out of my room that my father and Luis had gone to the United States. They usually wake me up and ask me if I want to go, if I'll shower. This time I asked my mom and she told me. Was it on purpose? Did my father preferred to avoid the awkwardness and possibility of being questioned about my appearance and situation?

I was left behind. Another day without a reason to get out of the house. I felt lonelier than ever.

Paola asked us to confirm and I had to cancel, again, just like I did with jhonny's show. Chevo and Jessica were going and I considered changing my mind. No, I felt awful. All day I've been meaning to cry and just wanting g to hide under the sheets and let the days pass.

My mother said my father was coming and he'd be bringing tacos from the taco bell. He doesn't know how to order for me. He always take the chance about mocking how he ways has to change the order of my food. I hate not being able to eat cheese. I hate not being as normal as he wishes.

I denied the breakfast my grandmother prepared. I went to shower thinking that I hadn't since Wednesday. Did I cry in the shower? It was yesterday that I fell to the floor in sorry a bawled my eyes while Nymeria sniffed the backyard.

Today it was in my bed. I didn't care about Catherine's and the experts advice and brought Nymeria to my bed while I was overflowed with emotion. At first she stayed calm between my arm and body. Then she started nibbling the skin of my hand and forearm. Lastly, when she bit my nipped I took her down.

I slept in the afternoon for like an hour. Catherine had ready returned. She sent me an audio.

"I'm worried about you, Sofi. I don't know how to help you, what to say. And the things surrounding you don't seem to help you either."

Yesterday I looked a video of The School of Life. It was called her with to help the ones we love. It talked about the frustration of jot knowing what to do to ease the pain of our partners. We approach them with the estrategy of what would help us, a d when it's fruitless, we end up feeling resented and frustrated. It talked about the different possible approaches. To some it's a listening ear what they need. Others prefer practical solutions or ideas. To some it's a reassuring optimism and "everything will be right" that helps them. To others, it's a pessimistic understanding that is taken as companionship in their situation.

What is it that I need? What would help me? What am I expecting of her?

I understand, kind of, what is it that bothers me. My dad called me Ivan three times to get my attention and give me the money of the week. I didn't dare to say anything or correct him. I took his money and left with the feeling that he gave it to me as compensation of his denial. A bribe or conditioned help that would stop the moment I break the bubble.

I feel trapped home, isolated. I feel trapped in my own unability to make the call or redact the new curriculum. How can I introduce myself as Sofia when it's not really true? It is not official yet. And again, I am trapped in time. Until I get out of here I can't do anything to escape my life as Ivan.

Today came a man giving the yellow section, the phone book. He asked for my name and I gave it to him. I introduced myself as Sofia FernÃƒÂ¡ndez without hesitation, without caring that I had no make up or my hair tied up or I was wearing man's pajama bottoms.

I said it as if it were true, official. Late tonight I finished the registration of the emergency app.

Will I surpass this self entrapment that I reside in now?

Is hope a bad idea?



### 2016-09-25

I really am trying not to cry. I am doing my best.

Why does it seem like everything got in motion exactly with the intention to make me feel shitty. She asked me yesterday if I wanted to go out. We could had gone out yesterday and I could had seen her, and I wouldn't be crying right now. I hate she has not signal or way of communicating with me. Just yesterday I told her that it was legal for her to have an open-ended shift. She doesn't know if she'll work four or the complete hours.

Yesterday she asked me...

I am going for the roll of paper. I can't contain the tears. I feel so miserable and weak. I feel like an idiot. I am so alone.

I said that I preferred seeing her today, that I could see her more. We could use the time. Nymeria keeps coming out of her box and biting the linning of my bed. I put her in there again. The first time it was just grabbing her and putting her down. The second time it was with force. The third I wanted to throw her.

I feel anger. I am angry but it's not at her. She might be desperate right now, thinking about me.

Why did I just throw away my phone? Why do I feel this way?

It's just another day that I'll be in the house. Another plans that got cancelled. It's four o'clock. She might come by 5 or 6 and we might go out anyway. Would I go? I haven't eaten and I don't want to. I think about telling her no. Wallow in my own misery, go to bed and change into pajamas and just cry my eyes out until I don't feel no more.

It's been almost since hours until the start of her shift. Two more hours and she will absolutely be out. They won't put her on overtime. But what if she's too tired? What if she has to return early? Why do I still feel like such an idiot? There's no way I could had known. Maybe it's best to postpone it until tomorrow. See her all day. Maybe she doesn't want to.

I feel like tuesday, when it was raining. We were supposed to go out and, as today, I showered and got ready. She returned from the United States and we talked about where would we meet or how could we do it. But it was out of our hands. The weather was horrible, the rain didn't stop, everything was filled with traffic. We would be returning late and it'd be dangerous.

And I felt something like this, a pain similar to the one that envelops me right now. I was all dressed up and ready. I wanted to go out, to get out of the house, feel like I do something, I have a life. And it was cancelled. I begged her, I proposed other ideas, maybe other places, somewhere closer. Please, anything.

She answered back and told me we could see a movie by her house. I took it like a homeless person accepts a roll of stale bread. Then, the next day I went to therapy, and since then I've been living in my own personal hell. I am trapped in this house. My father keeps calling me Ivan. I am drowning in here, I have no job, no goals, nothing. I have friends but I can't talk to them. I don't know how to approach them, what to say.

I saw yesterday's messages. She got out early and told me how she didn't had any signal and was waiting for the bus. It was three in the evening. Five hours after her in time.

I saw them and sent her some messages thinking she would answer them at any time. When I showered and changed, purposefully I didn't apply any make up. I put it on by three, thinking she could get out at any moment and I wanted to be ready, not lose any time.

I asked Anahi if she knew if Catherine was out already. The cellphone vibrated several times continuously. I, foolishly, thought how it might be a coincidence and Catherine just finally got signal. I was wrong. Anahi told me she got out by 1 in the afternoon and Catherine was still there. It was really busy because lots of people skipped. She didn't know if they'd make her work her full shift. In three minutes it's going to be 6 hours since she got in.

I don't know what I'm feeling. I am sad and angry and frustrated. I want to throw things and scream and keep crying. I don't know if I should finish cleaning up the make up that survived my tears or changed resignated into other clothes.

I think about sending her another text message, one telling her to contact me as soon as she cans, as if it would help in anyway to get out.

She does love me. She probably feels awful right now. She doesn't need my help to share this pain.

### 2016-09-26

I am home. Today I did go out. Catherine picked me up by 2, just like she said yesterday after coming from her job.

She send me a message after 5, closer to 6. In it she told me she was in San Ysidro but her phone was running out of battery, we would talk when she got home.

I sent her an audio later when I told her that I was going to ask her to come home, even if it were for a couple of minutes, just to see her, to hug her. I wanted to cry on her shoulder.The second one was for me to realize that she would not hear them until getting home, so not to bother to come. I understood.

When she got home, she said she felt she wanted to explode, she felt awful. She screamed to her mother when she asked about her time of arriving. She felt like crying. I said I had been crying all afternoon.

When she got home I decided to clean my face and then to change clothes. She told me her schedule for the next week. She'll work tuesday and Thursday. She wanted to make plans. I wanted to see her, but I was afraid of planning something to be cancelled.

Would I want to go somewhere? I wanted to be swallowed by my bed.

She change her mind and just told me. Tomorrow I'll be going to get my results, be ready and I'll pick you up by 2.

I wish I could be that direct and asertive. I can't, I wouldn't be able because she has plans and things to do. I don't.

And so I got up today in the morning. Nymeria is waking up later each day. This time she did not made a sound all night and just woke me up by 5.

I ate breakfast. My grandmother did two burritos for me and was preparing her own meal. She used the already heated pan to reheat them. We ate together. Nymeria had just eaten hers.

In the morning I did nothing. Catherine told me to start getting ready by noon. And so I did.

I showered and shaved both my legs and chest. I shaved again my face but just one pass. I did my hair and applied make up. Catherine told me not to wear pants but a dress. The white one would be perfect. She came and picked me up. Just in time after I gave Nymeria her food. We were playing in the living room with my grandma.

First we went to the building next to Rene's. There she picked up the results of her halter test. It was less than five minutes. We did more walking and getting to the floor than what we spent inside. Returning to the parking lot, we entered the AT&T place where she asked for info to change from Movistar.

I maybe will consider changing companies, too. It's 200 pesos each month, but I would have internet both here and in the United States.

From there we considered our options of what to do. We could eat teriyaki or ramen. There was both Plaza Rio and Playas. At first we decided to go to the teriyaki from playas where they serve us Miso soup and from there going to Argana.

When we parked in front of the place, she notices first how it was closed. What other options did we have? We could go to the sushi place in the harbor or there was a giuseppis close, too. She parked somewhere near the beach and we walked towards the other japanese place. Getting down the stairs a man told us to be careful because of the wind. Both of us were holding the skirts of our dresses. I turned and just smiled acknowledging him. Catherine hit my hand as a signal to not do that.

We got in thinking about ordering teriyaki. The last time we went was last year and I was wearing a dress as well. I ordered two pieces of sushimi, white raw fish over rice and a roll of tuna and salmon. Catherine ordered a yakimeshi and her soup. From there we walked in the beach. This was the first time that I stepped into the sea wearing a dress. The feeling was new and bizarre.

She took some pictures.

Before Argana we stopped by WalMart where she bought the mason jar with the S for me.

Argana was so hot that we change tables and sat outside. There was two women beside us and a group of three teenagers by the wall. She took me home. Nymeria is seated on my lap again. She was asleep most of the time that I wrote this.

### 2016-09-27

Nymeria is on my legs and standing on her back legs trying to reach the desk. I decided to put her down.

The same woman who appeared on the trans segment of the daily show with Trevor Noah is the protagonist of Her Story.

She's a waitress who's approached by a lesbian journalist doing a story on trans people. The short series is about 6 episodes no longer than 12 minutes. The first ones are close to seven and the last one is the longest.

Why did I choose to watch it? Where did I read about it? I had known before. It's not something new. I think it was yesterday in an article titled the series about trans people besides Transparent. I've never really been interested in watching that one. A trans woman of older age, parent of several grown children. Why does that make me uncomfortable? Was that my fear, growing old and realizing my whole life passed and spoiled.

I am not a young transitioner. I started hormone treatment in my twenties. I turned 23 the day I called to make the appointment of the endocrinologist. In my 21st birthday I wrote for the first time in the journal I was not a man. The feelings were not new in any sense, but it was the first time that I acknowledge them in any way.

David added me on Facebook, but he never really talked to me since my out post. He greeted me and started saying that he had a consultation.

He knows a 6 year old girl who was assigned male at birth. Her parents are taking it well according to him, but he wanted to check with me.

I am an expert. I might had not taken a master or specialty but I am confident I know about this more than some sexologists. I've been through this. I know about HRT and hormone blockers and the theories, but current and outdated. I studied psychology, I know how to do clinic interviews and psychotherapy and evaluations.

Why do I doubt myself?

Her parents are supporting, she goes to a private and including school. Her mother deals with the anxiety of telling her grandparents.

I answered his questions and gave him my opinion. I concluded telling him how I did not know the reference of an expert in the field but he could give them my contact if the wanted any kind of orientation or consult. He thanked me and said he gave it to them so they could fill me with their questions.

I think about how could it be, seeing them and answering their questions, seeing the girl and talking to her. They haven't even contacted me, possibly the won't and I still can't help but feel like an expert.

I am not ashamed of they knowing me, seeing me, of sharing my history and experience.

When I told Catherine my doubts about the difference with helping a stranger and my own sibling, she said it was obvious because of the closeness of the lather. And yet it doesn't really ease the tension of the thought.

Catherine worked today. Nymeria woke me and I fed her a little earlier than usual. I tried getting back to bed but I did not sleep much.

In the day I took my book with the intention of reading another chapter, finishing it and passing to a more formal and useful one. I didn't even open it.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. I have things to talk about. I felt sad and miserable this past week. I did not call Yolanda nor updated my resume. I felt trapped in my home and in my situation, the frustration and impotence are like a pool full of water that barely covers my head and my feet are tied to lead. I am heavy and can't jump. I can see the surface, I know it's close, just a jump ahead but still unreachable. There is no way to swim nor float. Time is running out and I'm drowning.

Catherine changed company of mobile. Tomorrow she might come home and play with Nymeria for a while. I want her here, close, with me. I want her to hug me and caress me and care for me just like I care for Nymi.

Penelope just started in Spotify. A couple of days ago Chevo posted in Facebook "And her little eyes full of yesterday" I recognized the lyrics and wondered if Monica would too. I commented how that song makes me cry.

"Somebody ruined it for me" I thought about writing.

Did she? I feel melancholy when I hear it, but isn't that the point?

Who would be Penelope? I or she?


### 2016-09-28

Monica Gonzalez's 23rd birthday, Tomorrow

Why does my machine think I care about the date? I deleted her from my phone and everywhere, or so I thought. I did think about yesterday. Had it passed? Yesteryear I wondered about congratulating her or something.

"Thanks", was her answer. This time there is no doubt about what I'll do. I'll just try to forget about it.

I am trapped. I am trapped in a history, and in this house and in a foreign name. I've always hated the narrative of a woman trapped in a man's body. I reject it . And yet being caged is my whole penance now.

I had read how a person commented how the procedure of changing the name and gender marker was exclusive for the people who were born in the capital. For a moment I was scared, petrified. What if it were true? I would never be able to get out, because of something totally out of my control.

Later another one posted how it wasn't true. You don't have to be born there, but you do need to have a way of prove your residence.

Today was a kick in the gut. Wednesdays are the days which I am sure of going out. I know for a fact that I'll get out of the house and I'll see the world and walk its streets and have a place to be and someone to see. This week I needed therapy, I needed to talk.

Moments before I would get up from the couch to get ready my grandma mentioned how there was no water. Nobody said anything, there was no mention of it on the news nor the internet. We were not prepared, there wasn't even water in the gallons. I had no way of getting ready. My hair was a mess, how could I put make up on my face? How could I get out of the house without shaving?

I decided to cancel the appointment. Even knowing that Rene might charge me for the missed session, I decided to.

Catherine and I had the plan of meeting today. She'd come home and play a while with Nymeria. Was it cancelled? We said nothing about it. Catherine would go out to meet Jessica so she could borrow her a book of psychology for a class of her brother. I returned to bed with tears in my eyes and disappointment deep in my hearth. I slept for no more than an hour. When I got up, 30 minutes before the time of my appointment, I realized the water had returned.

Should I shower? Maybe Catherine could come, anyway. She'd be out of her house. I wanted, needed her. I told her.

I climbed the stairs to the bathroom, and Nymeria, being left alone, followed me the whole flight. I took a picture of her on my lap and climbing my chest. "Come visit us, don't say no to this cutie... I need you"

She told me how she hadn't said anything home. She wanted to stay, she hadn't said anything about this saturday nor monday either.
I could go to her house, though. I told her no. Why did I? I was upset, annoyed and angered. I have nowhere to go and nobody to see. I feel lonelier than ever. I had to cancel, again, another plan. My therapy session, somewhere where I could talk about all of the reasons that keep me in bed and in tears. And she threw it to my face. She didn't want to go because she had other plans later. She has to go this weekend for her paycheck of her job and monday, when she'll go to a theme park.

I slept most of the day. We talked about it in the evening. I said how I felt and she apologized. I cancelled, too, the plans for saturday. I don't have many dollars and I need the money. She invited me this Friday to go out for breakfast. I didn't know. It'd be cheap, I could be out and seen. She said she'd go out in the night and I told her no.

Nymeria woke in a scream. I turned to see and she started shaking and trembling. I brought her to my lap. I care for her, I love her. I'm caressing her trying to calm her. "What is it, Nymi? It's ok, it was a dream. It's ok, darling. It's ok"

I am not alone. I have her. That's the reason I wanted her, didn't I?

### 2016-09-29

Catherine is on her way home. Tomorrow she'll work as well. She read her schedule wrong. She's in by 8 so her out time would be somewhere around one or two. She asked me to accompany her home tomorrow and stay to watch movies or something. She wants to cry. She completed a full shift of 8 hours today.

Last night I told her how I felt. I was upset but there was a deep sadness buried in my chest. "Sofia... I love you", she sent me before falling asleep. "I love you very much, too". A couple of minutes I sent her another text: "I am in so much pain".

"Sofi, do I make you feel alone?" she replied back in the early morning before I was woken up by the cries of Nymeria. It's not her, not really, but I do feel lonelier than ever. It's being here, and having nothing to do but wait. Just a day before the start of October. I did not even started drafting the story to send to the contests of sexuality tales. I've written a quarter of a thousand pages daily for months but I haven't started a project that supposedly I feel passionate about.

Tomorrow is the last day of September, a day before the third to last month of the year, a month before the start of the application process. I am not sure still about which master program to apply. Today is my ex's birthday. It does have its benefits not having her on Facebook. I won't stumble on our friends' congratulations nor will I give a thought about the number of people compared to mine, nor will I try to suppress any thoughts crossing my mind after reading the nauseous messages of her partner.

Yesterday I shared my thoughts of my mother having her still on her friend list and the possibility of her being one of the people who would send a message.

"Besides them being friends, how do you feel about it? That tomorrow is her birthday?"

I told her how it was different to last year in the sense that there is no doubt or worry about what to do or not to do. This time it's obvious. I feel anger and resentment still. I don't know really why or how to stop.

I read something about holding a grudge. It's a way that I keep her in my mind and thoughts when she has moved on. I'll never be free if I don't let her go and forgive her. In her mind I'm the one who does not deserve forgiveness. Does it mean that I'm in her mind and thoughts as well?

Has she received the box? Did she throw the stuff I gave her? What of those would I care to get back? I remembered in the wedding about the Seville handcrafted fan. She never gave me the francs. Does she keep the fridge magnets?

I did love her.

For the first time I can really write without any doubt that I don't anymore.

It's not like I lied to Catherine when I told her that I would never return to Monica's side, or that I didn't want to.

I think of her and remember our memories and recall the video I made and I just feel nothing. I am happy with Catherine. I cherish our memories, even now that I was upset just yesterday with her, I think back to when I juggled the decision of whom I wanted to be with.

I picked Catherine. I almost lost her. She was close to cut her ties with me, stop looking for me, to let me go, when I reached out and we reconnected. I, honestly, don't know where would I be today without her.

In the bathroom I remembered about a skype conversation with Monica before her October's departure. She was already in her relationship. She started to change clothes and undressed herself in front of the camera. Was it her blouse or pants? I saw her underwear and was not excited. I felt uncomfortable. "Don't you have a boyfriend?... Do you expect me to go there?... I won't..."

She put her clothes on and made no comment. Had she any intention? Why do I think about it? Would it change anything? Just as she could not think of me in the last months, she might struggle with the idea of liking me. But it changes absolutely nothing.

I answered Jessica's message asking for the textbooks. I invited her home and she accepted. I showered but stayed in pajamas. She came and I let her in. She knows where I live. She's seen my house.

Catherine will be home soon. Nymeria is asleep between my feet.

### 2016-09-30

I have a headache and not much intentions of writing and finishing the words. Nymeria is biting the lining of my boxspring under the bed. I cam home and cleaned the shit and urine outside of the mat. I fed her and she almost shat again on the same place. Nymeria now is quiet after barking at me because I didn't let her bite anymore.

Catherine is on the other window, in the chat of whatsapp.

I dreamed today with Monica. She was in a car with me. I don't remember the reason why but she was looking at my breasts, as if she were measuring them. She told me, in a manner of conclusion, how I could use certain kind of bra. There was a conversation that I've already forgotten. It ended with me saying no and then she ending with a bye. Was she proposing something? Her closure was the same of mine. No, I replied to her "don't look for me anymore ... you behaved like an asshole" with an OK.

After her departure in my dream. It was something like a ghost leaving, maybe a reference to the phantom I used to mention? Or like the scene in HIMYM when Ted lets Robin go as a balloon, but less melodramatic.

I tried to sleep after feeding Nymeria but it was all for naught. I stepped out of the kitchen and noticed a plate with two separate eggs, one was over easy and the other scrambled. It was covered with a napkin. In the pan, there were fried tortillas scrambled with eggs and chile. I returned to my room realizing that being 7 in the morning my mother hadn't left for school yet.

Luis stayed home because the teachers had some kind of conference or meeting. My mother didn't have classes anyway, but that workshop.

Nymeria, after being reprimanded, went straight to her bed and stayed inside. It's funny how I can see the reactions and emotions in her. How, after screaming or calling her attention, she barks back as answering back. Her anger and tainting me pretending to come bite my toes. Then, after not backing down, she resigns and retracts in shame, lowering herself submissive and going to her bed.

Just now she exited. She's here by my feet were she lay down. In this instant she put her head on top of me foot. I love her. I have what I envied of Catherine with MuÃƒÂ±eca.

Catherine went to work since the early morning. We had said that maybe I could go to her house today, watch some movies or something. We decided not to agree on anything because it wasn't sure. Today's shift was open-ended like last week's. I didn't want to repeat that occurrence. She did work her 8 hours. I asked her if she wanted me to go anyway. I was still in my pajamas and in the couch. I had not eaten since noon. Nonetheless what I had eaten until then was plenty.

Something in me didn't want to go. I would need to shower and shave and do my hair and make up, just for a couple of hours of being in her house. What is it with me about wanting to be seen? I want to be noticed and validated. I don't want to stay home or go to somewhere where everybody knows me. I want to face strangers and meet their reactions to me. I want to be addressed in some kind of way, see how people see me.

I asked her if she was sure. She let me decide. I ended up going. I showered leaving Nymeria in my room. I put on shorts and a tank top. I gave her her third meal and left. I parked the car and noticed two old men outside the mom and pop shop across the street from her house. One of them was Cathy's grandpa. Would he recognize me? I noticed both of their sights on me and saw their lips move as their eyes were fixated on me parking. How would he see me? As Catherine's boyfriend? Or Catherine's girl friend that stayed the other day.

Catherine met me on her porch and told me to move the car. I had parked it in front of her house, away from the men. I moved and they saw me. He told me how it was dangerous because of the big trucks and buses that sometimes pass.

We ate chinese food and watched the first episode of Luke Cage. The first minutes of Cloud Atlas and the series Her Story. We kissed on her couch and talked.

I liked today. I love her and love seeing her. She had her first paycheck today.

## October, 2016

### 2016-10-01

Nymeria is on the floor. She's still with her fore legs on mine although she has just fallen from my lap. I've returned from Catherine's car outside the private. This time we didn't go out, nor she brought me home from her house. I accompanied her outside after spending the afternoon here. We were talking about Mexico. I opened up, "I'm nervous about everything that's ahead". What can I do? How can I do it? I showed her the status before when we were in the couch. Someone posted in Reddit if it counted as discrimination when he was denied information about an apartment because the building was a "family place", of mom, dad and children. He referred as his Significant Other as partner instead of girlfriend, so he assumed that the landlord took the presupposed sexual orientation as the cause of denial.

If being gay was cause enough of being denied. What would happen with me, someone who is trans. A "man" who thinks is a woman. A freak that looks like a girl but has a boy's name in her papers.

Catherine's response was just a frown. There was nothing else to say.

In her car, I explained how it wasn't just that. I'd have to be accepted to the master program, then finding somewhere to live and the whole process of changing the id, as Ivan still. After that could I start with the whole process of the name in the birth certificate and then the id again and the CURP and the papers in the university and everything else.

She said that I'm taking everything at once. One step at a time, she proposed, posing her hand upon my thigh.

Looking for a place to live is the first place. The master program? What if I'm denied? What if they refuse my entrance because I'm trans?

What will I do if I don't even get to the program? How can I stay here, where I can't change anything, where I don't dare to look for a job, where I'm trapped in an arrested development. I cried in desperation in her car. It was the realization of the words I said in the discussion of early today.

We talked about going to the United States, maybe going to In N Out. She invited Anahi. Everything was set until she started calculating the money needed for transportation and gasoline and parking. She was almost touching the red figures. We cancelled and she concluded with a "I was already excited about today. It's like I'm getting up again just to be thrown back."

"Tell me about it", this has been my last weeks. "I feel mine and yours".

There was something in those words that made me lose it. I did not scream nor insult her. I said no more than three words, and yet those were enough:

"I doubt it"

"Wey, I try looking for the chance of going out with you and I see how you get when I have to cancel you again. I feel guilt. I know you feel bad. I know what it is to feel trapped."

"But I don't feel bad because I won't go out today. You can ask money to your dad. It can even be borrowed, and there, your problems are solved for two weeks. There's going to be a mass for my uncle in Orange and here they're talking about going. We would need to get permits, and that would mean that I'd have to dress as a man and pretend I'm still studying.

You can get your permit and take the driver's test and in two weeks have your license and avoid the spending on transport and parking. I can do nothing to change my name.

Don't tell me you fell both yours and mine."

"I know, I'm ridiculous."

I did not know if she was serious. In my last relationship that could be a sarcastic statement, an exaggeration trying to undermine my point. Was she really thinking she was ridiculous? I don't think her problems mean nothing. But it was the pain of being in front of her issues with the two hundred dollars she received in her paycheck when I don't even have a job.

"I feel you put me aside... You feel nobody can understand, ok, maybe it's true. Maybe I won't get to understand you. I've been here, some years now, by your side. Every step ahead and back I've been here. I'm glad when you're happy, and it hurts me when you're sad. I've seen you beautiful and radiant like in my parents' wedding and I've seen you in your worst when you're crying on my shoulder.

And it hurt me that you underestimate my feeling respecting you and me.

...Can I go to your house?"

We watched Netflix. The first episode of Rick and Morty and the second episode of Luke Cage. We ate meat and tostitos with fruit. We played with my dog.

I love her. Why do I keep trying to hurt the people I love?



### 2016-10-02

I almost forgot to write today's words. I was just coming to my room after watching TV lying on the couch. Nymeria was resting on her flower by my side. I called her to come to bed and asked Luis to turn the lights. I was just about to get onto it, when I saw the computer and remembered.

I don't have the energy. It's weird. This is supposed to help me. These words are an outlet that let me get the feelings out of my chest and unload all thoughts and sorrows that haunt me and cloud my day. Writing here is almost the same as what I do in Rene's office. The blank page can't reply to my discourse. The screen won't reply with an answer or an intervention that will make me see everything from a different perspective.

Last week I did not make it to Rene's. I feel as if I were to see him tomorrow. I won't. It's Sunday.

Yesterday, while Catherine was here, I received a call. I reviewed the first numbers to check for the origin of the caller. In a couple of rings, the in app I have let me know that it was the veterinary. The caller confirmed the place and told me their records show that my pet had an appointment for a vaccine.

This is Mrs Sofia, right?

Was my voice not convincing? Was he just confirming?

Wednesday I'll see Rene and will be able to say to him all the things that have happened. The several times that Catherine had to cancel. The ideas of uselessness and ineptitude that fill me with self-loathing. I feel alone. I feel miserable. I feel frustrated and trapped.

Yesterday in Catherine's car I shared with her some of my anxiety. There are lots of steps and things to do. I can't do none of them yet. I can't even start.

Today I got up and almost begged Nymeria to stay in bed. I feel tired, exhausted. Remembering that my days are empty just makes it worse. I ate my breakfast and took my pills. I haven't refilled the dispenser. I know one of the medications will run out this week. Will I buy them or will ask my mom for help?

Nymeria just left my feet and got herself to her box.

What was it that made me cry today? What was the reason now?

Gabriela shared a post on her Facebook. She placed a heart stating support for the idea in the pictures. "The closet is for clothes" was the name of the page that posted originally. I am not subscribed to it but I am familiar with its nature. It's one of those pages of LGBT support. The pictures followed the same theme: "Not all women..." Not all of them... us? ...

Not all women are skinny, not all women are feminine, not all women shave.

Not all women have a vagina.

I know better than to read the comments. It's not the first time that I see and read the ignorant and hateful and dismissive thoughts of the people. I am not unfamiliar with what most, no, several people might think of people like me.

It being a support place, an lgbt place threw me guard.

The same arguments. How is not natural, how they... we are sick. Men confused or who want to be woman. Feeling like a helicopter, like an animal, like being taller, like being of other race... Woman are born that way. Chromosomes are unchangeable. Why don't we accept our bodies like they are? We are just perpetuating gender stereotypes.

And then, the most hurtful. I can take the hateful people, the religious or ignorant. But these ones, these who state first how they accept us, we should be able to do whatever we want or wear or look as we desire... but we're not men nor women. We are trans, not women. We'll never be women. We're different.

We're people, but not like them.

We're not really people. We're less. We're thrash and worthless.

And then I think, what does it matter changing my name in a piece of paper? What use will there be for getting a fixed birth certificate and changing my documents? Why do I want it? Will it make me more of a woman?

No. It will just help me hide myself. I don't want to fix the papers and documents so everything's in line. I want them so I can shut up and hide this part of me. I want to erase Ivan and not having to mention that history or let anyone know...

That's why it hurts so much that there are several steps even before starting with the procedure.

It doesn't matter that I move to a foreign city. I'll have to take a new id there and let them know I'm trans. When I find a place, the tenants will have to know and be ok with me being trans. The university will know my past and nature and will have to accept me anyway. My neighbors will probably now, my potential grad school mates and teachers.

Everyone will know. I'll be visible, exposed. It'll be the same as here. Except I'll be alone and vulnerable.

### 2016-10-03

"Sofia Way"marks the souvenir that Catherine holds in the picture she just sent me.

She has returned from her trip to Six Flags. I could not get up in the morning. I fed Nymeria by seven as I usually do. My mother hadn't left still. We both returned to bed. I felt tired. There are fractures of snaps of the dream I awoke from.

"You will hate me after not buying it for you"

No, of course not. Nymeria is playing at the back of my chair. She's so young. Three months ago she didn't even exist. Even when I posted my secret online and came out to the world she wasn't even born yet. Two days after that she came to the world. A month later would I go to Mexicali and meet her. Two more weeks later would she come. And here she is. She's not my first pet, but it's the first one that I really care about.

Why can't I take the thought of her leaving out of my head? I see her running and playing, I hear the little bell on her collar and feel the warmth of her white fur brushing my legs as she pass by. Will I miss those things when she'll be gone? Will she go in years? Months? Just today did I start to thing about December.

For a lot I was afraid and nervous about how would Christmas be. Would my relatives behave strangely? How would I feel, how would I dress and present?

I've been to Mexicali, I've presented myself to them and everything was alright. I have nothing to worry about in that sense. How about Nymeria? Will I leave her her? Will we take her with us? Catherine said that by then she might take care of her for me those days. So sure, I might have a solution. In the vet clinic there is a service of sitting, as well.

But, what about months later, when I, hopefully, leave for the capital? Will she stay? Will she miss me as MuÃƒÂ±eca would miss Catherine?

At the same time I want her to both miss me and not. I don't want her to suffer, but I love the idea about somebody caring that much for me. I thought It would be awkward or uncomfortable when they refer to me as her mother, and yet, I feel this weirdly tingle inside.

I was nervous at the beginning of the day. I showered at noon and prepared everything before leaving and taking her to her appointment with the veterinary. They had called me in the weekend.

I usually feel bad because of having nothing to do, and yet, today that I had plans, they made me nervous and uncomfortable. Like the last time I took her, a strange anxiety accompanied me the whole way there. It was as if it were me the one who was going to be pricked.

I brought her to my lap, She's resting between cries. Maybe she wants off. I'm putting her down. She has gone to her bed and jumped over the t-shirt I placed in there for her. Her head lies over the little dog Luis gave her. She was tired.

I told Catherine just now not to wait for me. She was up before dawn. An hour ago she got to her house.She went to Six flags with Anahi, Anahi's cousin and Xennia. It was weird seeing the picture of Catherine and Xennia by Batman sides. The have some faint resemblance. I was just a child and I liked Xennia. What did I see in her.

In jr high, I was infatuated with her. It was a childish fixation. I knew her since we both were fours years old. I saw her. Did the thought of seeing her as my double ever crossed my mind? We looked nothing alike, and yet I saw us similarly. Later Jessica would take her place. She was my "sister". Jessica wanted me, she kissed me once and I never reciprocated.

I remember the fantasies where I put myself in their places.

In elementary school, maybe the last year, there was a time when we always were together. We exchanged my tamagotchi. Every time the professor asked us to group by pairs, we would end up together.

And then I did something, I said something or asked for something or confessed something, and we went apart. We stopped talking. It was as if we didn't know each other.

Did I felt then what I feel now with Monica?

I used to fantasize how years later would we reunite and we'd be so much different and grown. And I see her now in that picture with Catherine, my girlfriend, and I look at Xennia and I see nothing but past and stories yesteryears.

Will it ever come a time when I will feel the same way when I stumble upon a Monica's picture?

### 2016-10-04

The days keep running. Today is October fourth. When was it that I checked the updates of the feeds of webcomics? Was it more than three days ago?

Nymeria is running around like mad. Maybe it's just a rush of energy. Earlier I took my phone and looked the pictures from when I met her, the time when she was just a little puppy. She's grown so much. She barks and runs and comes to me when I call her.

Tomorrow I'll see Catherine and I'll see Rene. 1pm, I think, is when I have the appointment. A week ago I ought to cancel because the water was out. I could not shower and I dared not to go out. Will I talk about it? What if he charges me the lost consult? I've never had to pay him double before. There was just another time that I cancelled less than 24 hours from our appointment.

It was a Thursday, or was it Wednesday? It was when we went to the Mental Hospital in the early morning to take our class there. After the class I would return home and have a couple hours until getting to therapy. This time I was giving a ride to Catherine and Anahi. We saw Marlene drive past us. I made some stupid joke about defending my manliness, so I stepped on the gas to catch up with her. Now, in hindsight, the comment is kind of ironic.

Talking and playing I did not notice the warnings about the bump. No, it was not a bump, the opposite of that. The front tires fell and the hit made the car jump. We all were fine. There was no damage but a broken hose of the radiator. The anti-freeze fluid spilt all under. When I stopped after having smoke come out of the hood, the first thing I did was to call Rene.

I told him I would not be able to get there. I think I said nothing about the crash. Maybe I did. It wasn't until I set that, that I called my father for help.

Catherine will go to the dr tomorrow. She told me that she'd pick me up in the early morning. She hasn't gotten out of her shift. It was 7, I guess, when she got out on her thirty minute break. She will pick me later in the morning. She can go fix the problem of her phone service while I am in session.

Have I thought what will I talked with Rene? I try to recall the issues with the last weeks and I came upon a wall.

I've been feeling alone and inept. I've been fighting with these thoughts and emotions that bring me down.

Is this depression? Is this dysphoria? Is this just a shitty time?

I've been watching South Park. Someone from Telnor called today to give some information about this new service they're offering. He talked about this new number of emergency and my mind ran to the new 911. He addressed me since the very beginning of the call as miss. At first I thought it would be like any of those other calls that they give their information and just hang up.

This time no, he said the number and asked me to confirm it. He asked the relation I have to Jose Luis, the titular of the line. I said I was his daughter. I gave him my full name. When he asked I said Sofia Fernandez. When he asked for the second last name, a sudden rush of anxiety flashed through my spine. What if it was official, what if somehow he realizes I am lying?

Am I lying? Is this why I feel desperation to change the papers? I hate the sensation that my name is a lie, that is not mine.

But it's not. It's not official.

Catherine had to cancel last week, it was Sunday. Did we go out last weekend? What did I do the weekend?

Why is it so hard to remember?

I don't think I'll be writing the short story for the contest. When I read the poster I thought about sending several and I've written none.

I haven't updated the resume. I thought about writing the actual one with my name but I can't. I have to put the official one, the one they'll know me by in the application process.

Lots of things to go through, lots of steps. High, difficult and painful steps.

Will freedom finally come after everything?

### 2016-10-05

I'll start the words early. I'm in the living room seeing Nymeria biting and pushing her flower pillow around. Is she playing or is she just as frustrated as I am?

We didn't agree on a plan yesterday. Catherine went to sleep and I watched some episodes of South Park in the tablet. I remember fragments of the dreams that intercepted the flashes of consciousness in the middle of the night. It had been long since I dreamed as a man with no mention or thought about being trans. There was something about a school. In most of my late dreams the concurrent theme is that I'm a grown student still in school. In this one my voice was deep and the trying of speaking was tiring on its own.

Something about a teacher or a test and its grades. Later something chaotic happened. A storm, maybe? I went out and found Jessica, Chevo's Jessica. I got into the other building and met my "friend". Except it wasn't Eusebio. Sergio. From where is that name? Did his face match the person I know? I haven't known of him in years. Does he know of me? The last time I saw him I was walking with Monica by my side and wanted to be recognized because of the pride I felt having her by my side.

He finished or is studying Graphic design. He went to a summer abroad in Prague. He learned english in Canada. Why did I dream about him?

I talked with Catherine when my alarm sang. It was early. She hadn't gotten up either. Could we postpone? Maybe she could pick me up later. I felt an uneasy feeling, like a premonition of another cancellation.

We didn't cancel. She did pick me up. In fact she was waiting outside when I got out of the bathroom. We went to AT&T near the River Plaza.

I got distracted seeing the site of renting and roommates from the DF. There are several options with a huge range of prices, from the cheaper ones at two thousand to the more expensive ones near the ten K.

That's the reason I returned early. From the plaza near the cell center, she drove us to the sam's one. Where she park was closer to the booths than the stairs. I got down and remembered the time when I got my first kiss. I decided to not mention anything. We walked to Rene's. He didn't charge me the missed session. He asked me to enter early.

The session was hard. I cried most of it. I'm desperate and frustrated. My plans are founded on clouds. What if I don't get to the university? Why don't I move earlier than the application process? My parents will help me anyway, won't they? Do I count on them for helping me? I remember my father comment of how he would not maintain me on another city.

Will I be alone? I counted on Catherine, I was afraid of her not getting in and letting me go. Now, if I go earlier, what would happen?

It was a hard session. I got out with more doubts than the ones I got in. He told me to actually have plans, not see them far away. What if I don't get in? When will I go?

What other options besides the capital do I have?

I can ask for asylum in Canada. I might marry Catherine and fix the papers. No. Catherine would not marry me. Is that why I had that faint but dangerous feeling that I can't count on her?

It's unfair to expect her to marry me. I love her, she does love me.

Could, should I look for a job? Should I send the so thought e-mail to the SER NGO that gives trans care? Can I ask them for a job or a volunteer option?

I thought again about the course, the MMPI course that I considered giving. I have the worksheet. I've graded it. I know it.

Would people really be interested to take it? How much can I charge?

Looking at the renting site gave me a short-lived peace of mind. There are postings cheap enough to be practical. I read the bio of the ones offering and there is even an option for looking to rooms that are welcome to LGBT people.

Still, I didn't get to mention it in session, but I just remembered that even in the LGBT community, I might not be totally welcome.

Where, where in this world will I ever be?

### 2016-10-06

I am afraid I'm having suicide ideation again.

I got up to feed the dog and feel this imminent and heavy load on top of my chest. I returned to bed and tried to sleep again. Lately she's been easier to stay in bed after urinating and, sometimes, pooping. I got up not much later knowing that I won't be falling asleep easily if I stay in bed. Catherine would enter after noon. In the morning she got ready.

After seeing the renting site yesterday I stayed with the idea of the city and the possibilities of going and surviving. I looked at a job sites, it was just the intention of knowing the job market and situation in there. Are there much of offerings for people in my field? Are there some research positions? Human resources? Psychologists?

I had the price ranges of the site in mind when looking the salaries. My mood took a dive. I was falling non-stop to the dark pit that I used to call home.

Was Catherine out already of her shift when we talked? I just mentioned how I was seeing the job offerings and feel inept when seeing that the experience I have doesn't fit to what they're looking for. I searched for CV templates so I can finally upgrade mine. There is no point in putting my name in the applications if none of my papers are changed. The university one, too, will have to be named under my legal name.

It's like a short chain that keeps my hands tied to my feet. I can't move and my back is aching.

I need to change my name to apply for a job, but I need to move the capital to change my name, but I need a job to move to the capital.

Catherine's support was disheartening.

"Didn't you make the little chicken, son?", I ignored her. I just heard the word and stayed quiet and continuing writing. She called my attention calling me Sofi. Catherine told me before how I could say something, correct them. What's the point?

I told her before entering her shift that I was stressed and tired. She asked me if I knew the reason. Of course I know. When does it lessens? Since yesterday, never. It's been a continuing curve of distress and worry. I am afraid. I feel hopeless.

I told her how It's so real now. I will have to endure it all by myself.

"You don't know that"
"I don't know what?"
"Well... Nevermid"
"You're entering now... I'm afraid of ending whoring myself"
"I thought that to the master we would go together, but yesterday you were thinking of leaving January. You won't end up doing it"

Then she got in and four hours later got out.

I am sitting down after looking for Nymeria. A lump is stuck in my throat and my eyes start to water. It's like my heart is slowing down and skipping beats. Every heartbeat hurts and is stronger than the last.

She asked me if I would consider working in a call center. Would I? Would I really? I doubt it and the mere thought stabbed me like a dagger. She mostly focused and talking with my parents. Actually consulting them on what could happen, if they would support me.

Yesterday thinking about telling her about my dad almost made me cry again outside Rene's. How can I ask my dad for support when he directly told me No six years ago? Would it be validating his fears letting him know that I am not able to ask for a job interview in my situation?

"I know telling yo to start working is too much, I know you would have to do it as Ivan"
"Then why are you doing it?

I almost begged her to stop. I couldn't take it.

"Because if you start to work you would start to solve plans", she kept on with an audio and more messages.

"...I don't know what else to tell you"

"Don't say anything, don't talk to me"

She sent another audio. "Really?... Ok"

"You're not helping me. You're making me feel worse. I'd rather die than go back to be Ivan for another six months."

I don't know what to do. I don't know if I can take it. I am scared. I can't do it. It's too much, I am not alone, but why don't I feel otherwise? Why is it so hard for me to ask for help?

Do I? Do I really prefer to die?

Will that be the only option before being homeless and turning to prostitution?

### 2016-10-07

What is it of these last days? I did not send the e-mail to the editor who asked for freelancer writers.

I had the pictures of the contact of the recruiters for the call centers. Last night, when I was in bed I could not fall asleep. I kept thinking about the courses I could offer. I know the supplement scales, and I have the spreadsheet to grade them. I know other tests that they don't teach in the university. The inventory on anxiety, the one of self-perception... When I thought about them an idea came to my head. I could post on the group of the university how when grading an MMPI manually I made myself a spreadsheet to save me from using the transparencies. Would that be something they'd be interesting in buying? The spreadsheet alone would be almost incomprehensible. But maybe they'd be interested, in a coursework? Those scales are not seen in the university.

How many of them would take the course? I could get an idea of the number of people that might take it. I thought about checking the capacity of the conference room in Cupsi. After another hour of turning in the sheets I grabbed my phone and logged into the site. There is an advert promoting the services of Cynthia. Several hours were taken. When I tried looking for the big one, I could not find it. It's not offered anymore. And then, the plan I had, the solution that I could follow instead of resigning to look for a temporal job and another months hiding in the rotten persona that is Ivan, was over.

What else could I do? In what other way could I offer it?

It's been hours since I started and I am not even by half.

Was it after or before the realization that I thought about the pitches I could offer the editor? It was before. I asked Catherine if she thought I was weak, vulnerable. I told her how I couldn't help but wonder why would anybody read what I can say.

"From everyone our age, you are the smartest person I know. I love what you write, for school and yourself."

What were the ideas? I could write about my own experience, personal and intimate essays. Or I could write about more technical and informative topics.

The first pride I went to, all the process from crossing the border in boy mode, to putting on feminine clothes for the first time outside, to getting to the actual parade, the break of silence in honor of the fallen trans brothers and sisters who have ended their lives, to the culmination of pride, the acceptance of knowing that who I am is something to be proud of.

I could talk about the stages of coming out, first to myself, to my partner soon to be ex, to my closest friends, to my mom, to my family and finally to the world.

I thought how writing about those things and putting my name on those could not be a perfectly good idea. Do I really want my personal information online? Something as private as talking about the first time I wore feminine clothes outside a hotel room, or how I told my love ones that I was trans.

The other subjects I could talk about, more impersonal, less dangerous to publish, could be talking about the difference between dysphoria and dysmorphia. How being transgender is not the same thing as being delusional or dysmorphic, the difference between wanting to cut off an arm to a penis. The double dysphoria, how depression and dysphoria might go hand in hand and worsen each other off. The pros and cons of Informed Consent and the Gatekeeping of the formal route.

Somewhen after those thoughts I fell asleep. Did I dream something? Was this night when I dreamed again of my ex? Another reunion and truce? Coming out of the dream but still in another one, I thought how it would be impossible to talk, to mention it, to ask.

I read today, another chapter of the book that I can't seem to finish.

Catherine has her permit now. She went to do her test and passed it on her first try. I opened the files of the resumes but have not written anything on anyone. Tomorrow we might go the United States. In the evening we will go to the reunion in Paola's house. A six of beers and bag of chips.

Andrea will be invited, will she say something?


### 2016-10-09

Yesterday I cheated. I maybe could had done them, but decided not to. The last plan was that Catherine would come pick me up and we would return in her car or I could take a uber if I'd prefer to stay.

Word is almost out of its license term. We were going to go to the United States to buy a new yearly license and other stuff. My dad didn't buy breakfast. I got up early and showered after him. My mother and my father renewed the license online. My mother decided to stay home with my grandma and Nymeria. My brothers and father crossed the border. It was a little uncomfortable going on the copilot seat. My father didn't addressed me in the old name or used masculine pronouns. My fingernails were painted red and my clothes were feminine. When I got out of the house my mother asked me if I were not going to paint my mouth. My lips were already painted in the light color.

I didn't want to correct her. The crossing border patrol made no questions or comments about me or my appearance. He asked were would we be going and doing and he let us go.

Where did we go from there? We ate at Denny's. When we got there we were seated by someone who wasn't serving. Was he a manager? He had this earpiece and was busy doing some other things. The waitresses were busy with other tables and we were left ignored. Was it because of me?

Finally a busboy came and said he could take the order of our drinks while a waitress got free. He spoke in spanish. When he turned from my father to me, he stopped himself mid-word. Was he going to say sir? Was he going to say miss? His face was of surprise. Not much time later the waitress return and asked us again.

We went to Target and I bought several things. From a plate and food for Nymeria to a bralette and a hoodie. I bought a blouse, a long tunic but it's too big. I look like a child wearing her parent's clothes.

We went to a Hot Topic store and a Best buy. It was fun being with my brothers, the three of us teasing and laughing. I asked Luis about how he was going to buy a purse, and why he didn't take it. He said my father told him people would make fun of him, mock him for wearing it. He said it should not matter, he has the right to wear or use whatever he wants. And everybody respects him anyway because he can solve a rubik's cube.

We stopped by Taco Bell, before coming home.

I showed Catherine what I bought. She said she was uncomfortable thinking about her clothes. She wanted to go but skip all about getting ready.

I changed clothes and was unsure about what to wear. It wasn't cold enough but it wasn't that hot either. I wanted to look feminine, Andrea and her boyfriend had not seen me after I came out publicly. I was nervous about them, their comments, their reactions.

I felt I could not ask for Catherine's help. I was ready so I offered Catherine to pick her up and return in uber, like we had planned before. She said yes so I had no time to finish the words. We were on our way home in the Freeway when in the group conversation Paola asked if someone could pick her up. I told Catherine to offer her a ride.

She accepted and we all stopped in a Calimax in my neighborhood. We bought beer and chips. She grabbed a bottle of Black Tears for Chevo.

Before leaving the house I asked my dad to move the Pick up. I had first told him how Catherine would pick me up so he was a little confused. I explained I'd be bringing her here and we would take an uber. "Or could you give us a ride?"

He agreed.

Catherine told Paola that he would fear my Dad. He's intimidating and looks angry.

He greeted them and we put our stuff in the back. He drove us and left us in Paola's house. He asked me if I would want him to pick me up, but I said no. He waited for us to enter the house and then left.

Andrea and Rafa were already there.

"It's been a lot since the last time I see you" she told Catherine when she hugged her. "well, the two of you", she completed when she saw me in the neutral masculine way.

It was... hard. When they later referred to me as Ivan, it confirmed my anxiety. I was worried they'd be doing it all night. I felt self-conscious. Didn't I look different enough? Was I too manly?

Luckily, after everyone kept talking about me in the feminine and by my name, they caught up. When Paola's boyfriend came, no one said anything about me. Paola introduced me as Sofia. He greeted me by a kiss in the cheek. Does he know? Does Paola's sister?

Was my voice not too obvious?

We smoked hookah and drank. We played beer pong and Fuck you and a game Chevo introduced which you had to put a table tennis ball into a cup before the other cup came to you. We had lots of fun.

Paola is officially in a relationship now. I felt more attached to everyone of them. I remember when we all hang out in the university I could not get this feeling away of being two groups of friends interacting. I sat beside Paola and she called my name and hit me in the leg when I teased her.

Paola was the first one to leave. Then Andrea and her fiance. They said good bye using my name and he even kissed my cheek.

A little after two in the morning we left. There was an issue with the uber. He waited for us in the other street.

Paola used my phone to set it all right.

He picked us up and took me home. She got to hers not much later.

I dreamed with Paola. Maybe the sudden feeling of closeness was a thought that stayed in my mind when I fell to sleep. I put on my pajamas and lied down while Catherine went to her room. I put Nymeria on my legs, we both were falling asleep. She was awake in her box when I got into my room.

A couple hours later I saw her walking on my side in the bed. Both of us had fallen asleep.

In the morning I fed her and felt nauseous still. The room spun around. I tried to stay sleeping but it was hard with her barking.

I ate breakfast and took my pills. I haven't sorted the ones for the next week. I downloaded a trial for a week of Photoshop and Illustrator. I haven't updated the resume nor talked to my parents about my plans.

I did ask my dad yesterday in the united states the prices of the rent in the capital and my thoughts about selling the jetta. I didn't say I wanted to use the money to maintain myself the first months there. I don't recognize what is it that scares me. Does he know my intentions of actually being in Mexico city?

I could make two hundred and fifty more words to reach the limit, to fill the quota that I missed yesterday.

I have more visible stubble. Even now after just a day of shaving I can see the black little hairs on my moustache and chin and even my cheeks. There is a promotion on the laser place where if you buy more than three sessions they give you a 50% discount. I used a similar deal for buying four sessions. I could use three this time, but I don't have the money. Should I tell them I am trans? Do they have to know?

I've been five months on hormones now. one hundred and seventy days today. In two weeks I'll have been on them for half a year. Do I look different enough?

Am I content with how I look?

Yesterday my mom told me how Jessica is upset because I have more bust than her. "I use fillings, too". But I don't.

My bras are a little small on the cup now. I bought another one yesterday but it doesn't fit right. The band is too tight, even on the furthest hook.

I hope is colder soon so I can wear coats and hoodies. I am more comfortable covering my body.

There are some flea bites on my feet and legs. Days before I found two bug bites on my left thigh. Today I found another one on my right.

The little red balls on my feet are itching. The rash I had on my elbow is dry now. Will it heal?

Will I heal?

### 2016-10-10

Nymeria is under me, she's playing with her snake. I am watching South Park on the tv in the living room. The episode right now is the one where the gang is on a school news show and is being cancelled because of a more popular show. I've seen it already. I can focus on writing and just hear the conversations of the first half that I didn't see.

Catherine was here earlier. Just half an hour ago she left.

I didn't remember when was it that we had plan for her to come.

In the morning I woke up near seven when Nymeria woke up and asked for food. She didn't let me sleep after that and I decided to get up anyway and came to the living room. I lied on the couch and ate my breakfast before taking my pills. In a couple of weeks I'll be turning six months on hormones.

I put South Park and let Nymeria fall asleep on my lap. The first and only episode finished and my eyes were closing. They felt so heavy that it was tiring keeping them open. I woke Nym up and took her to her box and put myself on bed. I fell asleep not much later. I know I dreamed several things. Was my dad on them? Was Catherine?

I remembered them when I woke up.

Last night I put several books on my waiting list in Amazon. Most of them were of Trans themes. Am I really interested in reading them? Did I made progress yesterday? No, it was before that. Lately I haven't opened it. The folder of the CV templates is still unopened and the countdown of the trial keeps getting smaller.

I stopped the episode and put the next one. I recognized the moment when they go to the pharmacy to buy the cough syrup so they can get ideas. The next one is the one with Paris Hilton and the contest of whoring with Mr Slave.

This is the next one. I haven't seen it.

I slept while Nymeria got up and my grandma fed her. I kept dreaming and resting. I got up after noon and I had a message of Catherine that she was showering.

I got ready. I put out a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. I wore the black bralette that I bought this weekend. I decided not to put any make up on. After just a shower I still felt comfortable with my face.

Catherine got here after some minutes. She sent me a message asking me what to bring. I told that she didn't have to bring anything but her cute little toochie. She told me that she could pass to the Oxxo before coming here. I came to her car and we drove down. We bought a bag of tostitos and a bottle of clamato.

In here we saw an episode of Luke Cage and ate chicken and rice. We were in the couch watching the last parts of the episode when I started brushing her thigh under her dress with the tip of my fingers. I told her how in the morning, while I was watching television I let my hand slip into my pajama pants and started caressing the tip of my sex.

Sex... Why didn't I type penis? Don't I dare to call it by its name? Before, there were moments when I called it clitoris. She called it that way as well... When was it when she mentioned me her doubts about that and how should she refer to my genitals.

She told me that she felt that kind of urges, too, but she did satisfy them. We both thought about going to my bedroom like before. I don't remember who was the one that actually mentioned it.

The episode finished and we went there. We kissed and touched each other. She was wearing a black dress and just after I thought it she mentioned that I should be wearing another one. I mentioned I could change and after considering she agreed. I put on the gray one she gave to me and let her see me in my new underwear.

We had sex, she was touching me when I warned her that I'd be coming soon. Nothing came out. It's a month and a half since I had an orgasm.

We kept doing it and I made her finish.

We watched Mean Girls until my family arrived.

She brought the formats and tests. I can sort them according to their type and pass and scan the ones that correspond to us.



### 2016-10-11

Am I in an endless nightmare?

I feel trapped in those sorts of dreams where I have a complete different life with other past and worries and I'm terrified of the future. I know I dreamed something. It wasn't in the morning, but at the nap I took at noon. My family kept calling me Ivan and it hurt. I can't remember the rest. Some sort of conferences and halls with chairs.

It wasn't important.

Will I wake up now? And all of these worries and problems won't be important, I won't even be able to remember after a couple of hours of being awaken.

In less than two weeks I'll be turning 6 months. Am I different enough? Is that a good or a bad thing?

I finished grouping the formats of my part time job. I do have a part time job, more of a freelancing gig. I have something to do, even though I don't do nothing. I have opened the Curriculum templates but have filled none of them.

One of the applications has been up. The master of neurobiology is the one. Will I apply to that one? I don't need letters of recommendation and that means I could avoid going for teachers and dealing with asking for and reading letters of Ivan's achievements and skills.

I can't even get to half of the words.

It's monday and I haven't sent the e-mail to the editor who asked for trans writers. Will I do that? Or will it be another passed opportunity?

Yesterday I talked with Catherine. I mean, we talk everyday but there was something different this time. Today we haven't talked much. I don't feel like it. In the bathroom I considered breaking up. Am I mad? Am I angry? No. Then what is it? What happened?

She told me how her parents were sleeping in different beds. They've been fighting lately and she's sick o it. I asked her how would she react if they got a divorce. They haven't been married for more than a month and they're already sleeping in different beds.

"I've seen them together, married by the civil, now by the church, and things don't change, doesn't matter the hassle that is marriage. I don't know, I don't feel excitement or illusion. And I know you do, a little."

She had told me before when I asked her to talk about getting married, filling the papers of immigration. She doesn't want us to get married just because of a green card. She doesn't want it to be just because of convenience. And now she tells me she sees no reason to do it.

"Then why don't you want to marry me?"

"Honestly, I think we need to grow before engaging to each other. It's not about age or maturity. But you need to get to know yourself a lot. And I need to accept myself, too. I'm still scared that my family knows I like women, you're still absorbed in yourself and sometimes I feel left behind. With those feelings I don't feel ready to marry you."

I told her about how it's because she's going to USA and I feel here. I feel trapped and she's one of my keys to get out. She says she wants to be with me, apply to the master and get into it.

"But if you don't get into it, you can just keep on with your life without me. It hurts that I need you more than you me."

"You have to find your life, without me, without nobody. Even if I go, you'll have to move and start accommodating your life. Here I couldn't come with you everywhere. There is no way for me to guarantee that I'll be with you forever.
I'm not saying that I don't want to be with you or that I won't.
It's the truth, we don't know what can happen. In March I had surgery, in January that you made your appointment to the endocrinologist we never thought I'd be recovering from surgery when you would go.
It hurts, I know you're hurt, but we haven't had a single date without talking about this.
We don't know what's going to happen, Sofia."

I read her message and said nothing. What was there to say? What was it that hurt me so much? Is it the fear of being alone? Are the words of Rene resonating in my mind about having a support network and needing to expose myself and ask for help? She's telling me that I can't count on her nor anyone. I have to do this alone. But it is too much for me. I can't.

I thought about breaking up. Fifteen minutes later she sent another message:

"I love you. I hug you and am fascinated by your scent, I like feeling you close. I like chatting with you and watch the TV together. I feel comfortable, at peace with you"

Half an hour later I answered back that I loved her and another half hour later I dreamed again with the ex that left me.

### 2016-10-12

My grandmother asked me if I have a picture of Nymeria when she was small and I just bought the flower cushion. I searched in my phone and actually have one from the day I bought the cushion. She's lying on the center, her tiny body barely covering the yellow circle. She was over almost the whole cushion. She's grown. She's changing color, from a recently born white to a cinnamon brown tint.

What happened today?

I did not sleep after getting up and serving Nym's breakfast. I returned to bed but she did not let me sleep. I got up. Last night Catherine sent me a text message asking if I love her. I answered yes. I hesitated. What was it? Is the chat about marriage? Is it the feeling of betrayal? What did she do to betray me? She hasn't cancelled her application. She says she wants to, and is going to. I'm projecting all my fears unto her. I'm blaming her for the anxiety of being alone.

I went to the kitchen and ate the burrito that was wrapped and then made another one with the leftover in the pan. Did I watch television? Did I read? What did I do?

I showered and got ready for leaving to therapy. I wore the crimson jeans and the gray long-sleeved blouse. I hesitated before putting on make up. It's not about looking feminine, it was doubting about if it was worth it.

Nymeria barks now when I leave the house. Does she miss me? Does she love me?

I parked in Sam's parking lot. I keep remembering that time when I wore a gray dress and found Monica and her boyfriend. I won't find her or them when going to therapy. Both of them work for sure.

I walked the blocks to the building and got into the office. It's the second time that I get in early because of an absent patient before my time. I cried in this session, but what was it? He asked something. It triggered a thought but I can't remember it.

I did not mention my thoughts about breaking up with Catherine. Last night before sleeping I realized that breaking up would mean losing another best friend.

I try, and want to, hide who I am. I want to bury down the fact that I am trans and live a normal life. I hate the idea of being discriminated or looked down. I feel that whenever someone, or anyone deny me, I won't have the security to defend my self, who I am.

I hate this vulnerability and sense of fragility.

That's when I cried. When I got that thought and let it out of my mouth.

At work or at school, you can just do that, 'My name is Sofia and I am a trans girl'.

"Let me give you an advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like an armor and it can never be used to hurt you."

He finished the session and asked if the device that was in the couch next to my purse was an ipod. "I thought they don't make them anymore" "They don't, I barely got this one. You have to buy them used."

I got down the elevator and walked back to my car. There was a malfunction with the parking voucher.

Getting home Nymeria got out of her box and came to me. I had to punish her in a time out because of her biting the training mat. She is in my room now, probably asleep.

Lili sent me a text message after returning saying there is an evaluation for this Friday's afternoon. I didn't fill the templates of the resumes but did update mine. I took out several things that I thought useless. Being in the highest places of high school, or exposing an educational software. I took out the autism forum and other stuff... I wanted to take the name out but it has to stay.

I reviewed the guide of the test. It's simple enough, an analysis of a Wechsler test results, the basic information about neuropsychology and neuroanatomy and neurophysiology and a last section of reading comprehension of english texts.

The general one is about the stuff I like about psychology, mostly research and methodology.

Why am I worried, then? Why do I keep doubting about which one to choose? Will they answer my e-mail? Catherine is right, maybe I should call, or send another one.

I have this month to decide.

### 2016-10-13

I got an answer about yesterday. I told Catherine last night to wake me up with her and don't let me fall asleep again, nor let me get to when she'd leave for job without sending the e-mails.

I woke up to feed Nymeria. Catherine was awake already, I guess. Did I dream something? No... In the middle of the night I covered myself from the cold. I failed to stay awake. I made myself breakfast an hour after the first light of the day. I was sitting in the couch watching South Park when she asked me. "Have you sent the e-mails?"

She was right. There were two, no, three e-mails that I promised I would send. The first one was to actually send the message I had redacted in the contact tab of the Master's site, the second was to post a comment in the comment section of the master in psychology and the third one was to contact the editor about the possibility of sending an article for the trans blog.

I tried sending the redacted message but it was stuck. Looking at the other site, I scrolled to see the comments, to review the dates of the last ones, when I got to a message that one of its words struck my attention. It mentioned another master and the possibility of applying to both. I read the answers. The first one was a question asking for clarification, did she intend to take both? Or was it with the intention of having a back up plan and picking lastly the chosen one were she accepted on both.

There was an answer but the question was two years old. I showed Catherine and that was her reply. I grabbed the email under the format of contact and wrote a message on Inbox. I sent it and received an answer a couple of minutes later. An affirmative answer. The system does allow it.

The answer, as expected as it was, made me more nervous.

I can apply to both, I can have twice the opportunities of getting into a prestigious master, of achieving my goal. But twice the possibility makes the fail twice as painful.

I have the guides, the bibliography of one and the content of the other. For one I need the review the things I know, for the other learn what I don't. The thought of driving to the university and studying in the library came to my mind and I actually consider it. Going somewhere, doing something, actually feeling like I am accomplishing something.

Being able to register now, made me feel anxious. I feel the pressure of it. The first thing I tried to calm it was to look at the dates, the deadlines. I have until January to send the first batch of papers. Then I noticed that I have until December to put my data on their system and register myself. The other application opens by the end of November. The first test will be by the second week of February.

It's true, everything is close and near. The dates keep passing by like light-posts on a highway.

It's hard, thinking about everything that I'll endure and do, but at the same time, it's amazing thinking that the changes keep happening and I'll keep looking different.

That will make things harder, still, but... sigh, it doesn't matter.

I told my mom when she arrived about the open application and how I can apply to both. "What are we going to do? How are we going to do it? I mean, the trip and staying there... will I stay from the first trip in february for the first test? It's actually cheaper than going and coming."

She told me to look up the information, the rates of rent and costs and all of that.

My father was at the table. I mentioned nothing, but I guess my mom did. He looked at me and talked at me, but I did not hear him. Instead of calling my name, he repeated himself.

"Is the application open?"

I told him that it was and that I can apply to both. He said nothing more.

Will I work there? How will I maintain myself while at the same time be able to go to the tests and the different procedures that I want to do. I could look for a part time job in the evenings. Or something in the weekends?

I don't know. I don't know.



### 2016-10-14

Three trans women have been killed in Mexico in the last two weeks. Two were in Mexico City and another inside the country. Just now I read the news about a fourth one. It's just a status update on Facebook, shared on the Trans Forum. I tried to ignore it. Not ignored, but stay skeptical. It could be a false alarm, it said it in the message itself.

I viewed the forum and stumbled upon the same post of the girl who put a photo of a thin blonde. I suspected it was fake. In her profile there were just pictures of anime and said she was from London. Even after my suspicion I just ignored her. I don't care about meeting anyone in there. I didn't introduce myself when they accepted me. I'm nobody to criticize or judge her. There were new comments in there, several people had the same suspicion and told her to put a real picture. She had commented that she was stalked before so she was cautious. She added a picture "of a friend and me". Under her comment there were a couple of others telling her nowadays it's really easy to do a reverse search of a picture. If she didn't want to show herself, don't put a picture, but not put a fake one.

I told Catherine about the incidents with Nymeria. Today she pooped and it was kind of liquid, runny. I took a piece of glass out of her mouth. Yesterday, or in the week, Liliana told us about an evaluation. I took it. Catherine has a job already. She picked me up at 4. I saw my patient. Arantza, she's a 21 year old girl who is in because of a depression. She has suicidal ideation already. She tried once already when she was intoxicated.

From there we ate in River Plaza.

I dreamed with Monica again, and couldn't help to think about seeing her somewhere in there. Catherine and I ate Ramen in the Food Garden. We walked to some stores and shopped around. She brought me home and Nymeria welcomed me by the door. She was different, something about her. It seemed like she shat just fine, not runny like earlier. She wasn't excited or hyperactive, it was something else, weird.

I changed the training pads because they were full. She growled at me and threw bites at my ankles. I remember MuÃƒÂ±eca's attacks the first times I were to Catherine's house. I was upset. She's my dog, my puppy, she loved me and came looking for me. Why was she behaving like this?

I tried to put the new pads and tape them to the floor, but she ran at the tapes trying to take them off. I closed the room with her inside to put the one in the living room. She stayed there. When I returned to change clothes, she bit me again but this time it really hurt. Unintentionally I kicked the pain away and she flew a couple of feet almost hitting the closet.

After opening the door, she went to Luis and I heard him saying "No, Nymeria, not there", I thought it was her biting the pad but they were apart from it. I told her not to bite him and approached them. She bit my big toe and I hit her with the roll of newspaper. She squeaked and cried, a lot calmer and lie down on the cushion.

I felt sad and guilty. It was something I oughted to do. It had to be done. She tried going upstairs several times so I shut her in my room.

She's in there right now, quiet. Probably she is asleep now.

I've been writing the words for almost an hour now and I can't seem to finish. I have something to do now. I have a patient, I have two tests to study for and a book to finish.

There was an update on the post about the fourth trans victim. She wasn't dead but in critical condition. She was shot by some people in a gray Audi.

Four people in two weeks. Three in the city I am trying to live in.

I can't stay in this country, I am in danger. But I am trapped. How can I get out? I told Catherine and mentioned the asylum detention centers. If I go to Canada, I won't be able to see my family again.

She asked me if it was something I suppose or I had read about it. I looked it up and it was true. In the United States at least, an asylum-permit can be revoked if there is evidence that the person put itself on danger of being persecuted again.

I told her. And then I saw, Canada uses detention centers, too. There are lots of news and pages talking about the Human Rights breaches in those places, and I felt sick.

"I understand, she told me"

I felt rage. No, you don't.

You're not trans, you have citizenship, how would you understand?

She said nothing but :/



### 2016-10-15

"Have you heard the song? Joaquin Sabina, he has a song called "Black tights", like yours", it was a little awkward but I found it charming. I knew the song, of course. That might have to do with it. I'm hearing it right now. Did I know it because of my ex?

I thought I knew The Beatles because of her, but that's not exactly true. My father had asked me to burn him a disc with the compilation of their discography. Even before that, a classmate in middle school was a fan, he sang the songs and knew their history. I already recognized and were familiarized with Paul's Yesterday.

I dreamed several things but remember scarcely anything. In one of my dreams I had people over, Eusebio and Jessica, and Paolas, as well. I don't remember seeing Monica in there. There were plates of different kinds of food, and there were cards, too, like a type of game. I don't remember seeing any alcohol. It wasn't really this house. Was it in Mexicali? There were other people. Some relatives came and did or said something. Paola S asked if all my family was like that. With "that" she was referring as something like rude or obnoxious. One of them heard and answer back that of course not. They were the good ones.

I explained how they weren't that close, they were the daughters of the brother of my grandma.

Just yesterday I mentioned Catherine how I don't usually dream with her. When I said that I was thinking about the last dream with my ex.

Even now, why can't I let her go? I see Nymeria in my room, running towards her bed, and wandering sniffing the floor. She goes to grab one of her toys, but stops just before reaching it. She grabs her giraffe and comes to me with her toy on her mouth. She climbs the stairs and stays there. And I watch her and feel so many new emotions. I want to brag about her, show her off. I think about telling all about my dog, my puppy to her. Like those times.

But she's dead. No, she's not. She's different. I'm different, too. And the past is gone.

I returned to bed after breakfast by noon. I let Nymeria climb the bed and put her over my legs. We both fell asleep and I dreamed some other things.

Catherine and I had plans of seeing each other in the US after her work shift. I asked her several times in the morning for confirmation. Finally we decided to cancel it. There is no point, the public transport runs fewer times on Sunday and she'll be tired and time will be scarce.

Next week, probably Monday, I'll go to the library in the university. I do want to study, and actually going and spending on gas might motivate me to not lose my time.

I haven't signed up in the system of the application. Am I scared, nervous? Catherine is right. I am smart, I have good possibilities of doing well on the test and getting in.

Luis asked me if I liked going to Six Flags, if I'd go again were the entrance paid off. I told him no. He asked why and I replied asking him why, will he go? I thought maybe he wanted me to go with him.

He said he won't, he doesn't like big rides. "When will it be?" "Next year, October"

"I won't be here by then... I'll be in Mexico City" and I dared to say it with the security of it being a fact. I said the words out loud as if I were not afraid of cursing my luck. I saw his face and felt guilt. Will I leave him alone? Will I leave Nymeria alone?

What if they need me?

What if I need them?

I will talk with my mom about asking for some money to pay the next laser sessions. Yesterday I shaved to meet my patient and just 24 hours after I already have a black shadow.

My father said Ivan in a really low voice handing me the money of my week. "Did you say something back?", asked Catherine when I told her.

No, I didn't. Will I? I took the money, I need it. As soon as I got yesterday's pay I spent it on a date.

"Do research on the rent and those things, we'll see how we'll deal with it" I don't have to go through everything alone.

Well, yes, but not totally.

I hope.

### 2016-10-16

I have things to do again. My to-do list doesn't have to be empty anymore. Last week, I just remembered, I filled some entries on Wunderlist. Haven't I done anything or did I just forgot?

What is this that I am feeling right now? Is it irritability or sorrow? Am I sad or angry?

I opened YouTube in my tablet as I was lying on bed. Was I looking for something specific? No, I saw in Facebook a picture of Victoria shared by Paloma. I remembered about her procedure of updating her passport. I got into her profile and read the status update of the three transfeminicides that Catherine told me about. The comments were disconcerting. I don't really understand how can they still affect me. I should be accustomed to them by now. They don't say nothing new.

From there I went to the YouTube app and looked her on the search bar. I didn't end on one of her videos. She appeared on the evening news from one of the biggest tv channels of the country. The comments were worse and yet the same. I know them by heart I could categorize them in different types. There are the obvious "trolls" who comment with the sole intention of enraging people, thinking themselves as funny. Then, there are the ones who think they're being respectful and tact, just stating their "personal opinions". They're the first one to get defensive and saying how the LGBT people are the intolerant ones attacking them for asking questions. There are supporters who comment stating how they see the first sane ones or they "respect" their insights and courage of defending "the obvious". Others are the loving supporters who come defending the community.

I don't think I can remember about a single comment that has make me feel better or make the action of reading the comments worth.

Today I slept two hours after Nymeria's breakfast. I was in the living room when my dad left and arrived with the Carl's jr meals and the tacos.

I took the pills. The dispenser is empty. I have no need to go to the pharmacy still. Another day passed and I made no mention of the laser session. Last night I thought about them. I thought about grabbing the phone and calling and setting the appointment in his name. Would I need to consciously make my voice more masculine? How would I go dressed? Would it be uncomfortable, bearable?

Should I come out to them? It's not like men going to depilating their beard is something really common.

Maybe they noticed since the very beginning. Who knows?

Tomorrow I'll go pick up Catherine's patient's file. After that I can make use of the shower and clean change of clothes and go to the library to test the idea of studying in an external place. Tuesday I will take Nymeria to the vet. I told Catherine that I will pick her up with Nymeria and stop at the vet on my way home. From here I can drive her wherever we'll go.

Wednesday I'll see Rene again and Friday I'll meet my patient for the first round of tests.

I don't feel nervous anymore. I do, but not about her. Does it make a difference if she clocks me?

Nymeria is lying on her cushion beside my feet. I left her home, alone in my room for most part of the afternoon. I mopped the floor of my room and felt different about letting her in there.

After breakfast my father asked my mother if she wanted to go to the movies. They told Luis to go shower and get ready. I considered declining their potential invitation. I wanted to stay home, lie in my bed and resting from all the things that I will have to do eventually. Catherine worked today, I guess. She told me to go, it's been a long time since I've gone out with my family. I can't even remember the last time we went out apart of going to the United States. I showered and changed.

I picked one pair of jeans from the lot I took out of the dryer machine. I cut shaving like I hadn't done in a while. A centimeter long crimson line on my cheek. I didn't know what to wear. I have things in my closet, both masculine and androgynous and feminine.

I picked the Mickey t-shirt and the long black cardigan.

In Galerias I looked around thinking I'd see somebody. My mother was the one who saw three different known people.

### 2016-10-17

Today was a long day of nothing.

How am I supposed to fill the daily 750 words if I don't do nothing in the whole day? I could type about my dreams. I had several.

I told Catherine how I knew some of them weren't good yet I could not really remember. I was somewhere where it was supposed to be my house. Relatives were visiting or something like that. They addressed me by an old name. I could talk to Nymeria. She was bigger, was she still a dog? It was time to feed her, and there were other beings in the house, too.

I took Nymeria outside after noticing her sniffing around the floor near her mat. She ran around with a strap of the mop on her mouth. Whenever I would get close to her, she'd slid away running as fast as she can. I would corner her behind the race car Miguel and his team built in high school. I stepped on her strap and took it from her. I opened the door and she would slide through the air rapidly as if she could fly.

I fed her in the morning and tried to stay awake. Even after returning to the bed she would not let me sleep. No, I took her outside and she did her business. I did not talk with Catherine until after. My grandma had left me some eggs in the pan. I ate them and watched some tv before taking my pills. She played a little in the living room until she tired off on her cushion. I slept less than 6 hours in the night, so I was as tired as she was. I woke her up and lead her to my room. I got under the sheets and shared my bed with her. We both fell asleep. It was around ten or eleven o'clock. I put the alarm at 1. I slept and dreamed, and she stayed still by my legs.

Catherine is home by now. She talked with my while her bus arrived. She told me how she felt bad because of certain comments on the weekend. She's ashamed of working in a Carl's Jr. There was something in her issue that I took badly. She's ashamed because she's a graduate. I wanted to console her, give her a new perspective and reason to calm down and be relieved.

We see patients some times, the friend of my mom who's a psychologist told her how she found her first job two years after graduating. I thought about the people on our Facebooks, recently I noticed how they've been changing jobs, going from one to the other. Tere, who was a counselor in a high school, posted about unemployment and then how she had become a teacher. Elena who bragged about being offered a promotion adn then working in an office in the HR department, today posted about her first day being a prefect.

Were they fired or promoted or just offered better opportunities? How can they get several and I none? Us...

I retook our conversation and concluded: don't be desperate. They told us that if we put our own private practice, there would be a couple of years until we had a base clientele.

She replied: you don't get desperate about a job.

It was a spark that kindled my anger. I got conscious about my upsetting.

I explained how it was not just that I could not find one. It's me being transgender, how should I present to the interviews and show my papers and exposed myself to the potential discrimination and mocking.

And then I saw it, she was coming to me, about her job in the united states, how she's getting dollars, but she's ashamed because being a graduate she has a job in the fast food industry.

Where does I that let me? I can't even job in the United States, I have no job and I am a graduate as well. If she's a failure because "what's the point of so much study" then I am a bigger one having never gotten even a single job.

And I tired to console her.

I told her and she answered back with an advice. I should suck up to teachers. Well, later, I could suck up to anyone who gives me an in.

Every time she answers my whining with an advice I feel how she doesn't understand. Why am I worrying if there are so many simple solutions?

Why worry about facing work discrimination and being a vulnerable minority looking for a job? I can just suck it up to people and be fine.

### 2016-10-18

Two more vaccines in a single application next week and her vaccines are done. A reinforcement three months later and then yearly. I guess it's gonna be alright that Nymi can stay in Catherine's house for the weekend. I don't really know why the idea excites me. She staying with her, befriending MuÃƒÂ±eca.

Today was the first day that I'd be leaving the house for different appointments. I woke up before Nymeria. I looked around and turned the lights. She raised her white sharp head and those big black eyes where fixated on me. I had woken from a dream where I was in this same house coming from a different home. At first I was alone in the back seat of a van drove by no one. I climbed to the driver's seat and continued the trip. In some way I got here with both of my brothers. As I told Catherine when I remembered and started retelling it, I came here looking for the Aerostar mini-van that we used to have when we lived in the other house. It served the place of the jetta in my plan of selling it for getting funds to my first months living in Mexico City. My father had driven it and parked here. "It's in the second file of parked cars that gets full when there is a party". It was empty. There was no mini-van in sight. I took out my phone and tried to contact my father. There were some inconveniences with its functions and it wasn't until several tries that I was resigned to the idea that the van was stolen, and so, gone.

I fed the dog and took her out to do her shit. Almost immediately we return and I came back to bed. We both slept for two more hours. The house was silent. Almost empty except by us and my grandma sleeping in her room. I ate a burrito for breakfast that was saved in a kitchen towel. It was a burrito of meat and potatoes. I thought about taking one of the weekend's biscuits, but didn't.

After finishing the season of South Park I took some clothes of the closet and went to the bathroom to take a shower. I put Nymeria in her bed box and closed the door on my room. She stayed quiet for a while, but kept moaning and crying while I shaved my body and washed my hair. As I was shaving my face her laments were almost continues. I tried shushing her and consoling her with my voice but it resulted ineffective. My grandma got out of her room and asked me "are you in the shower?" I was standing in front of the sink with a face lathered and the wet body covered by a tank top and panties. "Yes", I lied although she could completely see me outside of it.

She came down and took her out of the room while I finished rinsing and cleaning the brush and razor.

I hesitated while changing. I put on my pants in the bathroom but didn't know what to wear over. I had thought about the light cream blouse with the scoop neck. As I tried it on, I felt it too tight and a wave of discomfort washed me over as I look the reflection of my whole body. I took out a striped white one and tried it. There was something that felt off still. I changed again to the green one I ended up with. Yesterday was cold, so I realized I would need a jacket or light sweater. I had taken out the long red one but it felt wrong. I tried the black one, but it didn't match with the brown flats. I took the gray one I bought at Target and sent a picture to Cathy.

I changed the sweater to the long black one and the flats to the blacks.

I took Nymi's to Catherine's house and from there I drove to the vet office. We got home and I fed her.

I drove to Lili's where she picked up the file of her next evaluation and she sat in the driving seat on the way to Playas. We got to Argana were we ate and smoked. We stayed there for a while, the waitress welcomed us in the couch of the first floor with a "girls". Does she know I'm trans? The dark skinned one from before we left three years ago does.

We walked on the beach and talked. On our way home we sang to the tunes of the songs on her spotify.

Tomorrow I'll go to the meeting at work and my session and then to the library. Will I register myself finally on the system?

### 2016-10-19

I can't remember the last time I wrote the words out of my house. Was I in Mexicali? Maybe I wrote them in the phone somewhere... Right now I'm sitting in the top floor of the library. I came here to have some free and quiet time dedicated just to study. I guessed that being here would force me to focus and do only the thing I came to do.

I guess I was wrong.

I did not study absolutely anything.

Well, I did transcript the guide to the red notebook, although I haven't decided if I'm going to make the notes on the notebook or use the special notation app of the Laptop. Using the one on the laptop has the benefits of being faster and, of course, way more legible. The notebook has its portability. I can take it here without carrying the two pound laptop.

I went to the meeting with Liliana and her other "girls". It was Friday when I went to attend the last patient and the office was "full". She mentioned it yesterday when Catherine and I picked up the integration of the battery applied to her patient and now today as well.

I noticed the eyes of the other girl, the younger one. Did she notice me? I sensed the changes of my voice and the slips of Lili's "son"s.

Maybe dressing this androgynously wasn't such a good idea.

I had thought about wearing the dark jeans and the stamped half-buttoned-up blouse. I was already clothed when I changed my mind. I put on a plain black t-shirt and over it, the red flannel that I have since I can't remember when. These last days I've been hesitating with my choice of clothes. I feel uncomfortable in them and anxious about the way I look. This time it was unexpected the calmness I felt when I looked myself with this clothes.

The meeting lasted about an hour. We talked about... Have I really just forgotten the topics about the meeting? She mentioned the cups and the coffee area. I gave her the formats and she repeated about the postulations of the possible flyers and ads. We added now the tryouts of a format for a contract of services.

I got in just in time. No, I got in two or three minutes late. Iris, is it? That's her name. She was already there chatting with Liliana. Gilda arrived just some moments after I sat. I got into my car at approximately 12 o'clock. I got into Rene's building half an hour later. I sat at the stairs and just listened to some music and relaxed. This session was calmed. He told me that next week he won't be able to see me. It's alright.

I ate in the cafeteria. It's weird that I know I had intentions of going to the bathroom and yet I haven't gone. Am I scared of entering the women's? I have done it here, haven't I? I entered with Catherine.

I am just two days shy of turning 6 months in hormones. I bought a sandwich and a bottle of water. I told Catherine my idea of buying a wrap from the coffee in the middle of campus. I remembered that I need to give my name after ordering. The cook is those kinds of people that think they're so funny that their sense of humor transcends rudeness.

I got into the library and filled the registration. I made another account of Khan academy. Maybe in there I can review the themes of Chemistry and biology.

Later I can just take out books from here and study at home. Or maybe another day I can come whenever I've felt trapped in my own house or room.

I feel tired. I woke up at 7. Nymeria barked at me but I was still half unconscious. My mind didn't comprehend her intention and I just stared at her. She went out of the plastic box that is her bede and positioned herself on her forelegs lowering her, is it a vagina? A vulva?

She peed in front of my bookcase and I just watch her. I fed her and took her outside. Her anus does look different when she wants to defecate. I can use that to guess and take her outside as training.

We returned to my room and I put an alarm for an hour later. I didn't make use of that time to rest. I couldn't return to sleep.

Maybe now that I've finished today's words I won't have to go late to bed.

### 2016-10-20

Today was another day of emptiness. I woke up early than usual, was it me or was it Nymeria? I fed her and took her outside. I tried to sleep again, but couldn't. Maybe for some minutes, but nothing significant. I'm sitting on the couch typing the words. Legends of Tomorrow is playing on the television. The protagonist of Suits is wearing a superhero costume. In a couple of minutes the second episodes of Supernatural will start. I watched the first one in the morning after growing tired of South Park.

Nymeria is biting the papers over the package of sheets for the printer. I took her to my room. It's tiring. Having to supervise her and watch every move. Maybe that's why I drove to the university yesterday.

I almost forgot my phone. As I was getting all my stuff in my backpack, I was chatting with Catherine over Whatsapp. I put the laptop and the cable, and then the notebook and the pencil bag. Everything was set and I put the backpack over my shoulder. I walked towards the lift and turned seeing if anyone had their eyes on me. I got into the lift and checked my appearance on the mirror. The male shirt didn't overturn the feminity of the rest of the outfit. My face is narrower and sharper, my skin is softer and clearer. I have changed enough.

I got away from the computer and cooked me some chicken in a piece of bread. I've finished now.

Where was I? In the lift. Getting out of the library I looked for my phone. The trousers I was wearing didn't have front pockets and the back ones were empty. The side pockets of the backpack were empty as well but for the water bottle. A flash of fear stomped me. Where could it be? Inside the backpack? I left it behind...

I went inside in a rush, got into the lift and pressed the button. I almost ran to the cubicle where I was seating hoping nobody had noticed it. It was there, on the shelf. I grabbed it and continued the conversation with Catherine.

I had to hit Nymeria again. She's bitting on that self pieces of paper. The folder of papers that my mother left in there. I struck her with the rolled newspaper. Does it hurt? She didn't cry.

I asked Catherine if she has plans for her mother's birthday. That same Saturday is Andrea's party. I can go, it will be late at night. Even if we go out that day, I'll be here by the evening. I looked at the event on Facebook, and specifically the list of guests. Am I scared of being introduced to them? Found out? Last party a year ago, those people weren't so nice and friendly. Will I be under threat?

Just now, remembering last party, I think I'll go. I might stay with Chevo and Jessica. Both Jessica and Paola have confirmed their assistance. I should not depend so much on Catherine. I don't know. I have still a day between now and then.

I've confirmed tomorrow's session, but haven't printed or even planned the tests I'll apply.

The meeting is appointed to tomorrow's evening. I have time, still.

I don't know what I'll wear, neither tomorrow or the day after. I'll wonder about that tomorrow.

Catherine went to work today. In one of her breaks she told me how Anahi would pick her up. Later, she apologized for being late, she said Catherine took her out to eat because both of them were angry. I jokingly told her, that I would cry were they had gone to In n Out. I've been telling her I want to go since months ago. We've postponed going countless times. I remember an imaged I had seen and, continued saying that were they'd gone to 5Guys, I'd commit seppuku.

She asked me what was that, and then played some audios telling me that she would take me to the restaurant after her next paycheck. She would take just me and pay the burger. I noticed how she didn't answer the question and sensed some guilt on her words and voice. I asked her again. And after a third time, she said that they did. She had promised Anahi.

I'd lie if I say I'm not upset. I was sad, I am disappointed.

It's weird because I don't feel my emotions are validated and yet I feel them. I had told her that I would go, but now I don't really want to.

I mean, I still have cravings for that food, but I don't want to go with her.

Is that the reason why I want to stay on the party after her leaving, or even go without her?

### 2016-10-21

"Are you mad at me?"

Was her the first message after hours or was it a reply after mine? Was I mad at her?

I feel something, but what? We talked after I got out of my session. It was the first conversation of more than three consecutive words that we've had since the beginning of the day.

I'm sitting right now at the dinner table, beside my grandmother and with Nymeria by my feet. Deadpool is on the television and Miguel is asleep on the couch.

I woke up a couple of minutes after six. I don't really remember even if I dreamed or not. Catherine texted me she was still asleep or just waking up. I ignored her... No, she answered the last questions I made her last night. She doesn't think she'll go to Andrea's party, she might go out with her mother to dinner, and she'll surely be pretty tired at night. The day after, Sunday, her father had said he had plans of going out to the Valle de Guadalupe. He hadn't confirmed anything. She was planning on asking him, but he was asleep last night.

I answered with and "Ok". I kept thinking about yesterday. I remembered Monica's upsetting when I went to Fuddruckers with Anahi and Catherine some years ago. I thought it was absurd. I had reasons of not going with her. I had offered her taking her, crossing by feet and taking the trolley. She was the on who declined. And now she was mad at me because I went.

What's the difference now? Catherine had invited me times before and I declined. I used the money as an excuse. I am in not place for spending the few dollars I have. Anahi took her. They had an opportunity and took it. I have no right to be mad nor upset.

But I still am.

Maybe that's why I don't say anything. But keeping those feelings to me only makes things worse.

Miguel sent me a message in the morning asking if I went out or were busy. Could I pick him up from school? He uses the feminine with me. I remember the time he asked my grandma about me, using my name.

The only one left is my dad. He used Ivan way more times before. I guess he is taking the idea. It's been 6 months since I started hormones. Half a year to take the idea. Three months, maybe, after I went public. Have the relatives from his side said anything to him about me? Some didn't add me right after, the closer ones, actually.

We have gone to Mexicali just a couple of times, but I haven't seen anyone from that side of the family in a long time.

This weekend is Andrea's party. Next Tuesday I'll have the third session with my patient and the day after I won't have mine. Later that same day is the birthday of Diego, Paola's son. I should go buy him a gift or something. Maybe we'll go to the United States.

I don't know what else to write about. I could scan the papers to upload them to the site. I am finally registered. I started studying math again in the Khan site. For now just reviewing the early and easy subjects of algebra and geometry, things of middle school and high school. It's a little disconcerting how I passed most of the Math classes with perfect A's and yet I barely remember how to do most of those things.

They are part of the syllabus of the test so I'm not really wasting my time.

Statistics is another of the next subjects in Khan and the most important subject in the psych test and a significant one of the Science one.

The time is shorter than what I imagine. The first test is by mid February, just a month an a half after new year's, which is a little more than two months from now.

Will I do it? Will I be able to?

Will I survive?

Most of the people I know have a master's. The grown ones I mean. No, that's not true. Not most of them, most of the teachers, but that's a biased view.

Why am I scared? I've talked this with Rene. It's not a condition anymore for the procedure of changing the name. Why am I still preoccupied with my ability and results.

Because it's my future.

I wasn't able to imagine me now. Maybe that's why I am scared. Because I am wandering blind.

### 2016-10-22

Catherine is out with her parents celebreting her mom's birthday. They are on a Chinese food buffet. She sent me some messages a couple of minutes ago. We didn't talk much today.

I woke up early in the morning, so that I had to wait before feeding Nymeria. I did try to sleep again but she did not let me. My father went out and brought breakfast. Luis did not ask for anything, There were four biscuits, a burger, crisscuts fries and a bag of hash browns in the paper bag. I assumed the biscuit were for my mom and grandma, and the burger for Miguel. What would Luis eat? He came down before Miguel and I hadn't finished my food yet. I asked him and he said he didn't ask for anything.

I guess I was pretty hungry. I didn't even hesitate before deciding to eat two of my biscuits. My grandma and mother came down and I was already in my room when they ate. They asked Luis what did he crave but he answered nothing. My grandma insisted over and over, suggesting him meals she could make him. After several failed tries, she told him she would make it anyway in case he did want it. I felt like screaming even though she wasn't talking to me and I wasn't even in the room.

My mother got angry and sent him to his room.

A while later, when I went upstairs for some reason, I passed beside their rooms and saw her standing in theirs with his arms surrounding her. I looked for more than an instant, so their hug was continuous. Was he crying? Did he confess something?

Catherine went to work. She will have unpredictable shifts all November and December because of the high needs of personnel. They let her out early.

Yesterday Gilda posted that there were two patients available for evaluation. Iris should contact her about the info of one and the other, which was looking for a vocational orientation, could be taken by either me or Catherine. In other conversation I asked her if I could have her. It was more like a courtesy. She has her job with a constant wage, her shifts are chaos and we've been talking about my need of money and economic pressure. She agreed.

I said I would take it and Gilda replied questioning me if I wanted her contact or should she give her mine. I hesitated. Should I ask for it so I'd have the control over contacting her? Or was it easier just letting her have it and waiting for their initiative. I opted for the latter.

Even this morning I wasn't sure about going to Andrea's party. I didn't. It wasn't much that Catherine wouldn't be there. I don't think I'd be very comfortable. Sure there would be new people who'd see me and I could sense their perception about me. But some of them I've met already. They saw me in a black skirt and cape, last year. I didn't like them much. What if Andrea hesitated introducing me to them? What if she told them? Is it ok me being scared of them knowing? Or was it more their attitude and personalities after a few drinks?

I think about my closet and clothes. Yesterday I had my patient. I applied some tests. I changed before picking Miguel up and put make up before having the session. I wore another male shirt over the blouse. Was I feminine enough? Did I felt comfortable enough?
I need more clothes, the season has changed. Soon, the climate will as well. Most of my clothes are short-sleeved and I lack jackets.

Luis told my father he needed to buy pants. He didn't have many or needed more or I don't remember what. My father asked him from where does he want them. "The United States". I asked if we'll go but didn't get a definite answer. It would be perfect if we went. I could buy some of the clothes I need and look for Diego's present for his party this Wednesday. I already proposed Catherine about giving him a gift from the both of us.

I counted the money after my father gave me the three green notes. This time he said no name and I thanked him silently. I have a little more than two thousand pesos and like ten dollars. I could use that money to buy the laser sessions myself.

I hadn't said nothing to my mother and the month is almost over. I would benefit lots of them, why am I bothered by the thought about them?

Oh, because it means using the phone and introducing myself as Ivan again.

### 2016-10-23

I don't feel much like typing, writing. My mind feels blank. I haven't slept since waking up in the morning. Nymeria wakes me for breakfast and stays active the first couple of hours of the day. After that, she fells into this kind of tired and slow state. She lets herself down on my legs or her cushion or sometimes even the floor. I envy her and resent her a bit.

I reviewed some early math subjects. Two or three chapters before finishing algebra. Geometry, trigonometry and then Statistics and Calculus, the things I should be learning.

It's unheartening, how most of the stuff I'm reviewing are things I've supposedly have learned already.

I haven't even started with biology and chemistry or physics.

Catherine was going to go to Ensenada, or Valle de Guadalupe or somewhere... We talked a little in the morning. I guess I was the first person to get up in the house. Luis came later and asked if my dad had brought breakfast. It was close to 9 in the morning. He wanted to wake him up. Yesterday he declined food and now he was about to wake him. I told him to wait. Moments later Grandma came down. Did she eat something? She offered him food.

Miguel and my father were next. My dad asked us if we wanted anything. My mother came down until after he returned.

Yesterday I saw an episode of Black Mirror. San Junipero. It was about a woman visiting this coast town in the 80's. In there she met another woman who was more accustomed to the region. The grow intimate and you see their relationship flower.

San Junipero is a town, but not one of any kind. They see each other after every week in this bar. Kelly is young and out-going, with black curly hair and dark skin. Yorkie is shy and cautious, her hair is light brown and her big eyes stay hidden behind big glasses. The finally get together and spent the night. Well, until midnight, anyway.

Next week, Yorkie can't find her. So she looks for her in different times.

They agreed to meet outside San Junipero. Kelly will visit her from Nevada to California. They get to know each other and marry. She helps her get her euthanasia.

I put the second episode of Falling water, but I can't seem to remember what happened on the first one. I guess I'll take it off. I didn't pay much attention the first time. Now, that I'm writing it's a lost cause. I am putting on instead Saturday Night Life. I don't have to see it, I can just hear the skits and pretend I'm caring.

Nymeria is tiring me. She keeps biting me every time I try to grab her.

My father took my mom to a concert in Cecut. She'll see a ballet recital where the daughter of her friend is gonna perform. My father just now is unlocking the front door. Nymeria ran to meet him and welcome him.

My next session will be before Friday. She said she would confirm Saturday. I guess I'll send her a text tomorrow asking for the time.

I registered for a conference Tuesday afternoon, but after seeing that they'll use my microphone and videocamera. I thought about unregistering, I was scared. What if they expected me to talk or say something? It's improbable and yet, I still don't know if I'm going to take it.

Wednesday will probably be free. No. I have Paola's reunion. Her son's birthday.

I'm still a hundred and fifty words left and I feel mentally exhausted. I studied most of the morning. Math is mentally consuming. But what I did should not count as math. It's elementary school leveled exercises. I should feel ashamed of struggling with simple algebra of middle school.

Catherine didn't go to the place she was gonna. They went to Playas, and after that to the house of somebody's grandma who has a birthday, too.

Tom Hanks is introducing the show, he's making a skit about being the father of America after being named "America's Dad". He put on a sweater and sat beside the chimney to have a talk.

I hear him and wonder about my own father. Would he sit and talk with me like that? Chat and try to understand what's happening to me. What has happened and what will. What will I do, how do I feel. How am I taking it.

Why don't I go and sit with him.

Is he scared, too?

### 2016-10-24

I remember always having a computer. Since before I could write there has always been a computer in my house. I was an only child in pre-school when I would enter into the "lil room" and play that game of a skiing man running away from a Yeti. It was always that end, when the Yeti appears and eats you and it's a sudden death. Game Over. That's it.

Lots of people grew with that name. I remember once reading on the internet someone saying how it was an allegory of the inevitability of death, and the finite nature of life. To later know about the person who later appeared with the knowledge that pressing some button you get the acceleration you need to avoid his grasp.

When did I got my computer? The PC in the lil room was my father's. Once I bought some food that came with a complimentary cd of a videogame. I was unable to play it because the computer had no CD-drive. Just floppy disks. We used those in grade school in the computers class to save our work and give homework.

I fantasized about having a laptop. I don't really know what was exactly what I fancied in them. I imagined myself taking it with me to Mexicali, to coffee shops, walking to other rooms, maybe sitting in the stairs and working on something. Writing? Reading? What did I use a computer for in those times?

I saw one in Costco once. It was a UMPC. Ultra Mobile PC. It was 10 inches wide. I didn't care about the specs or what I could use it for. I wanted it. I had the intention of saving money and buying it.

Years passed and I got into Macs. I think it was a movie about a scriptwriter working on one. I was already in High School? No, Middle School. I saved some money and my mother helped me with the rest. That was my first laptop. This is the second. The first one's hard drive failed and its battery started inflating. Instead of trying to repair it, my father bought me this one. I have six years with it.

I used it to write the scripts of the shorts of high school. I used it to edit the videos I made for my friends. I took it to Spain with me and talked to my family and friends through its screen. I've been writing these words this whole time in here.

Why did I started talking about computers? I remembered the scene of my imagination with the computer resting on my lap and my fingers tapping the keyboard. I used to try to imagine myself in the future. In grade school once when we returned from the US with my godmother and Jessica, my mother parked besides the middle school. We all talked about schools, their uniforms. The different colors of the jumpers depending on the grade of the girl and the boringness of the shit-colored boys' one. In high school, on the other hand, the skirt was nice and the boys wore jeans and a white polo. It was like wearing no uniform. To my child mind it was unimaginable. Jeans, not wearing uniform, going in your normal clothes.

By then I already had dreams about wearing a girl's uniform. I didn't think of them in that conversation. I tried imagining me wearing the khakis pants and shirt, or the jeans and polo. Even when I bought the first ones and tried them on, seeing myself in the mirror was weird. That was the way I would look for the next three years.

The thought of wearing a jumper never really crossed my mind.

In grade school I once had to do a homework where I had to draw myself as an adult. I put glasses on myself even though by then I didn't need them. There was something in me that knew they would be a part of me. I drew me with short hair although, by then, I already despised having it that way.

My life is immensely different to what I could had imagined. Lots of changes and things have happened.

And even now, after all that's happened, after living in Europe and finishing college, having a girlfriend and knowing the pain of a broken heart, being dumped and breaking up a relationship, juggling the hearts of two people, transitioning and coming out, being in a lesbian relationship... Even now I can't imagine what's going to happen next.

### 2016-10-25

I am worse than I thought. I am home with Luis by my side and Nymeria between my feet.

This day started really early. I woke up a couple of minutes past seven and feed the dog. There was a plate covered with a napkin left on the table. I was hungry. Was that for me? The red car was still in the parkway. There was nothing behind it but the empty street through the house in front of ours. My mom was still here but my brothers not.

My grandma asked me if I saw the burritos she left for me. I asked which were they. I asked again after not being heard. Those weren't mine after all. She handed them to me and I ate them so my stomach wasn't empty receiving my pills. Miguel turned behind me and asked me if I'd go out early, if I could take him to school by 9, 9 and a half.

Sure, why not. I didn't return to bed and I haven't rested since then.

I am in my pajamas after taking my clothes off. I thought about staying in the tank top and just putting over a hoodie. Two days ago there were some clothes on the couch, some of my father's pants and Luis' shirts or something. When she took them upstairs, my gray hoodie was with them. I put the other darker and thicker one but it was too much. Yesterday it rained, storm-like. Today I decided to wear the gray hoodie I bought at Target. Were it going to rain again or just be chilly it would be ok.

I went upstairs and my grandma was already lying on her blankets reading her ipad. The question of the location of the sweater didn't reach her ears. Again, I threw my words at her. And again I missed. Almost screaming I made myself be heard. I didn't found it and irritated came down and just put on a long-sleeved t-shirt. Still it isn't cold but by the middle of the night it refreshes.

I showered, shaved my body and almost drowned in nausea. I remember the time where I stepped out of the shower to throw up in the toilet before a cancelled plan with Catherine. Was this going to be like that?

It wasn't.

I changed and combed my hair and put make up on. I'll go take it off. Whatever is left, I mean.

So I took Miguel and Nymi by the same time. I grabbed my portfolio with the tests and my purse and told Miguel to get into the car. The last week, when I took Nymeria, she threw up on her box over the brown t-shirt. It could had been the heat. This earlier time it could be less probable that she'd get carsick. I was wrong.

She threw up when I left Miguel in the Tech. Then again after I moved her to the front seat. Before getting to the 7eleven to buy a soda, on the lights behind, actually, a person asking for money for a rehabilitation center approached my window. He addressed me in the feminine from the start. He called me m'ija and pretty when he asked me for money. "Can I sing you a son, beautiful?"

I told him I had no loose change. In the vet there was a different receptionist. I annotated our names in their sheet and sat to wait. 10, 15, 20 minutes passed. I was annoyed, sick, tired. I wanted to get home and rest. I am here now and I still need to rest.

I came home and tried to rest for the hour before my second time to leave. I got to the office and saw my patient walking upstairs with another person. Was she a patient of Lilli? just a friend of hers? I saw the closed door of the office and remembered I never told Liliana that I'd see the patient today.

I called her and told me she was in traffic. It was alright.

My patient introduced us. Her friend extended her hand and I reached her. Something crushed. Arantza looked at her and asked. "Oh, no, it wasn't me, it was he ...she" She apologized but I didn't realized if it was because of the misgendering or the hands. I apply the test and the hour went flying. Nymeria was already shot and I was already out. Catherine bought the present for Diego so I could go pick it up.

Getting there I parked ahead of where I usually do. Catherine told me there was ringbell after I sent her the message. And passing the door she added her uncle was home, so she didn't know how would he address me.

Was that it? I got inside and felt sick. I felt sad and dark. I was in pain.

Anahi would be getting there soon. In the way there, Catherine told me they were just sitting on the table but she could invite me a taco or something. When I got there, I lost my appetite.

I sat on the couch and she asked me several times how I felt. I told her I did not know. Didn't I? Why didn't I tell her I was in pain? I didn't know why, or even what exactly was tormenting me.

She asked me if I wanted to stay. I thought of Anahi and shook my head with tears in my eyes. I noticed how she was annoyed. "I thought we could just stay here, chat, do something.

I just wanted to lie down and cry.

Anahi got there and I did just that on her shoulder. Minutes later I said good-bye and came home.

I don't know if I'll go tomorrow to the party.

I don't know what's wrong with me.

### 2016-10-26

I haven't gone still to the pharmacy. I have until Saturday to buy the pills. I should be starting grading the tests or studying for the tests. Should I mention to them my application to the masters? I saw them. I went. Catherine did as well.

I showered in the morning. No, it was the afternoon. Yesterday I went to bed early with the weight of misery on my back and shoulders. A couple of hours later, before midnight still, I woke up in the darkness thinking it was a new day. I checked Catherine's unread message and realized I was wrong. Did I dreamed something today? I know I did. I thought about mentioning. Yeah, school. Something about a dance? It was grade school, again, but I wasn't a child. I stepped down the stairs in some type of costume. Was it a festival? I saw several of the girls I've known wearing red dresses. Other were in a suit, gray slacks and a fitted cocktail coat. Was Catherine among them?

I fed Nymeria and came out to the living room. My grandmother was cutting fruits or vegetables for her drink. There was no burritos, yet. I sat tired in the couch. Thinking about the day. The party of Diego would not start until three and a half. I ate the two burritos my grandma made me. My mother left for school. Grannie offered me another two, and I accepted, but ate only one.

Nymeria was tired of running and playing and started falling asleep on my lap. Or was it her cushion? I thought about going to the room and sleeping some more.

I woke up two hours later. Was it noon? Something like that. I showered and changed. I put on the black blouse with the white vest.

I was ready for leaving. I could buy the bag or something for the gift on the way. When would it be too early? When would it be too late? I waited until the appointed time on the Facebook event to leave home. I bought the gift bag and drove to her house. I stepped down and went to the front door. I called her on whatsapp and then to her phone. After a couple of minutes I decided to return to my car and wait.

She called me back and told me she would open the door. I stepped in and everyone was home already, helping in the kitchen. I felt a little embarrassed about coming this late. On my way up I had seen Carlos, Diego's father putting on the decoration in the room under the building.

It wasn't long until Catherine arrived as well. There was some of Paola's friends. I approached Carlos' cheek when he said hello. He knows about me, I guess. Paola told her mom "Sofia got here", I guess she knows, too.

Her childhood friend?

Like when I saw my patient, as we were playing that game were you have to guess what is written on the paper in your forehead only using yes or no questions, Carlos hesitated before addressing me.

It was Jessica's turn to play, but she approached him to put the paper on his forehead and he said: "No, it's hi...her turn"

They correct themselves. Shouldn't that be good enough?

I took out the phone just moments before the game would end. Catherine sent me a text asking me what I was doing minutes later.

"I don't feel good. Anxiety, maybe?" She replied how she was just thinking about leaving herself. We both said our goodbyes.

We both got into Cathy's car and she took me to mine. We used to do that when we were in College. Sometimes we would park on different parts of the lot, and we'd go to the closest car, or usually hers and stay and chat. Then, when the time to leave would come, she would take me to my car and each of us would go their way.

I talked to myself on my way home. At first I rehearsed the speech I would give about being trans. How it wasn't really something I've known my whole life. But I didn't really changed my gender. Will somebody some day ask me about it? Do I want to?

I wished no one could see or notice. I wished it would be actually a secret that I could keep and just disclose to the people I want.

I am just six months on hormones. And from here on, I will be changing more and more.

Time will pass.

### 2016-10-27

So today. Since yesterday I've known that I would take Miguel to his school. I woke up by six in the morning to feed Nymeria. I took her outside like all of the mornings. My mom was still upstair getting ready. Only females were in the house. Do I count myself? I hesitated before writing the sentence. Nymeria and me, my mother and grandmother.

I don't recall dreaming something. I slept maybe six hours. Grannie still hadn't made breakfast.

Like ten times today, my grandma has called me son. Every time is harder and more painful. I don't understand why can't I say something or correct her. A burning rage is boiling in my guts. I want to say something, scream...

It's not her fault, it's not on purpose. My mother had corrected her before.

It doesn't matter.

I stayed awake for some minutes in the couch waiting for the time to come and take Miguel to school. Nymeria was running and playing and, as usual, came to my legs and fell asleep. Nothing happened, I guess.

My mother is talking about her colleague, the one who was jealous of me in Facebook, the one with mommy issues. I hear them and feel, I don't know... It's like if they were girls in middle school talking about giving the silent treatment.

Yesterday in the child party of Diego, I noticed how he is really immature. He spend half of the party in arms, being Paola's or his father's. He had the pacifier in his mouth and I didn't hear him say not a single word. By the time of the pictures he covered himself in his firefighter hat and then fell asleep before the second half.

I told Catherine how I have this weird feelings about it. I should not care about the way she raises him. It's none of my business, they're not even family.

On the way home from the party I thought about having a conversation with my ex. Again, another one.

Why do I keep dreaming about her? It's not even that we make peace or reconcile. In my dreams I see her message, I see our conversation and I'm surprised and shocked. "Why are we talking? Why are you looking for me?"

"I wished I could stop thinking about you. Why can't I let you go? It's not that I want you back. I'm sure I don't love you. I don't care about not ever seeing you again, but... what is it that I want then? I wished I could hate you, sometimes I enlist all of the things that you did or failed to do, all of the things that would made anyone tell me that I am better without you. And not even then do I wish you wrong.

I miss talking to you, knowing how you're doing, what's happening in your life and sharing mine. I miss you.

And I hate it."

I feel pathetic. I came back from Miguel's school and on the way thought about the messages that were in the conversation of the gang. Paola thanked us about being with her, accompanying her and helping. They talked about it, said that maybe Paola can help for the next party when Chevo and Jessica have a child, they talked playfully about the future. And those hopeful talks hurt this time. Even the talk about the plan for next year's, even the wedding of Andrea.

I, hopefully, won't be close for them.

It's sure now, I've applied. The plan is set. I will go to the capital in three months. It can either be for two years or for a couple of months. Would it be a failure not getting in and coming back? Would I look for a job if I don't get into any of the masters?

How would I feel with myself?

I should not think about that. Even in the couple of months I am supposed to be there I can deal with the papers and change my name. Just doing that would be a victory and an accomplishment.

Step by step. Sometimes it doesn't help to look at the full picture. Everything as it comes.

What's the point of asking to myself: "Will I make it?", if I haven't even finished the first steps. Take each thing one at a time.

My mother brought something that I had left behind. Last night before going to bed, she came and told me how the principal of Luis school's told her he talked to his school psychologist about "doubts about his sexuality".

Did I write about this yesterday?

Am I repeating myself?

Am I trapped in yet another cycle of anxious rumination?

### 2016-10-28

I think it was a week ago, when Catherine first told me she had thought about going out today. Yesterday I think I wrote how my grandma called me "son" like 20 times. There was something that made me feel like shit as the day began. Nymeria barked at me and the lights were still off, the Sun itself was still off. It was too early still to feed her, yet I had not the patience and fed her anyway. Even I ate and took my pills.

I wasn't out of my room for more than three minutes when my grandma addressed me as M'son. Irritated, "I am not 'son'", I exclaimed and walked away. I think she did not hear me. Less than five minutes later she called me the same way again. She laughed just after. Was she because she realized her mistake? Or was it something completely different related to the thing she wanted to tell me in the first place?

I don't know and I won't ask.

Tomorrow the weekend will begin. I'm home after going out with Catherine. Miguel is asleep on the couch next to the one where I'm sitting. My grandma is doing something in the kitchen while Nymeria observes carefully.

I've given the big blouse I bought mistakenly in a Large size. More than a blouse it's a tunic, but similar to the red flannel shirt I wore today.

Yesterday when we were thinking and planning what we could do today, she proposed going to the Plaza between our homes, the one with the fun park and the mini-golf and the Bowling. In the morning I tried to go back to bed after finishing the last episode of Black Mirror. Nymeria stayed for a while in her bed-box and I could sleep. I dreamed about something, there I was in a car driven by my father. Out of home, the closest under-bridge was different. It was a sort of rock tunnels, deep, complicated and narrow. After there, I was with Catherine wandering in an indoors Mall, going through different stores. I was wearing a red dress and felt vulnerable. Some time later, we ended in the line for a bathroom.

I woke up. The darkness trapped between the closed doors made it even more difficult to stay awake and get up. Catherine had sent me a message that she'd have to go to the United States to the bank and take some money out of the ATM. She explained that we would not need to cancel our plans.

I wasn't conscious enough to even worry. I got out of the bed and went to the bathroom to get ready. I put on the black jeggings and the red flannel shirt. Almost the same outfit I wore to the University.

She would pick me up by three. When I got out of the shower she was already at her home. As she picked me up she told me how she would have to go first to an AT&T to pay her bill and from there we could go to the restaurant. She told me if I wanted to go to the movies, River Plaza, we could see the Dr Strange movie.

We went to the cell place and an employee welcomed us at the front door. Everyone today used feminine pronouns. She drove to the Plaza and we got into the Giusseppi's. The waiter sat us and after a while came for our order. We asked four all of our dishes before the drinks. As he finished taking our order he stayed and looked straight at me with a smile on his face and opened his mouth to ask me something. I cringed and waited for the worst.

"Are you, it's your voice, when you spoke, I mean, are you still a lady? Because, I mean, you look young, but your voice sounds deep and..."

I smiled uncomfortable and just mumbled yes. Catherine answered back that, yeah, I'm young despite my voice.

He brought us our food and everything went fine. We walked through different stores and looked at stuff waiting for our movie. We would be seeing it in 4D.

In the movie theater, getting up the escalator I watched a woman climbing the stairs. I moved to the side so she could pass. After some moments she took the cue and walked past us. "Thank you, girls", she said. Then, as she ordered her Tostitos and I stood in line for a bottle of water, the man behind me, told to his wife "I'm behind her (esta)... After her, then it's me."



### 2016-10-29

I don't remember the last time I sat here in my desk and typed the words. Is it more than a week?

The laptop has been having issues. I broke Miguel's can shaped glass because of it. I feel guilty about it. I was with him when he bought it. I imagined how I would feel had he broken my Mason mug. Nymeria is running with her giraffe on her mouth. I took her out of the desk irritated after dealing with the problematic laptop.

Maybe I should make use of the opportunity and play with her. Maybe that could help me with my mood.

I went outside and ran with her. We ran besides each other. I ran behind her trying to reach her. I ran ahead and made her bark when she could not follow my steps. I ended exhausted and sitting on the floor. I was sweating when came back inside and lied on the couch to catch my breath.

Edgar and his friends would come any moment. I heard the voice of my mother mention his name. Luis came down the stairs almost immediately. "My mom says that you go and open the door to Edgar and tell him to put the car on the visits' parking space" I went to my purse for the keys and felt a sudden pulse of anxiety in my spine. What if they see me? What will they say or think? They will recognize me and think I'm a weirdo or a faggot.

I gave him the keys. "You go". He asked me to accompany him. "You go, why do you want me?" "I don't know what to say to him." I gave him no answer and went to my room. I heard their voices get closer and closer. I was trapped, again, in my room. Some minutes passed before I took the courage to open the door and go outside. Edgar said hi. I approached him with my hand extended, but he hugged me. His friends, one was sitting in the table and the other one was in the restroom. When he came out he just saw me and smiled cordially.

They came to the Oktoberfest. I caught the word in their conversation and remembered last week that I could not go. Didn't they know?

I opened my mouth and turned my thoughts to words. They were sure they had read it was supposed to be the 29th. After some laughs and reconsideration of their plans, they decided to go to the Plaza.

Miguel is there right now as well. We were in the mail when he told my dad he was going to go out this evening. He and his friends would meet at the house in La Cacho and from there would they go to The Plaza in front of Plaza Rio.

The line wasn't long but it was tedious. We were like 20 cars behind the booth when it stopped completely for 10 or 15 minutes. I started thinking what could happen when we reached the officer, what kind of questions would they ask or comments. Would he made a mention about me?

Cars started passing and advancing. And then, somehow, we stopped at the booth and the officer was a woman and for a moment I was relieved. As if a woman was less probable to take offense about my being. She took the cards and made the usual questions while she reviewed the pictures in them. She paired the pictures silently one by one. I knew the order of the credentials because I was the one that took them out of their sleeves and passed them to my dad. Dad, Mom, me and brothers. She looked at my dad and from there passed to my mom. It was my turn and her face turned to the seats of the back. I was the one closest to the window and to her. She passed the cards and asked Luis to move back to see Miguel. She saw all of the three cards confused. Then she asked out loud. "Jose?" And I raised my hand as if confessing a shameful crime. "You are?" and then said the names of my brothers and just let us go.

We ate at Denny's. From there my dad took us to Target where the bill surpassed the five hundred dollars. I bought a purple top and a dark red blouse. I tried some formal pants but none fit. My mom asked me how the make up turned out. I told him it was alright. And she asked back if I needed anything else from there. I said no, but then ended up buying a lip pencil, mascara and a concealer.

I took a picture of my red lips matching the blouse. I see me smiling and remembered me imagining how would I look when I transitioned.

This is the picture of me at 6 months of hormones. This is me.

And even as I type this, I can't help but smile again.

### 2016-10-30

And so another day is close to ending. Just one day for one more month to pass. Two more and the year is over. A week after its beginning did I finally call to make the hormones appointment. Here I am thinking, planning, preparing for the next step of my life. My master, my change of name are the things that are ahead.

Tomorrow would be the day that Anahi and Catherine would go to the United States in costume to, I don't know, do something. I wanted to go, I want to. I see everybody's pictures of them in disguise and I feel envious. It's scary just to think about crossing the border. Catherine is right. She told me how she can imagine what I feel or fear. It's crossing with papers with another name and appearance, to somebody whose job is specifically to assess and judge me.

I had decided not going. And some hours ago Catherine sent a message telling me how they had changed their minds and instead would go to the Macro Plaza at night. She would be asking to leave early, but would see us maybe by 9.

I woke up in the early morning, an hour before time for Nymeria's feeding. I turned off the lights again ignoring her. It was way to early. I went and returned from slumber. After feeding I opened the door and carried her with the intention of not waking any of our house guests. Did I sleep again after that?

I remember hearing their voices and my mother and grandma preparing breakfast. I opened the door and headed out, dreading my grandma's "son" callings. Would I look suspicious in my pajamas? They are not overtly feminine.

Nobody said anything about it. I sat and ate with them.

The chatted at the table after finishing their plates. I, on the other hand, moved to the couch putting some distance between me and them. Andres is the name of the taller one. His hair is lighter and longer. El Pollo is the oldest and shortest of them. He's the teacher. Elementary school is where he works.

They talked about school and dealing with a special kid. The talked about the gym and the breakfast, their age and appearances. When they mentioned the beards I noticed something. El Pollo, doesn't grow a beard. He doesn't even need to shave according to them. He's young looking and mistaken for a child sometimes. They told about the time when the three of them were 22 but seen as 28, 22 and 14, respectively.

His body is gynecoid in form. He has wide hips and a voluminous behind compared to the rest of his body. His hips are actually wider than his shoulders. Does he have an hormone imbalance? That would be actually really probable. I thought about mentioning to my mother, but decided against it. What's the point?

If they did notice about me, he was the one most probable to have clocked me. When they left, Edgar hugged me but I extended my hand to them.

I thought about starting grading the tests today. It's ten o'clock and I have barely even opened the folder with the tests.

Tomorrow I guess I'll go out with both Catherine and Anahi. I don't have to worry about the costume anymore. I don't have to worry.

I should had done the tests. Instead I spent most of the day on the couch resting and reading. I'm a third, no, more like a fourth, behind finishing the book I've been reading. I haven't studied anything though. Maybe I go to school in the week to actually study or do something in there. I haven't gotten to familiarize with the notational app.

Melissa talked to me yesterday. In the morning she sent me a message asking how I've been. We chatted for a while about our recent lives. She's been busy and I got a little jealous. When I mention my plans it seems as if I've actually been doing something.

In paper I look busy and interesting. I've been transitioning hormonally this last year, I'm applying to these master programs, gathering the papers for the processes and studying for their tests. And I've been seeing this patients for evaluations on the side to gather some money.

Anyway, she was the first person outside Anahi and family that I told about leaving in february to the Capital. She told me how she knows this person who works in a NGO that deals with trans people. She thought about mentioning me so I could participate in a forum or something. It would be really cool.

I agreed with her and told her I was in.

Would this actually lead to something? Or will it be like those patients that say they're interesting but I never heard of them?

### 2016-10-31

I'm all dressed up and ready. I should go upstairs and tell my parents I'm about to leave. We're going to Macroplaza to get a coffee or drink something. Maybe TGI Friday's or Applebees or something like that. Why am I nervous? I won't have to go through Customs border nor any CBP officers. Nobody is going to judge my appearance.

I think I'll order an uber. Anahi and I will meet before Catherine, although she's going to check out in less than an hour.

I'm Batgirl, but brunette. I started grading some tests and put the first episode of Chance, where House is a neuropsychiatrist called Chance. I didn't finish it.

I woke up early and fed Nymeria. After the usual early mornin routine I went back to sleep and she went straight to her box. A couple of hours later I woke up and ate my breakfast. Then, after seeing yesterday's episode of Westworld I slept some more. I was tired, I still am.

I didn't send the message to my patient confirming tomorrow's meeting. I don't know at what hour I'll see her. It's still early. I could send a message right now or even tomorrow morning.

I put on some make up, even eye shadow. I sent a picture to both Catherine and Anahi, the latter told me I looked good, a little thinner.

I don't know what else to write. It's like the last few days have been slimmer or voider.

Should I cheat right now? Tomorrow I would have to write double.

I've ran out of ideas and I'm not even halfway. I could take a picture of myself and post it to Facebook. That's what I wanted to do, didn't I?
That's the whole point. I wanted to show myself, to be seen and do what everybody else has been doing. I want to be social and do something.

I opened up my cellphone and went to instagram. Did I had her in mind before I opened the app or was her thought a kind of reflex? I looked at her profile. Catherine told me some weeks ago that her profile keeps showing up in the list of people she might know, her latest posts as well. I got there and saw her latest post. She looks different. It's not like she has changed. I just recognized her less and less every time. She is reclined on some kind of fence wearing a short brown sweater. "I have no tits" is the description of her picture.

Do I have more than her? Was that the intention of her only question when I told her I would start Hormone Treatment? Envy? Fear that I, somehow, would end up more feminine than her? No. I don't think it's that.

The phone has vibrated. I guess it's Anahi telling me she's ready.

I am nervous and a little scared.

I cheated but returned to actually finished the words. It wasn't my phone that vibrated. I guess it was Luis'. I've gone upstairs and told them how I would be leaving in some minutes. It's going to be eight o'clock. It is eight now. Will it be too late when we get there? What if it is too dangerous? I won't be taking my car. I'll ask for an uber. Myabe on the way home Catherine could take me? No, I guess she's going to be tired. I could just ask for another uber back. My phone should be charged enough. She'll be leaving in a couple of minutes. Maybe we'll get there by the same time. Why should things go wrong? Why am I still worried or thinking about the chances of something going foul?

I ought to calm down. I wanted this, I asked for this.

Everything is going to be alright. The words are done and I even did some exercises on Khan Academy to maintain the streak.

I wish Catherine wouldn't have to work, that she could had come with us since the beginning. Am I just envious? Why did I have to accept going out? I had cancelled already. Anahi is ready. Maybe I should go now?

It is still early. I know where will we be going but I don't know what we're going to do. It's hard going out the three of us because I worry that ANahi is not having a good time. I don't know what she wants to do and she doesn't give options. When we decide and do something I don't know if she's enjoying herself. Maybe I am a little nervous because of that. It's going to be just the two of us for a while.


## November, 2016

### 2016-11-01

For a minute here I thought yesterday's words had not been saved. I saw the last empty box below the month of October and my heart skipped a beat. Could it be again that I would lose unintentionally the streak of more than a hundred days? Again all this effort thrown away, even after all I went through yesterday, cheating and then working up to the quota in the time before my parting.

After refreshing the page and returning I saw the complete set of the 31 checked boxes. And in this white page, up there rests the 30 next empty yet-to-be-filled white squares.

Do I write about yesterday's night or today's day?

I left home when Anahi told me to meet in the plaza just minutes after Catherine sent a message that she was off her shift. I wore my costume outside my home. This was the third time that I was disguised with the black skirt outside my home and the first time that I was seen in it by the people that live with me.

I waited outside for the red Uber car to pick me up. There were groups of people supervising children marching in their disguises door to door in the look for candies. Some saw me; other's sights stayed in me for longer. A mother passed and left behind a "good afternoon".

The car arrived and took me to my destination. I was earlier and I waited. I hide my face in my phone in the conversation with Anahi. I walked towards the Starbucks, our meeting place. I decided not to enter yet. The two closest benches were occupied so I walk to the third. To a side there was a Torta restaurant guarded by person inside a big Torta costume. I sat and he looked at me, although I could not see his eyes. He got closer and closer until he was just by my side. A kid approached us and extended his hand to salute him. He answer his call and return his pretended face towards me. In an awkward state of nervousness I invited him to sit. He took my invitation. More and more children came and surrounded us. One mother asked me if his son could take pictures with him. I guess she thought I was with him. I stood and after a couple of minutes and children, I left.

Anahi got there and ordered a coffee with me. Mine was a tea and hers a green frappe. We were chatting about stuff and our lives and looking at the people in their disguises, when a group of teenagers wearing a white mask came to the glass behind us and stayed there observing. We glanced at them but tried to stay in our conversation. Another two people from their group stood beside them and took a picture with a camera. Moments later, they left.

Catherine arrived some time later.

We went to the Alitas and later Applebee's. The night end and everyone went home. I changed my profile picture.

Today I woke up and stayed awake. I fed Nymeria and then ate what my grandma made for me. She prepared three burritos but I left one that I would later eat on my way home from the session.

I met Paola in the University. I got there first and walked around the faculty. At first I felt exposed and nervous. There is almost nobody there that knows or could even recognize me. There were no stands in the building and I sat in the bench of the Language faculty. I felt this ache in my insides, a discomfort that crunched my guts. Paola called me and told me she was on her way. We saw Eddhy in the conference room and told us how there would be no stands but a conference at two in the afternoon.

We drank a cup of coffee and chatted in the Circle. Like yesterday I gave my name to be called when the order were ready. This time I was called. Time passed and I told her about my departure and plans. She talked about her classes.

I left and met with my patient. This was the last session of test applications. We didn't agree on a meeting for next week.

I got home and I've been talking with Melissa and Catherine. Melissa told me that she has said my name to the contact of the organization so I should be ready if somebody adds me or sends me a message.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene before the meeting.

There is the pain again. I'm tired.

### 2016-11-02

Day of the Dead. I met with Rene earlier than usual. He sent me a text yesterday afternoon telling me how they had just told him that the building would close at noon and ask me if he could set my appointment at 10 in the morning instead. I agreed. I would go out anyway, I had a meeting today in the office. "Office"... it's not an office, it's a clinic, a private clinic where I am a consultant, a freelancing evaluator.

Anyway, I could not think about something to talk about. I mumbled about my vulnerability and the changes that mark the difference between before or the barely beginning of hormone treatment and now, six months later. How being referred as him by a friend of my patient just moments before of being introduced as Sofia was a hit enough on my self-image, even though she corrected herself almost immediately after.

I mentioned the occurrence with the waiter and his question about if I was still a miss. "He noted and mentioned my voice", I told him. Do I have to hide it? Is it something that I should be ashamed of?

I woke up with Nymeria and fed her. This morning I went looking for breakfast and realized later that I was the only person awake. Neither my parents or brothers would go to work or school. My grandma had no reason to get up and prepare breakfast. They probably didn't even know that I would be leaving. I wanted to return to bed, hide under the warm blankets and rest my head on the pillow and my mind in my dreams.

Did I dream something? It's like I could feel the distant memories of a different reality. There was something about being naked and looking for a bathroom. I woke up before dawn and went to the restroom.

I showered just after getting completely awake and conscious. I left Nymeria in my room and could hear her hurting barks from the shower. Even after an absence of half an hour, my return to my room is celebrated by excited hops and energetic barks.

Just know I have her sitting on my lap with her head resting on the desk between my forearms. I see her round big black eyes hidden in her white thin fur and the warm of her body over mine begs me to embrace her and keep her close and smell her and kiss her. I don't think I've ever felt this kind of love and affection for another living being. It's different from all the kinds of love that I've experienced. Not greater or lesser, just different. I don't own her, I am not her mistress or her mother like Catherine and my mom says. She cares for me and I do for her. Even after just a couple of months living with her I don't want to think about my leaving the city, my leaving her behind.

Leaving Rene's office I drove straight to Liliana's. I got there a quarter of an hour late but the dr had not arrived. The dr never arrived.

In the Whatsapp groups there was a talk about a reunion to organize the exchange of gifts and the meeting before the holidays. In another conversation Paola told me how she posted on one of her groups and there was two or three people interested in the coursework that I've been planning.

I didn't want to let myself get excited. I had considered doing it and planning it. I wanted to and had the intentions. There is no place available, no option... I shared my worries and she resolved them in a matter of seconds. The hall where she did her son's party is available, she could reserve it. I would only need to bring the chairs and tables.

We kept talking about it and she showed me the post, she posted about different tests that they don't see in their syllabus and an excel program for the MMPI. I have all of the things she offered. The programs are ready, the tests I know and I've applied. Why do I feel reserved about it? Charging five hundred pesos would give me an approximate of four thousand in profits in a group of ten. Two thousand would be a modest expectation.

What am I waiting for? I told Rene I feel overwhelmed with the guide of the application exam and now the evaluation of my patient and now this course. I have lots of things to do. Gilda asked me if the girl contacted me, and that she would talk to her. Melissa told me yesterday how she recommended me to the Trans organization for the forum.

Isn't that what I wanted? Having things to do?

How is it that now I just want to lie down and rest. Even after I slept most of the afternoon?


### 2016-11-03

We were sitting in a stone bench outside the Burger King, in front of the Bol-Bol, the bowling place where we had planned about going but didn't. I had my phone in my hands and in its screen appeared a news article that I noticed from Facebook. 9 trans murders in Tijuana, was titled. In it, several sentences proclaimed the same idea: Men that transition from men to women. Trans women are men. They are seen by men by the police and the journalist keep referring to them, to us, as just that.

I have lost count of the times that I've thought how would it be being killed in a hate crime. Once by the pistol or knife of the killer, another by the article in the paper where they mentioned me as a cross-dressing male, a third one in the mass that I don't want where the priest mentions the name which I was born with and outgrown, and finally in the tombstone where eternally would be written a name that doesn't corresponds. How many times will I be assassinated?

Itayee, was she a friend of Telma's, sent me a message in the afternoon asking me to like a picture of her dog for a contest. Generally I ignored those kind of messages, but this time I looked at the picture and actually liked it. I did and complimented her on her dog. The conversation kept going asking how's everything been going and those kind of questions. Just moments ago, when she asked me about my job, she continued asking if it would be viable or possible for me to see her. I grabbed the agenda and remembered how I should be filling it. It's several months now that I am behind. The black one I bought with Catherine in the gift shop of the university was forgotten by its middle.

Anyway, the date is set. I'll see her in two weeks. Next one I'll finish with the current patient. In yesterday's meeting, Gilda mentioned me that she would communicate with her contact about her interest of Vocational Orientation.

I woke up and took Nymeria to her plate and outside. Everything went as normal. My grandma told me there was a burrito aside for me. It wasn't just one but two. My mother and brothers had already left. I thought it was just the two of us and the dog. I was mistaken.

Did I fell asleep before or after? No, I did and I was awake again when I left the room and heard steps on the stairs. It was my dad. What was he doing here? He opened the door and went outside. Would he leave? Did he went to work in the night? I heard the sound of a car accelerating and turning on and off. I looked outside and noticed it was my car. He was helping with it. I stepped outside and looked at him and what was he doing.

He asked me if I would go out today. I told him that in the afternoon. And so I did. I showered and changed. I wore the red blouse with strings on the neck. Catherine picked me up after finishing her session. We went to the bank first, I think. I waited in the car while she went to the ATM. It was in there that I answered Itayee's message. I got another notification, Medrano had commented on one of my pictures. I was scared, actually. I thought lots of possible things he could say that would make me really uncomfortable. But he didn't. He was nice. He just posted how he loves going to comic-con because of how you space out of reality for some days.

She paid her cable and we went to the Supermarket. I bought Nymeria's harness and leash. We went to the Giusseppi's in the Plaza of Fun World. For a while we considered leaving the restuarant. I thought they were ignoring us on purpose. Two girls sitting together, were we on a date? Or maybe it was the "guy in girl's clothes". The waiter came and everything went fine.

We played mini-golf and actually had lots of fun. We even bought some tokens and played some videogames. I had lots of fun playing Ms Pac-man and she did with skeeball.

Tomorrow she'll bring MuÃƒÂ±eca here and we'll take the dogs outside to meet each other. She'll take Nymeria home and care for her for the weekend. Will I miss her? How will I do? How will she?

### 2016-11-04

Catherine has Nymeria by now. I woke up half an hour before the time I feed her. I saw the watch but ignored Nymeria's cries. It was early. I turned off the lights and fell asleep for another 30 minutes. She stayed quiet as well, maybe she slept, too. I fed her and took her outside. There was a nice chilly wind. It's frustrating how the cold just last a couple of hours in the morning and then the Sun comes by noon and makes everything hot and uncomfortable. The switching temperatures give my allergies another opportunity to bother me.

I showered and put on male skinny jeans. I don't have hips yet, but my thighs are wider and there is a narrowing in my waist just below my breasts. It was hard pulling the pants up. I was going to start shaving when Nymeria's cries were louder and more frequent. I won't sleep with her for the first time since I took her home. I came down and let her accompany me to the bathroom upstairs. I shaved while she barked by my feet.

I saw Catherine's picture of her and MuÃƒÂ±eca. She was wearing a wonder woman t-shirt. The one of her costume. I thought we could match. The Superman t-shirt was in my closet. I could wear it. I would be wearing just male clothes.

I told Rene how they bother me less these last few days. Maybe it's because they don't make me look completely like a man. I outgrown them, they don't fit the same way, my changes are more obvious than them.

I put it on, but I see enough of the person that I was that I changed my mind and took it off. I'm wearing the green blouse that I had picked yesterday.

The luggage is ready. I put in there the pijama I wore this morning, the black jeggings that I plan to wear tomorrow and the black blouse with the white vest. Coming home I can either shower again and get ready or just change blouse to go and meet my friends in the evening. In the bag I put my sandals and the black flats as well. On top are the bags of cosmetics and make up. The only thing that's missing is a towel.

In the morning Ana Ascencio liked my Profile Picture. Does she recognize me as that student of hers? That one friends with Hilda, and the one that was walking once near Downtown with that friend. Does she know I am trans?

I thought about sending Medrano a message. A heads up. "So... what you think? Did you see this coming?"

No. I was nervous enough when I got his notification. I won't tease the bull if I know I won't handle its horns.

The red dress is hanging from the upper door of my closet. My face is already made up. I won't do anything to my hair. I am almost ready. There's like two hours left for my mom to arrive. Catherine is right, I got ready very early.

Am I nervous about the party? I've seen several of my uncles and aunts. Most of them added me on Facebook and are cool about me. They have seen pictures of me in dresses, there are the ones where I wore the black long dress and my face even fuller of make up than now.

Will there be some comments or questions? Is the dress appropriate? What about my cousins? Should I extend my cheek to the male ones or just wait for their initiative? What about the younger ones? Will they recognize me or ask about me? "Weren't you a boy?" "Why are you dressed like that? Are you gay?".

No, everything will be alright. My nose is running and every time that I touch it with my finger I think I take the make up off. Getting ready from now wasn't such a good idea. At least I know now how to put it on. This is the third time that I've put eyeshadow. The first one was barely noticeable. The second one was more obvious but still hidden behind either my glasses or a mask. This time is fuller and more colorful. I took a picture and sent it to Catherine.

Having this much make up makes me uncomfortable. I'm afraid about looking like a drag queen. I'm scared of seeing my male features through the colors and make up. I don't want to look like Ivan. I don't want people to think of him when they see me.

I don't want no one to remember that name.

### 2016-11-05

Since the last words, nothing has changed. Or, more correctly, everything is the same again. I'm sitting in the same chair and Nymeria is running in my room.

My profile picture is a new one different to the one of me wearing a bat-girl costume. That one has a little more than 50 likes. What are likes? I mean, I'm writing this to myself. I know what they are. Will I remember? Which me am I addressing this to?

It doesn't matter. Fifty people looked at my picture and spent a little more than a second making proof of their approval of my picture. It seems kind of, pathetic. Giving meaning to a single click. But even then, if it's nothing, what about the people who didn't?

I see pictures of Omar and Valeria. They are Monica's friends. She appears on the list of people who have given their respective click under their pictures almost every time. I thought about Monica when I saw the most recent picture I uploaded and the ones my mother did. The profile picture is public by definition. Everyone, absolutely anyone can see it. She is unblocked, so she can type my name in the search bar and that picture will appear. The rest won't. Just that one and the previous ones. But my mother uploaded more from yesterday. They are still friends. She doesn't have to even remember my name to see those. They will suddenly appear on her screen if she hasn't hidden my mom. And she will see me in the red dress and with red lips. Will she?

She won't. I think about her a thousand times more than she does about me.

We got to Mexicali by 8 in the afternoon. We arrived directly at the party. My aunt welcomed me with a hug and complimented me. Most of the women who know me did. Men were different. They seemed uncomfortable by my image. No, they didn't. It was just my aunt's husband. He extended his hand to me and I could sense repulse from his face. The kids were something else. Didn't they recognize me? My cousins said hi without mentioning my name or anything, it was as if nothing had changed at all. My nephews didn't acknowledge me. They said hi to my parents and my brothers, and the passed me. Maybe they didn't see me, maybe they did but didn't know me. Maybe they did but didn't know what to do. Or what to think. I noticed their eyes. I didn't know how to feel, so I felt nothing. I ordered sangria. Then later that night I ordered Kahlua. The dinner was chicken and pasta. Both of them had cheese.

I didn't dance. I missed Catherine. I could had brought her. I was exchanging messages with her and the thought came up. Would I introduce her as my girlfriend? I am not only transgender, I am homosexual as well.

To some theorists, me liking women doesn't make me homosexual and that, ironically, makes me less trans as well.

They might see it that way. That I have a girlfriend makes me "less abnormal".

I didn't noticed at first. I did hear her but, I don't know, the words didn't register or I paid no attention. It wasn't until my aunt Armida came that I heard her consciously: "And this here is Sofia" "I finally meet you", she answered with a chuckle.

She introduced me to her family. I could see it under a benevolent perspective and think how she's acknowledging me and showing her support, her standing behind me. Or I could see it as she thinking I am somebody different to the person who I was.

The party ended an hour and a half after midnight.

Today we had breakfast at the pancake house. In the morning they mentioned something about going to a buffet in a casino. They weren't kidding. On the way there I felt nervous about being asked my id and having to bear a fuss about the discrepancy of appearances. When I passed under the metal detector and the lady asked me for my credential my heart skipped a beat. I showed it to her without taking it out of my wallet. She looked at it and inspect her. Her eyes were different when they returned from the card to my face. She said nothing. There was 17 minutes left of the buffet, so we left.

The plan was that we would return by noon. There would be time, except there wasn't.

We waited for Edgar to congratulate him on his birthday. We visited my uncle and we arrived to Tijuana an hour after the time I was supposed to meet my friends. Irving said my name when he hugged me. His girlfriend greeted me, does she know? Everyone said my name and used feminine pronouns except my uncle when he said good bye. Did Ivan slipped him or was it intentional?

Should it matter?

I feel anxious and restless. I feel like screaming.

Just now I feel like crying.

### 2016-11-06

Last night in was the daytime change. Is that how it's written? We delayed the clocks an hour. It's not something new, it's done every year.

I felt, something, last night. I remember crying in my bed under the sheets. I hit Nymeria after she did something. She stayed quiet after that. I feel it's really late but it's barely 8 in the afternoon. The day started later than usual. Or is it earlier? I had one more hour of sleep and dreams. I dreamed a lot today. Nymeria woke me even later than usual as if she knew my mind was busy.

The first dream was a kind of a compilation. There were different sequences of stuff that I don't remember. One of them I ran from a chase of two identical people. Then I turned into two as well. One of me was killed, stabbed, by them, and the other grabbed their keys and took off with their car or bike or something. It wasn't me me. I was a guy and my appearance was different. Inside my dream I woke up in a theater sitting with known people, one of them was Chevo, to whom I asked about the themes of the movies. As I suspected it, the themes were related to my dreams.

We were walking in some kind of school, I recognized the terrain and buildings of my jr high. There were several people walking amongst us, like those times when I would start classes and walk through the front door towards my classroom. It was late at night as the skies were a dark gray. The people surrounding us suddenly were all wearing red robes with hoods that covered their faces. And then, an orange light flashed around me. Heated flames embraced my body and another flash blinded me. I woke up. It was 5 in the morning. Was it the new or the old time?

I slept again and entered to another different dream. It was more complex and real. I was in some kind of ship, was it underwater? There was some kind of sense of urgency. It was drowning. The danger was known, as of a sounding alarm blaring, or was it some kind of hidden threat? I looked out for an exit. Another theme in that dream was the idea of fake realities. The boat was real but, like matrix, reality was disguised in a simulation. In it I was playing some kind of videogame, like those arcade machines of an era before mine. The activities in the game played as another layer of the dream. Around me there were several other people, were they children? Was I a child? Was I a boy or a girl? I remember wearing something like a red dress.

I told Catherine how a girl of those came closer to me and almost brushed her body against mine. There was a thought or feeling that I've never experienced before. It was doubt, doubt of her intentions, was she trying to be affectionate? She rested her head on my shoulder and I wanted her there. Did she know I was a girl? Was it wrong? It felt, abnormal, weird. Not the sensation itself but what could be seen. I never really stopped ant thought about being gay.

Then, another dream was an old woman, a scientist with an investigator or journalist or something. She explained the simulation, the reality. She explained about me, the child. I was her creation. I was the core personality and root memories of her late partner. She was a biologist or computer scientist or something. She was the creator of a Neural net computing simulation. She was explaining it about her wife, she was a psychologist, her first work was titled the Genetic basis of memories, attitudes and behavior. Nobody took her serious, she was a woman, she was trans, and her discoveries contradicted everything known in the field. Until they met, and with the woman's work, they proved in the DNA and neural structure was embedded the core personality and memories of people. With that knowledge she was able to preserve the person whom she loved in this new child, their savior.

The journalist was something related to Monica. That part I skipped to Catherine. Was she her herself? Why was she still young? What importance would it have my person to a Monica's relative?

"So, your wife, she was Sofia" was the revelation that would culminate in the dream. Except it didn't got to that. I woke up. That reality, that story, that tale came to a finish and it extinguished leaving nothing but fractured and expiring memories that are cursed to fade away.

### 2016-11-08

It's been several days now that I waited for these elections today. It's not my country, I don't live there. Although I live in the border, in the near future I probably will be moving further away from this neighbor nation. Why am I this worried? Yeah, neither of both candidates were optimal. Both had their deficiencies. I'm glad I didn't have to cast a vote to either of them. Yet, everything on play is important to me, to people like me.

It's not that I fear Trump. He is a fear-mongering, mysoginist, homophobe and islamophobe. His vice-president, Pence, is a bigger and more concrete threat. He is a religious conservative who thinks homosexuality is a disease that can be cured. I don't even want to imagine or infer his thoughts on transgender people. There are two vacant places for justices on the Supreme Court. The republicans own the Senate and Congress. They'll appoint people who align with their beliefs. Their changes of policy on SRS surgeries, HRT and Informed Consent should not matter to me. I am on my treatment. Foreign policies on Trans treatment don't matter on here. Discrimination, on the other hand, do. North Caroline and several "red" states have these laws where they prohibit people of using a bathroom of the other gender of their birth certificates. What does that mean to me? What will happen when I cross the border to go shopping? What will happen to me when I'd need to use the restroom or a fitting room? Will they respect my papers?

I woke up in the early morning and fed Nymeria half an hour earlier. I forgot to fed her last night. She was asleep and I didn't want to wake her. When I realized it was two hours after her meal-time. I decided to let her sleep.

My father had told me to get up early and accompany him to take the car to the shop. He would take my brothers to school and return for me.

He did. I didn't change. I just put on a hoodie and went upstairs to shave the excessive facial hair. I drove the jetta following him. He took me through some strange paths. Worried that the car would stop, I tried not to desaccelerate suddenly. Various cars would get between us and slow down. I almost lost him three times. One, in the freeway, I missed the exit because of a van.

We got to the shop and I left the car. I felt the sights of the mechanics on me even though I was far away. I went to the pick up trying to hide myself but it was closed. My father returned and drove me home. He tried to make some chit chat just before arriving. He mentioned the elections. He asked me about my application. When I made a comment about staying in the capital for the times of the application, he didn't seem much convinced. I didn't want to continue talking. I feared we would make that comment about surviving by myself, maintaining me, being self-sufficient without his help.

I got here and slept. I've slept a grand fraction of the day, I graded just one of the four tests I was supposed to interpret today. I am so tired.

"Do I bother you?"
"Not that word"

"Why didn't you want to go out today?"

Was there ever plans for today? It was the weekend I think or was it yesterday? I asked her about going to the In n Out. She mentioned Friday, asking me if I had a patient for that day. No. She does. Her only off days are today and Friday until next week. She's busy. She has a job. She's successful in a way.

I am busy too, I have things to do. I have a post saved in my phone about a place where they rent offices for single therapy and courses. It's just 100 pesos for an hour. There are people interested in my offer.I have this evaluation I have to finish and another patient waiting for next week.

I feel like I reek. I don't remember the last time I showered. These last few days have been exhausting. Tomorrow I'll see Rene. The party was this friday, Catherine took care of my dog. She has only two days of rest and I, having a full list of things to do, am bed-ridden because of self-hate and depression and fear.

What is wrong with me? Why can't I bare to be happy?

### 2016-11-09

I did not notice the empty white square in the upper side of the blank page. I had finished already when I accessed to the statistics page that I finally see the lacking number of continuous days. A sudden explosion of panic made me move from my chair. Didn't I write the words the day before? I looked around in the archive that is my memory, as if I were looking for a misplaced file. "I know it's here, it has to be around here, somewhere". Something had to be wrong. There must had been a mistake. I replayed the day before on my mind, I graded the tests, I used excel, I was tired. Didn't I write them? I didn't, did I?

I felt resignation. Again, more than one hundred days thrown away. I failed. I forgot.

The three projective tests and I would redact the report today. Just four tests and I would had been done. It wasn't much to ask. It wasn't that tiring. I still failed. I interpreted one. I left the double of work for today. That was even before knowing that there would not be a meeting in the morning.

My car is still in the shop. I woke up but returned to bed. The morning was mine. I didn't even try to pretend that I would do some work in the morning. I slept and rested. By 10 in the morning I woke up again with the urge to postpone the alarm clock for more minutes. I showered without remembering the last time I did. I felt disgusting in the stench of my own body. I shaved my body and my face. There were crimson droplets of blood and the cuts of the sharp mis-strokes were well received. I embraced the pain and enjoyed it. When the alum stung as I passed it, I smiled a little.

Did I like the pain?

The uber was at the tire shop when I ordered it. He came 10 minutes later but still left me some minutes before the closing of the clock. I had things to talk about, I guess. Rene misgendered me again. Was it intentional? Was it because of the way I was dressed or my voice?

He asked me how I was dressed in the masculine way. The pain was different, it wasn't physical or enjoyable. Was it that I didn't think it was deserved? My face froze and de-inflated. Why did I try to hide my discomfort? Isn't the whole point of going to therapy the freedom of expression? Why wasn't I able to correct him? Was that his intention? Would I hate him if it were? Would I hate him less?

I asked for another uber home. Maybe tomorrow the car will be ready, probably it won't.

Catherine sent me some texts while she was at work. The last ones were where she said that we could invite Anahi somewhere tomorrow for breakfast if she had a late shift. Herself would not enter until noon. Maybe we could go to Denny's or IHOP, somewhere closer to the border.

I thought about yesterday's election. The dollar is more expensive, it has reached the 20 pesos. I don't have a car, I would need to return in the evening for my session.

She told me not to worry and continued. Anahi would prefer going out on the weekend because those are her free days, but she works those, that's why she wanted to do something in the inner week.

The only thing I kept reading was how both of them have a job where they are paid in dollars. Neither of them have to worry about the devaluation of the mexican peso, or being discriminated because of their identity. None of them have to worry about hiding themselves or live in fear because of whom they are.

And I resented them, and I hated them. And I hated the world. Most of all I hated myself. I asked her not to keep talking.

I saw the election yesterday. I watched the shows and looked for the polls. I saw the fear and anxiety in the hosts and guests. I felt it myself. I don't even live there. I can't live there. I won't be able to, anymore.

Most of the states were Red in that map. Most of the states hate me. The laws that passed to help people like me will be discarded. Today I read the news that my government didn't pass the initiative of the president asking for equal marriage. They don't support the gay community.

They kill the trans community.

I'll be alone, completely alone and vulnerable.

Maybe it's not sadness I feel, but fear.

### 2016-11-10

"I see you very cheery and joyful, how are you?"

I finished with the last evaluation. I finished the report today. I went to bed last night without finishing redacting the conclusion. I trusted my self-control, hoping that I would stay up in the morning and finish it instead of returning to bed and continue sleeping. And so I did. I fed the dog and ate my own burritos. I was irritated and kind of upset about something. My grandma called me "son". And then, correcting herself, repeated "son...daughter". I acted as if I didn't hear anything. I redacted the last paragraphs and printed the whole thing. I fixed a mistake when I mistyped the objective of the Person under the rain test, so I printed that page again. There was no way for me to realize I had written the patients last name wrong.

I stayed for a while in the living room. Did I think about something? Felt something? I just remember being extremely tired. I couldn't stand there for long and I hide in bed. I put the alarm to wake me up by noon and yet I postponed it for an hour more. I showered and got ready. By now I am wearing my pajamas and have cleaned my face.

I read a post in Valeria's profile. It appeared on my feed and it was long. Why did I stayed and read it? It wasn't the first post she had published about the Trump's winning. No, the one before that was about the election, and the mexican people who posted their pride about voting over there. Monica had liked it. I didn't really agree with it. What if some mexican celebrities published about voting over there and inciting the american population to do their civic duty? I guess if they're living there and have the chance of voting it's because it's their business. I hate that absurd nationalistic pride of putting your native country before all. "How do they dare to incite the american vote when they don't do it here?"

I saw Monica's face in the little boxes under the numbers and I wondered what did she think? What was or is her opinion about all of this?

Maybe I did think about all of that when I read the post and I made my comment. I was enraged and upset and posted a comment almost as large as the post itself explaining my worry about the outcome. Would anybody read it? Would Monica? How would she feel reading my words, recognizing my speech and thoughts? Would she care?

It stayed there, and the numbers under Valeria's post kept increasing. Maybe it's hope that they want? Feeling like they have a little bit of control. Convincing themselves they have the answer and are above the masses who follow the american way.

Yesterday I asked Catherine to stop talking and most of the evening went by in silence between us. I sent her a message apologizing about my weakness and fragility. She doesn't think I am weak. Almost at the same time I confessed I am afraid of breaking in any moment.

She thinks the opposite. I asked her about it but she felt asleep. The night came and went and I read her answer in the morning.

"I feel like you have a lot inside: anger, rage, fear. That instead of becoming weak or just about to break, that is what is making you stronger. Not strong as in a fighter sense, but like though, impregnable, isolated. Maybe you are feeling like shit, I don't know, I really don't know what you feel. Every time is harder for me to reach you."

My grandma tried to make me some meat, but it was overdone and it tasted like a tire. I couldn't eat it.

The uber was really close and yet it took like 5 minutes to arrive. It was a young man. They make me more uncomfortable. He welcomed me and made some small talk.

"Are you sick?"

I remembered the waiter and his suspicious face and his question. Was this going to be like that? Does he think I have a sore throat? Does he suspect anything? Why does my voice sound so manly? "No, why?" I answered.

"You're going to a medical center. People go to the doctor when they're sick."

I told him that I work there and that made us talk about psychology. His mom has Borderline pd and his father is bipolar. He has ADD. "Do you have something?"

"No" I lied.



### 2016-11-11

Nymeria bites me. She does it over and over, almost every time that I hold her in my arms. Is it intentional? Does she try to hurt me? I don't think so. Just now she is almost inside her food plate biting it. Her teeth hurt, they're growing. She's teething. That's how is called in children.

Yesterday Anahi, after I sent her a picture of Nymeria on my legs, told me her cat died. Telma was her name. I asked her if it was true. I could not believe it. I didn't want to. Today Catherine told me how it was this monday that she had a rest day. The cat was irritable, and later she was having difficulty breathing. When they got to the vet, they told her that it was poisoning. She died on the table.

Anahi had the cat for several years. I remember her mentioning, Telma and Yoko. Until now that I have Nymeria, I guess I would had never understood the lose of a pet. Nymeria is more than just a pet, more than a dog. I care for her way more than I ever did for Stitch, or even Max and Sparky. I read of Anahi's cat and I imagined Nymeria's death. I couldn't help to cry.

She's outside walking into the darkness of the empty rooms. Does she want to be alone? Does she want to rest on her flower bed?

I've returned from there. She went to poop on her mat. Catherine told oh how her mother was surprised when she saw Nymeria going and actually peeing on the mat. I took a piece of toilet paper and grabbed the warm shit and threw it on the toilet. Stepping out of the bathroom I stepped on her front leg. A sharp high cry deafened me. I see her limbing on one leg and I feel guilty of the harm I did to her.

She's under my chair right now nimbling on my sandal.

Catherine would pick me up by noon. I got up and fed the dog. Outside my grandma had prepared me three burritos. Did I do something in the morning or did I just return to bed to continue sleeping? I remember setting the alarm to 10 in the morning. Two hours was enough to showering and getting ready. I turned off the lights and close my eyes.

I was falling asleep when I felt something wet in my behind. It was a pressure and warmth. Was it Nymeria's tongue? Why would she lick my asshole? I should had taken her off. But it felt so good. But it was so wrong. I should not let her. She's my puppy. Maybe if I didn't know that I could just stay this way. I am so comfortable, so relaxed. Each breath is deeper than the last. I feel some hands over my body. The darkness is not the one I am accustomed to. There is something strange in it, something that doesn't fit. Nymeria is small, she can't really climb to the bed. How does she reach me? I felt it more and more, the pleasure was drowning me. I let myself go and climaxed. I was dreaming. I should had woken up, I could still avoid the mess. No, it feels good. It should not matter. I stayed in bed and continued sleeping. I could deal with it when I wake up.

And some time later I did. I slipped my hand into my pants and there was nothing wet. I guess the hormones do make something. It's been months since I started. How much since the last time I ejaculated? It was in Mexicali, when we went to the course of neuro. No, once Catherine came to my house and I invited her to my bed; Nymeria was already here.

That time I came but didn't have a condom. In the rush I couldn't stop it. Both of us were surprised when almost nothing came out.

I showered and got ready. I put on the red blouse not caring about the heat. It's the last month of the year and it was 32Ã‚Âº outside in the middle of the day.

We picked her mom from the border and left her home. Catherine drove us to the swap meet where we bought the sweaters for the gift exchange. It's done, it's over.

We went to the italian place near our high school, and from there we ate some ice cream.

Her session was at 6pm. We got there an hour before and stayed in the car for a while. Half an hour before we went into the office and her patient was leaving.

Liliana stepped outside after they entered. With her Karla stepped outside as well. Liliana kissed and hugged me. Karla looked at me and when I smiled, she recognized me.

I saw her as Ivan. I evaluated her as a boy. She was the last patient I saw in disguise. The only one who still doesn't know is Hiram.

I guess Liliana is right. It changes nothing. Everything is alright. I am a great person and that's the only thing that matters.

I hope.

### 2016-11-12

The evaluation is done. I won't see the next patient until next friday. I have this whole week to myself and time to study. Tomorrow I'll use to rest. I don't have no plans of going out or having any sort of meeting. It will be just me time.

Yesterday, when I accompanied Catherine to her session with her patient, before entering to the office I got a message of my Patient, Arantza. I saw the notification with her name and opened it. She has my number and contact information. The message said she just wanted to thank me for this month of evaluation. I said it was a pleasure working with her.

Today I woke up in the morning to feed the dog. I think I gave her the food a half an hour later than usual. Nobody was awake. Was today the day I had the dream or was it yesterday? I remember narrating it in english, to Catherine I have no reason to do that. Maybe I dreamed the night before. I have the urge to open my phone and look for the message. I guess I'll do that.

It was today, this morning when I woke up from the dream and this morning when I had the chat with Catherine. I read her dream of going into a narc's house and having Nymeria with her and seeing whole families inside. Small children.

I got out of bed with the mixed emotions of the dream, but when I read hers, mine looked tame in comparison.

In mine it was some sort of Christmas or New year's party. I remember being in Mexicali, not because of something particular of the place, but being surrounded by family and relatives. Catherine was there, and maybe some of my friends as well. Some things happen about them, about Edgar and some uncles, but I didn't remember them. In the middle of the event, I don't remember if it was a courier that brought the package himself or some relative acted as a middle man. I was given a box, was it a box or a tube? Whatever it was, inside had a big piece of paper with its corners burned. It was like those letters that girls used to do in elementary school, that with a lighter they'd burn the edges of the sheet to give it some kind of decoration. This was big and it wasn't just the edges. Pieces of the inside were gone, words and phrases missing from the text.

I read the first line and it's redaction and language made me feel ill. "Hey! Hello, it's been a long time, you might not want to know about me but I wanted to wish you happy holidays..."

Who would send me something written in english? Monica was the one who appeared on my mind. I stopped reading and focus on the whirlwind of emotions that made a chaos of my insides.

I was excited knowing about her, but at the same time I was mad at her, sad and upset, angry even... but I was happy that she reached out at the same time. But with what nerve does she contact me?

I didn't know wether I wanted to read it or threw it away.

I continued passing the words and I got into the signature. It wasn't hers. Ruben Sanchez. Is that his last name? I didn't get to it until later in the day. His is not Gonzalez. I don't think is Sanchez either. Who knows...

Without the missing phrases I could read how he was in middle school and even though Monica told him I was "an effeminate man" he didn't care because I was his friend and always nice to him.

Some people helped me to read it and I got lost into it leaving the party as something outside.

I woke up with a mixture of different complex emotions. I don't think he cares about me or is even interested in what has happened to me. Maybe he doesn't even remember my name. Does he like Monica's new boyfriend? Do I hope he does?

I slept most of the day. My mom and grandma left to the salon and my dad left to work. This evening was the night of drinks with the psychologists of the office. Catherine would not go and I didn't know if I wanted to.

In the end I showered and convinced her to go. It was nice, I liked it and felt comfortable.

I guess I am not as lonely as I think.

### 2016-11-13

Yesterday I read about an indie game which was having a discount. Its price was lowered to zero because of Trump's winning of the presidency in the United States. The theme of the game was about lesbians, I think. I downloaded, maybe today or later I could play it. Since yesterday I've had the plans of not doing nothing today. Leaving this Sunday as a last day of leisure. Not like the rest of days in which I do nothing ignoring the things I must do. This day was free of any things to be done.

The papers for the application are still non redacted and unscanned.

Yesterday I painted my nails before leaving to the Coffee. I painted with red over the already almost-covered nails. My left thumb is already losing its finish in less than 24 hours. I have to buy another batch of pills and hormones. I have until this Friday with a full dose. The week before that I'll turn seven months and start another four day rest of estrogen.

Why do I keep entering and reading the posts about trans people? What do I gain reading about the opinions of the people who dismiss my identity and state of mind? I am nothing but a mentally ill freak. I am less than a person. A potential mutilated man in dress. Do I look like that?

The first was yesterday, the video about the 14 year old girl who was just starting hormones and making a statement about bullying. Most of the comments were graceful and supportive. That was actually different now that I think about it. I've seen that video several times. Years before it was really small the number of positive comments, now they were the majority. This time it was several threads in reddit. I shouldn't even care about the opinion of heterosexual men about wether they would or not be attracted to me. I won't be attracted to them.

What reason do I have to dismiss the Trans exclusionary radical feminists then? The women who insist I am a fetishistic male intending to invade women spaces?

Which was the first women's bathroom that I entered? I wasn't alone, I entered it with Catherine. Was it in the US or was it here? I've entered several now, I don't think I could even estimate a number. And yet, I still get nervous. I am anxious about suspicious or judging stares, I am scared of comments or making a scene. I'd really prefer that the bathroom were empty. For me, for my own safety.

I don't even see myself entering the men bathroom anymore. I don't think I can remember the last time I used a male public one. Most, if not all, of the late times that I've gone out, I've done it presenting female. I'm comfortable, mostly, with the way I look, the way I'm seen.

People gender me correctly and I've stopped worrying about their reason behind their words. I don't mostly care anymore if they do it out of ignorance of my situation or politeness or knowing support.

I remember some of the first smiles that accompanied their addressing me. Were they because I looked female or because I actually didn't?

I could argue that the latter is more validating and supporting.

I've been having this new urge of looking at my recent pictures and the first ones of this year. I didn't look as passable as I thought. Will I feel the same way about these ones when I see the other changes in the future ones?

Catherine went to work. This Wednesday probably will be the meeting with the dr in the office. I'll see Rene and talk about something, I guess. These next few days of the week I should start doing the slides of the tests and fixing the last details of the MMPI spreadsheet.

I have the motive letter to redact and lots of papers to scan. I know where most of them are. I think.

Talking yesterday about the future made me more feel more uneasy about it. As with the semester abroad, the closer the date it gets, to more far away I see it. The more disbelieve I grow that I'll actually get there.

I have reasons not to get nervous about it. In the car I told Catherine about the way my dad reacted when I told him. She's right. He does not my reasons, not completely.

Procrastinating about my getting ready will just push me further away from there.

### 2016-11-14

Yesterday was a day of justified leisure. Today I did nothing without having permission to not do it. I slept, a lot. I woke up early in the morning, an hour before Nymeria's time. It was six o'clock. I went back to sleep and I opened my eyes again at 7:40. Nymeria had already shat in the mat so there was no point in taking her outside. My grandma called me son and he again but I ignored her. The pain was still there, though. I sat and ate the two tacos that were in the red towel over the kitchen counter. My mother came down from her room. There was another towel on the table so I assumed mine were the ones I took. My mother was fooled as well. There was nothing on the table and the tacos I was eating were hers. She left and I stayed in the living room for a little more than an hour. I saw the latest episode of Westworld. Last night, when my father was walking upstairs to his room, he asked both Miguel and me, although his eyes were locked with mine, if we had seen the last episode of it. Apparently it was a really good one.

There was a popular theory on the internet that Bernard was really a host without knowing. There was a death of a central character and other important revelations.

I returned to bed near nine in the morning and didn't get up until one in the afternoon. Catherine was going to enter at noon. I told her I would not sleep yet. Nymeria was calmly falling asleep on her flower and she said to go and try to rest. I did and lost most of my morning.

Tonight the moon is supposed to be the biggest in who-knows-how-many years. The biggest and brightest, a really spectacular show. I haven't gone outside and I don't really feel like it. Catherine is in her home already. When she got out she told me how the moon wasn't that spectacular. I believe her.

I used to relate the moon to my ex. Whenever one of us would go to Mexicali, we would use the moon as a point of reference. Both of us could see it and we'd be looking at the same place. It was some sort of connection to the us. Was I the one who introduced the moon to our lore or was it her?

It was me, I used to write about her as if she were my friend, as if I confided in her in my loneliness. When we were a couple, I guess I introduced my ex to her.

Is it then another thing that was ruined because of her?

I don't mention the moon with Catherine. Neither does she. We don't miss her. We don't need it.

I had to shower just now. I felt disgusted with my own presence. I can't honestly remember the last time that I did. Was it Saturday? I guess it was. It should be. Two days bathing in my own sweat. Lost of hygiene is another symptom of depression.

This Friday my pills will run out. This morning when I fed Nymeria I realized the bag of food would not last me more than tomorrow. The mats have ran out to one, too. I sent my dad a message asking him if he could buy them for the dog. He loves her, even if he tries to deny it.

Is he proud that I completely take care of her?

If I did I wouldn't had needed him to buy those things for us.

When he came I asked him about any news of my car. Saturday he told me that the shop had said that they finally got the piece and would try the car the whole day. Today, he told me they contradicted themselves telling him that they hadn't gotten the piece yet. Tomorrow he'll call again and ask if the car can move. If it does, we might go and pick it up to take it to another shop.

I don't have to go out until Wednesday. There will be a meeting with Lili and my session later that day. Thankfully Catherine rests both that day and Friday. We'll go out Wednesday in the afternoon. Both of us had said that we would go to a motel. She asked me to wear the red dress.

Friday I'll see Itaye. I have to send her the location. Am I more or less nervous about me knowing her?

### 2016-11-15

I put on Catherine's dress like when we were just going out. I turned immediately to the mirror to look at myself. I am no longer scared of my reflection.

I woke up in the morning and fed Nymeria like every day. Had she shat already? I fed her with almost everything that was left in the bag and put on my hoodie. I took her outside. No, she just peed leaving a spot almost as big as her on the mat. I let her inside and ate the burrito and tacos that my grandma had made for me. This time I heard how she clarified to my mom that hers were on the table and she had left mine where they usually are. It wasn't much after eating that I brought the dog again to the room and went back to bed. Catherine would be picking me up around noon so I should be getting ready in the morning. Last time that we went out, both of us agreed that we would be going to a motel. I'd be wearing a dress and the two of us, our black bras.

I fell asleep around nine. Maybe a little before that. I know I dreamed something. I remember wandering around a hotel and being inside some sort of bathroom, again. I messed with the water, uh, how are they called. Those metal levels that you move to make the water come out and adjust its temperature. Whatever.

Inside the bathroom there was somebody else with me. Were both of us naked? He was a man. What was I? Did I care about covering myself?

Maybe that was a dream from the night. In the morning I know I dreamed about Monica, again. Luis was chatting with her on his phone. Were they talking about a picture? She asked him if I was there with him. I looked at him and told him with my face to deny my presence. It turns out she was referring to the picture. Something like that, it was weird.

Why do I keep dreaming about having contact with her and the uncertainty of my feelings about it?

Even in those dreams I don't know how to feel or react. I don't know if I want to reply or hear or read what she has to say. And yet at the same time I am excited, but at the same time guilty. I am ashamed of my own joy. I want to let her go, I want to just leave her behind in my past and history where she belongs now. Why do I keep dreaming about her? Is it because somewhere in my unconscious I don't want to?

Even if that was, there is nothing I can do. There is nothing left to try or say. I said and did what was for me to do or say.

It's over.

The alarm was set for waking me up an hour and a half before noon but it was useless. I changed it and postponed it countless times. Even now I can't remember at what time I finally got out of bed.

Catherine had sent me a message telling me that her father had told her to leave the car at the shop. So, in her house, they would only be having one, which was going to be used by her mom. Catherine told her that she was going to be out today, but her mom was already in the shower when she told me that. At the time of all those messages I was still dreaming about something.

She did came around two in the afternoon. I put on the red dress and then changed it to the gray one with the black decor, the first dress that I bought almost a year ago. I put on the blue one and stayed in that. I tamed my hair and put on my face. I waited with the dog and my grandma until it was my time to leave.

The first place we went to was the restaurant that took over the Ricardo's that we and the gang went to years ago after a class in the Mental Hospital. Now it's a betuccini's (or something like that). We ordered two paninis and two glasses of Sangria. It was expensive but not by that much. The ambient was nice and romantic.

We went to the AT&T and Soriana. We ended up in the same first hotel that I went to. We hugged and kissed and slowly took our clothes off and recognized our bodies as if there were years since the last time that we shared a bed.

I love her, I really do.

With her and my future, why do I keep dreaming about a past that I don't want to revive?

### 2016-11-16

It's don. Months ago, or was it years?, I saw it. I sensed it and noticed it and feared it. It was just a worry that later became a real threat. I got into some messages that wasn't meant for my eyes. My fears were confirmed in a cryptic confession saying he was a trans girl. I haven't slept easily since then.

He talked to a counselor in his school and a meeting was appointed. Today it's not just a secret that nobody knows I know. I've been told as if I had no idea nor suspicion. Countless nights I spent worrying and afraid about the consequences of this news. How would people take it, how would everyone see me? Would they believe them? Maybe they were just confused or following my steps. What if he wants to do something to his body? They are still a kid, they have no choice or voice. Would I be betraying them if I didn't stood by their back?

It's nothing permanent. They are barely starting puberty. I see myself in them, in their worries and fears. Everybody called me brave but I waited years. I blinded myself and hid under a dead shell. They are saying it, barely in the puberty. I was their age when they were born.

I need friends. I need somebody to reach out and talk and cry. I miss her. It's times likes this when I remember how it wasn't just heartaches and pain with her. She was one of the first people I told and didn't take it well at all. Why would I wish to come to her again with these?

Catherine picked me up in the morning. Just yesterday that we went out to dinner and to a motel I told her how I'm happy now with the way I look. I like myself and my body and my face. And then this morning I changed coming out of the shower and put on a blouse and these leggings. Inversely as years ago that I wore all normal clothes but a female attire, today I stood in the mirror with a woman's outfit but the long flannel man shirt. And even then I confronted the person in the door and I didn't find myself in their face. It was a him with broad shoulders and his hair tied back. I moved slowly challenging him, hoping that he'd fail to copy my moves and I would realize something were wrong.

I took out the blue blouse and changed it for a black tank. Everything came back to normal, and yet, still in that state of doubt about myself I discarded the idea of not wearing make up.

Catherine picked me up and drove us to the office. The dr was already there and setting everything up when we entered the coffee shop outside. We passed in front of two religious women preaching. I held her hand and felt her stiffness. We avoided them and I think a little part of me died.

The dr had difficulty remembering my name. He could name everyone but me. He hesitated before calling me everytime. Did he notice about... me? Was it because he sensed it was not a "real name"? Maybe unconsciously he dismissed it and forgot it every time. Maybe I'm just thinking too much about it.

Rene cancelled the meeting of today and my patient the one of tomorrow. I had thought it was for Friday and when I sent her the location she told me how something came up and we would have to postpone.

Rene was sick and I could hear his illness in his voice. This week my mother gave me the thousand pesos for therapy. I had told her how she hadn't. She was convinced she did and I was convinced she didn't. I wore my gray pants and when I tried to put my phone in the back pocket I felt pieces of folded paper in the way. Maybe it was a bill, or two. I felt that rush of joy of finding unaccounted money. I reached them and pulled out four bills for the amount of a thousand.

Is it bad if I keep them?

I told Catherine and she told me to.

Luis told two of their friends first before anyone else. Then he went to the counselor and last to the principal. "You did it backwards", they told him, not being able to imagine the load of those words and every emotion and fear and weight that they carry.

I think about them and my heart fills with memories of pain and my chest clenches.

I don't want them to go through it.

I don't want to go through it again.

I can't.

### 2016-11-17

This Saturday will be Luis' school's festival. Is it winter already? School will be out in less than a month. I should be studying for the upcoming test and the procedure of admittance of the master. Will I be entering school, too, this next year?

In the morning I woke up and the house was empty. My grandma is no longer here in Tijuana. Yesterday evening, my uncle, the husband of Cande called to the house and asked my father if he could pick up my aunt from the airport. They went, that was when my parents talked about the conversation with Luis' principal. It was when my uncle came for my aunt that my mom and I went to say good bye to them and my grandma who used their ride. We stayed outside the house and my mother told me.

So this morning was empty. I took some pills yesterday and then other ones this afternoon. They've helped but not enough. After feeding and taking the dog outside I returned to bed and went back to sleep. There was a new notification from Facebook in my phone. Today's Medrano's birthday. Would I congratulate him? He added me and commented on my picture. He was my friend, kind of. After all he was nice and caring.

My dad came and woke me. I was up when he approached my room. I drove the car following him to the new shop. We left the jetta there and he brought me back home. Had I eaten breakfast already? I served myself a bowl of cereal. After answering I realized he was offering to buy me something. I got here and maybe I tried to sleep again. No, I sent Manuel a congratulations message. He answered it in a comment below.

"Thanks, Sofia"

Were he not supportive, he would had not added me in the first place. Moments later he sent a message asking how I've been. He apologized beforehand would he slip a Ivan somewhen.

We chatted for a while. Had I graduated already? Am I practicing? How was it, that I realized and came to know I was, well, me...

I answered him and read what he had to tell me. He had a kind of psychotic break watching hypnosis videos on youtube. It was once to experience being a woman that made him fall into a derealization episode. He went to a psychologist and realized several things.

The conversation stopped and neither of us followed it.

I feel sick, I have a runny nose and a sore throat. Just yesterday Rene cancelled our session because of how he was feeling and that same day I break ill as well. I made myself a can of soup in the afternoon and then a cup of hot cider in the evening and now I'm drinking a cup of tea as I'm writing these words.

This will be the tenth day after my mistake of omission.

Catherine will be off her ship in an hour, maybe. Yesterday I finished at last the grades of math. From first to eight grade they are all done. Now it's just following the basis of geometry and trigonometry, which is what I don't really know very well and then to start reviewing Statistics and Calculus.

I should be starting reviewing the rest of the material. Biology and Physics and Chemistry. When I was a child excited with the idea of being a scientist I'd be thrilled to be studying these classes and themes. Would I love knowing how my life would turn out?

I remember being infatuated with Xennia in elementary school. She was the first girl that I cared about and missed. I would relate and play with Jessica and talk to her about the future. I draw myself taller and with glasses. I didn't know what I'd be studying. In elementary school I imagined myself as a scientist and an engineer. I wanted to study abroad far away from home, being independent and exploring the world. I wanted to have a girlfriend and feeling grown and attractive. It was a mystery all of it. What would I do, how would I look?

And here I am, with those same doubts about the future. Would I love going and facing myself, seeing their reaction as I stand in front of them. Would I be recognized? Would I be excited or scared? I did had a girlfriend, I met Monica and loved her. I met friends and fell in love with another girl. I studied psychology and travelled the world as I wanted to. I lost myself and found the real me. I am finally happy.

I am happy.

I got to know what happiness really feels like.

Would I be able to convince myself?

Am I able to convince myself?

### 2016-11-18

Yesterday we took the car to the shop. I drove the jetta and my dad accompanied me in his job's pick up to bring me back home after. I wrote how he woke me and I waited him to enter the door. This morning he sent me a text message saying the car was done and he would pick me up around nine in the afternoon to pick it up. I woke up sickish with my head hurting and my nose running. I took Nym outside and return to sleep again. I know I dreamed several things. I remember nothing.

I put the alarm at 8 and half to get up and be ready for my dad. I didn't really have the intention of showering or even changing clothes. Today would be a day of sleeping and resting. I had no plans. My father had asked me if I was to going out and I answered him no. Plans changed, I guess...

He opened the door of my room and I barely woke up. Nymeria is lying beside me biting and clenching with her jaw the little walls on the inside of her plate. There is no food inside. Maybe it's just the anxiety of teething.

I grabbed my phone, my wallet and the house keys. He asked me if I was ready and if I were going to go like that. "Yeah"...

Was he saying it because I was not decent? Maybe he was just surprised of seeing me in male clothes and with my hair tied. I got into his pick up and he drove. We got to the shop and he stepped off and went inside. Someone gave him the keys and he walked out. I stayed in the cabin of his truck. I didn't want to get off. Maybe he would just drive the car towards the truck and just exchanges cars.

He signaled me something but got into the car anyway. He drove it inside into the shop. After a little conversation with some of the mechanics, he signaled me again to go to them. I walked inside and the mechanic said good-morning. People saw me. I was just someone in pajamas and recently out of bed. Maybe that was. Were my fingernails still painted? Did I uncolored them yesterday or this morning?

I drove back home and he went to his job. This time he didn't offer me to buy food. What did I ate for breakfast? Oh, right. I took the bread from the table and then in the afternoon, nothing.

Catherine sent me a message saying she was in her elementary school and just saw somebody she knew. She would not go with Vania and her patient had cancelled. "Do you want to do something?"

We agreed to going to the movies and maybe eat something. The car was ready so I picked her up. She offered to drive. No, I drove first. I remember her driving and turning around the hospital to avoid the traffic. Yeah, we got first into the Theaters in Paseo Chapultepec. We bought the tickets and decided to eat in the food trucks near Liliana's, no, our office.

It was there that she offered to drive. We went to the Foodies La Cacho. We were going to try the craft pizza but instead we bought burgers. She ordered and asked my burgers without cheese. I was there when she said it and saw how the cashier annotated it in the order. After some minutes the burgers came and both had it. I decided against saying something. I told her it was because of the time, but honestly, I fear confrontations when I feel vulnerable.

The dispatcher woman in the gas station welcomed me using female pronouns. I've changed, I put on the old make up I used to wear months ago. I saw my face weirdly in the mirror when I got out, but in the pictures I took in the food place I seemed alright. Even after the movies, I went into the women's bathroom and nothing happened, nobody saw me suspiciously or said anything. It's like if I were invisible... no, not really. It's as if I belonged.

We went to see the movie of Fantastic beasts. The continuation of the Harry Potter universe. In the previews they showed a film, a documentary about the beatles. I told Catherine we could go see that and she was a little surprised. She looked at me as if she were meaning to ask something and instead she said she saw the preview and remembered about her distance with her best friend Viridiana. Was it today when she showed me the post about their friendship?

We all have a past, I guess.

### 2016-11-19

I thought Catherine would not go to then think she would, again doubting she'd make it and finally receiving her, again, inside my old elementary school.

I woke up around six in the morning. The sun wasn't out yet. I barely opened my eyes consciously about my surroundings when I perceived the silhouette of Nymeria trying to climb my bed. In what seemed like a blink I saw her going to the mat with her tail high and her back legs arched. It was too early to feed her. I cleaned her evacuations and told her to go back to bed. We slept again for some time. I fed her later in the morning, around eight, closer to nine. I had to awaken her. My father came with breakfast. We all sat at the table to eat. It's been long since that happened.

I slept again. I've been feeling really tired. Maybe it's the flu or the allergies. I don't know. Luis' thing was in the afternoon. I returned to bed and put the alarm by eleven. It was time enough to get ready by noon. He had to be in his school by one. I could not get up from the bed. It was noon already and I just took my clothes to the bathroom. My mother was just finishing with her hair and everyone but Miguel were changed and ready. I asked her if they were all going to leave Luis. "Is Miguel ready?" I told her I didn't know. He was in the living room in his pajamas. He came upstairs and asked if he had to go. He didn't want to. I showered and said that I would caught up to them. Catherine told me how they would not let her leave early. Even the workers from the am shift were still there.

I painted my nails and my mom called. "I'll pass the phone to her", I heard him say and grabbed the phone. She told me that there were posts already set up so we should get going. She thought that Catherine would go still.

I left right then. Nymeria stayed with Miguel in the living room. I drove towards the school I went to, how many years ago? One since graduation, four of college, three of highschool and three of middle school. 11 years ago since I graduated from that school. 11 years ago when I was younger than Luis and he was still a baby. When I was a normal child and would never imagined myself as I look right now.

I sent some messages to Catherine. She took her rests and then told me how she had gotten off. The friends of her mother would take her to Cathy's job and from there she could come. She had missed Luis dance already, but maybe we could go somewhere to dinner. My phone was dying. It had less than three percent when we exchanged the last messages moments before I welcomed her outside the school.

I told her how I've dreamed a lot in that building. Countless dreams have happened in the second floor of there. Me in classes or coming out, climbing the stairs. Going still to school even in college as if something were still unfinished or undone.

I made the mistake of asking my mother if she talked to her psychologist friend about the reference. She told me how her friend told her that she didn't think it was a good idea sending him to anyone. He was in his teenage years, in the phase of puberty and the hormones and the physical changes and the chaotic emotions. It might just be a phase of a pattern as consequence of affiliation or something like that. I could feel and see my body as she was talking. I noticed my hands calming themselves and my feet not finding where to stay.

I feared that. I feared nobody would believe him that everyone would just assume that he'd be following my steps, that I was the first and real one and he was just confused or imitating. Am I making this, my hell, harder for him?

Selfishly I don't want to go through what I went through again. I don't want to re-experience, even vicariously, what I suffered. I don't even want to witness it. And yet, I am abandoning him. I am letting him go through everything alone and without support, without help, doubted and denied. All of it because of me.

How can it not be my fault?

### 2016-11-20

Days keep passing by like shooting cars on a highway or raindrops falling on the window in a rainy night. After not being able to sleep I took my phone and opened the photos app. I went back to the beginnings of the year and looked at the pictures of me. Month by month I reviewed my face and expressions. Seeing when and what clothes I bought. The first times I wore them and the smiles in the pictures I took. I could see the subtle changes on both my appearance and apparent mood. I see the most recent ones and compared to the first ones, I am different. I have changed.

Today it's been seven months since the first day I took my hormones. Seven months, more than half a year.

Tomorrow I'll see Itaye. I remember talking to her in high school. Once after a class or in a free hour we sat and chatted. She asked me what I was going to study or what my plans were for the future or something like that. She was Telma's friend. Telma was this soccer player, dark-skinned girl with black hair and playful toughness in her personality. I don't think she knows about me. I haven't heard from her in years. We were never close, really. With lots of people I wasn't.

I woke up early today but kept returning to bed. I am and was tired. When I took Nymeria outside I felt a roughness in my throat. Maybe rest and sleep would help. I ate both of my biscuits. Fuck it. We would do nothing today. I asked them and they answered. Maybe tomorrow we'll go to the United States. Tomorrow is a free day because of the revolution of Mexico. I did not know that. I'll see a patient in the evening. I should print the interview right now. I don't need to rehearse it. I could do it freehand now, I guess. It's comforting having a guide, though.

Catherine went to work and back. Now she's asleep, I guess. She's just answering. Moments ago I got into the pottermore page where I did the tests that supposedly tell you which Hogwarts house would you end up selected in. I did the other one as well that tells you what form your patronus would take. That being the spell of defense that is made from the happiest memory you have.

Would I even be able to cast it?

What would my happiest memory be? I don't think I have the energy or will to ponder about that right now.

Yesterday I went to dinner with my family and Catherine. We went to that restaurant in the neighborhood of my childhood. I lived far away from there, nonetheless I went to grade school and jr high there and my mom's school is there and the house of my childhood best friend. The first time we went to that place was with Norma and Jessica. In 2008 when the crime spree in Tijuana developed that place was the host of one of the firsts civilian shootings. Panic reined over the city for years. People narrate that period as when the narcos stopped just killing themselves and everyone were in danger.

Ever since I was a young child I feared criminals. I told Rene several times in session how to me, monsters were real, but there were no ghosts of beasts, they were killers and kidnappers. They would come to my home and take me from there or kill all of us to take our stuff. But even then, I never really considered myself in danger. I mean, yeah, nothing protected me, but I wasn't more vulnerable than anyone.

Now, I am. I live in the second most dangerous country for trans people. The north one have some draconian laws that try to control even where I can and can't go to the bathroom. I have to hide and protect the my identity and personhood for fear of being doubted, or harassed or even attacked.

People might come and flirt with me and then turn hostile when they realize why I am not interested. Even walking around holding the hand of the woman I know is something that infuriates lots of people. Our relationship is not natural in their eyes. We are a menace to their values and families. My own existence is a burden and disgrace to them. They don't know me, they haven't seen me nor heard my name. And yet, I am hated.

### 2016-11-21

I saw my patient, Itayee. She's the first patient that I get by myself. I charged her my fee and attended her by my own. I feel fine. I guess...

Catherine went to work today. She has the same schedule as last week. That means she'll rest tomorrow and Wednesday and Friday. She'll get off her shift later today in the night. She got in at 2 in the afternoon, so she'll get home probably an hour before midnight.

I didn't know until yesterday that today is a free day. I sent Lili a message asking her if the Center would be open and if she'd be there. Her answer was just a thumbs up and a kissing smiley. I got up thinking we would go to the United States. Luis and my grandma were already up and in the living room. I took Nymeria outside but let her back in after realizing the floor was all wet. I ate two tacos of the eggs my grandma made as breakfast. My father came down and when I asked him, he replied that my mother didn't want to go, if I had a reason to go to the Unite States. I told him no. I mean, I want to go, but I don't think I have a reason. I can wait another week, I guess.

I went back to bed around nine in the morning and stayed in bed for most of the day. I slept and slept and dreamed and dreamed. My mind rested and didn't. Nymeria stayed with me in the room lying on her flower. Someone woke me because of some reason but I can't remember.

I didn't get up until two when I fed Nymeria and started considering getting ready. My mom went somewhere, was it Rosarito? I don't know.

Catherine got off and just sent me a message she's waiting for the bus. We are talking about my patient and how my session went.

I got dressed with jeans and a grey hoodie and gave my face a pass with the double edged razor. There was no point in shaving my chest or my pits. My clothes were androgynous. Yeah, all of them were women's but still, there was something in my image that even made myself doubt.

Time passed and I didn't know if waiting or leaving. Catherine talked about a protests of the bus and taxi drivers. She left home early because of that. I returned for a 100 bill and my ring. I've been wearing the graduation ring almost daily. I didn't even want it when we were looking for grad packages. I like that it's feminine and its design that it's two rings interlaced, as the two people I were at the moment of graduation.

I'm seeing a video posted by Vinicio, well, more like shared, about the sex reassignment surgery of a MtF trans person. He had several likes on his post but I got into the original video to read the comments. Why would I enter into that? There are hateful comments and the defensive ones that question why the people are so hateful or judgmental about the actions and bodies of others. I remember years ago when I would read those same comments and variety, but the ratio was very different. Now it's more like half and half. And even then, I read most of the negative ones and they readily mention God.

Do I have a reason now to hate religion and distance myself from those places?

Catherine is home. I sent her a message telling, asking her if she wanted to do something tomorrow or the day after that she'll be free. She answered that she doesn't know. She wants to, but she doesn't feel like going out.

Why do I feel hurt by that?

I drove towards the Medical Centre and all the way there I realized how early is the sunset now. It wasn't even five thirty and it was already dark. I got and parked next to a car without wheels. We were the only two cars parked outside. The Food places across the street were almost all empty. Just a sushi place and the one on the corner were the only opened.

I had thought about going into the D'volada and buy a cup of chai tea. When I got to the door I realized it was closed and a pinprick of fear caught my attention. I sent a message both to Lili and my patient. In some moments Lili came down and then my patient arrived. Everything went well. I just, it's done, I guess. I'll have tomorrow free.

Maybe Wednesday I'll just see Rene. Maybe I will see Catherine. Who knows...

### 2016-11-22

"Has Luis eaten?" "No, he's upstairs. We talked on our way here, and when we arrived he got into bed" I sensed what that was about and stayed quiet while sitting in front of my computer at the same table. My dad went somewhere, maybe the kitchen, maybe upstairs. He left. My mother turned to me and felt the need to update me. "I asked him about his discomfort, since when it began. He said it's been around four months, since the changes started, the hair and... the puberty changes... What do you think? Should I take him to a sexologist?"

I was empty inside, both in my chest and my mind. There was no thought or emotion but the urge of getting away. I shook my head and told her I didn't know. "How don't you know?" I don't. I asked her if she won't go to therapy herself. She said she hasn't been able to contact the psychologist. And conversation died there.

I sent a message to Catherine but it stayed unseen and later unanswered. When she finally replied it was with a twist of the mouth and confessing she doesn't know what to tell me.

I don't want her to say anything. There is nothing to say. Then what do I want? What is the purpose of my sharing?

I feel this nervousness and uneasiness all over me. I'm exhausted and I don't know why. In the back of my mind lies this fear that I am sick. That there is some disease taking toll off my body, Maybe the illness is a series of irrational thoughts or heavy emotions. Maybe.

Tomorrow I'll see Rene. Last week he called me a couple hours before the session, when Catherine and I were on our way to the meeting in the office, to cancel it. I understood, even though I really needed it. I need it now, too. Maybe more, yeah, I think I need it more.

Why does every time that I consider of leaving therapy or prolonging my sessions something comes that makes everything so hard?

I've been remembering those times that I can't send away the idea of breaking up with Catherine.

It's not that I don't love her anymore or that I am sick or tired of her company. It's not that I don't want to see her again.

What is it? Why do I consider isolating myself when I am burdened by the fear of ending alone?

Yesterday a sentenced came when I was asleep. Maybe it was a dream or just a pre-oniric thought. "I think it's best to get used to not being around you while I have friends and family, that bear the loneliness of being completely alone"

Is that a reason or an excuse?

I won't break up with her. I don't want to. It's the opposite of what I desire.

I woke up in the morning just moments after my mother left the house. I ate and took my pills in the meantime of Nymeria's breakfast and going outside. I returned to bed as usual and slept through most of the morning. It happened some other days before. In the in-betweens of those moments of consciousness I am troubled by the realization that most of the day has passed, that I am wasting daylight to be hidden in slumber avoiding reality. I think about seeing the watch and noticing how is the late afternoon and feeling guilty about being so useless and weak. I end up seeing hte hour and noticing it's not as late as I feared. And even then, I am unable to get away, to get up and face the world. I cowardly return to dark avoidance of rest.

Nymeria climbed the bed and I let her lie by my side. She stayed there for an hour before wandering around and me putting her down.

Lili asked who evaluated Arantza so that person could get in contact with the psychiatrist to arrange the delivering of the report. I answered and she gave me the number. It was late already so I didn't decide to call his secretary right then. My father was by my side and my mother on the head of the table. Honestly I guess I was ashamed of calling and introducing myself as the psychologist Sofia. The act itself and being witnessed by my parents.

With what face can I confront my father anymore when he might think that he losing another child is my fault.

I don't know that. I am putting thoughts and emotions in him.

I am the thinks that. I am the one who blames myself.

I thought about going to the beach after session. Having some time to myself in some coffee place to think or not-feel.

### 2016-11-23

I agreed with Catherine to go out today. She had said that she didn't really feel like going somewhere. She did want to see me, but the idea of going out, I guess it was tiring to her. I told her my plans of visiting the beach, even if I had to go alone. I had to leave my home, I could not stay here. Before falling asleep she told me she could accompany me. Later we confirmed. Today we could set the plan.

I got up before my mother left. I went to the kitchen while Nymeria ate. There was a tortilla bag with two tacos inside. Or where there three? I don't remember. I ate half of the first one and Nymeria came to the second part of her morning routine. When we returned back inside I took my pill case and finished my meal.

I was tired, even though I had convinced myself that I would stay up all morning and won't sleep until the night, I couldn't resist getting into the sheets. I slept maybe two or three hours more. I know I dreamed with Monica again. I made a mention of it with Rene. Even later I would made a comment about that with Catherine. We have talked about what would happen were our relationship end. Could we stay friends or keep contact? The answer she had given me was a no. Even when I insisted and urged her to think or consider, she said it would depend on the circumstances. I remembered her. She changed her mind. I told her how, no matter what happens between us, I would never want to go through what I went with Monica again.

In my dream I was in my old house in Otay, specifically my parent's bedroom. I was alone, I think. And the phone, or was it my cellphone?, rang and I answered. Her voice came through the speaker. I did not see her face, I could not sense her intentions from her inflection nor words. Why would she talk to me? Why, after all this time, would we speak to each other?

I can't remember the beginnings of the conversation, but when she used a feminine word to describe me, I felt both excitement and disbelieve. Why would she say that? What happened?

I woke up and gave it no more thought than it deserved. I showered and changed. We agreed, Catherine and I, that she would meet me outside Rene's and from there we could go to the beach. I talked in the morning to the psychiatrist office and received the e-mail from his secretary. I forgot to send it before leaving to my session.

I walked to Rene's office and waited a couple of minutes outside. I bought a bottle of lemonade to break a 100 bill. The cashier asked me if I had the 10 pesos, but I didn't tell him that my whole intention of the transaction was that I didn't. He looked at me with a faint face of irritation.

In the session I spoke about my home. I thought about talking about Monica's dreams before Luis, to waste time, to avoid it just as I avoid it in real life. But I didn't. I talked about it since the very beginning. I cried an important fraction of the session. I spoke about how it happened, how it hurt, how my mother told me and my father and talked to him.

At the last 10 or 15 minutes I made a mention of my ex's dreams, their frequency and importance, my reaction and emotions related to them and my thoughts. Later, when I talked about the idea of breaking up with Catherine because of my fear of not being able to get over her alone, I related my wish to get away, to flee and leave Luis and my family to deal with this whole situation.

"So, just like Monica did".

It was such a great punch, than instead of being hurt I broke into laughter.

"I don't know how to feel about that. Should I came to understand more about how she felt and her motive, or do I have more reason now to resent myself just as I do her".

Catherine waited for me outside. We stopped at Soriana and bought a loaf of bread each. She bought a plate for her dog and a doughnut.

We went to Argana. The service is worse every time we go. And as such, every time that we are served by the waitress of the time before our leaving, I cringe before her speaking. She misgendered me again. This time, more than sadness, it was irritation.

We made a stop in the coffee near the beach and we talked and chatted as we did when we were in college. We saw the dark waves coming and whistling and shared stories and memories.

I agreed of having a drink with Paola tomorrow. A coffee, more than a drink. I'll explain and give her tutorship about the MMPI. I'm a little excited about it. Maybe we could talk and plan the course before my next departure.

### 2016-11-24

Even after the insight and both self and given interpretation I could not get out of bed. I woke up, again, before my mother had left. I ate while Nymeria did as well. I took her outside and return to my pills and the rest of my meal. I had agreed to meet Paola in the Starbucks of the Galerias plaza an hour after noon.

In the night I got woken up by the cold. Is it dusk or dawn? Which is the early morning. Opening a new tab to look up for a word makes me lose time and the flow of thought. I'll just look it up later. It's not like I don't have distractions anyway. Just now I'm returning from cleaning the piss on the outside of the mat.

I took the thick sheet? Covertor? Cobertor? I don't know, that thing I place over the sheets so I am more warmed. I dreamed about something. The second time I woke up I was wet from nightmarish sweat. I don't think my ex was in this batch of dreams.

She wasn't in the second either. Again I let Nymeria got on my bed and sleep with her. Almost all of morning passed. I started to get ready just minutes before noon. It was weird going to that plaza. It's been a lot since I stepped foot in there. I can't even estimate the months that have been since I went there. I went with my parents. One movie, I got into the movie theater and felt exposed.

This time I got just some minutes short of the accorded time. I waited resting on the fence of the central garden in front of the Starbucks. I thought about ordering something but I had in mind how Paola said it would be her treat. It would be awkward ordering after that, and I wasn't in the mood to let something free go away.

I knew, well, inferred, that Monica would be working. It's a week day and it was just noon. Even then I felt just as exposed as that other time I didn't even recalled. Every person going and turning could be noticing me or seeing me. My clothes were androgynous as if I were expecting that. I wore the same black leggings and one of the long-sleeved shirts from my male wardrobe. I didn't put on my flats but the red vans tennis shoes. I even considered going with my face without any make up. I put it on like the first times I used it. Something subtle. I took a picture and sent it to Catherine telling her how today I did went boyish. She said I looked even girlier than yesterday. Was that the answer I was waiting for?

Paola sent me a picture of the traffic she was in, I replied her saying not to worry and that I would wander around window-shopping. I entered the Walmart of the place and looked around. I carried the backpack with my laptop and stuff. It's the Comercial Mexicana where they ask or demand that you left any bags in some wardrobe to be kept while you shop. I forgot about that completely until I thought I heard the voice of a worker calling for me. I decided to leave and went outside again.

Paola didn't hesitate to arrive after that. We talked, at first I explained the test to her, how the simple statistics apply to psychometrics and what do they mean in the context of the MMPII and the T-scale.

After I finished she told me how she had actually understood it. She could do her homework without problem. We stayed there with our drinks just chatting about school and the future and everything. I think we left around four.

Catherine's shift is over. She should be on her way now.

With Paola, she told me about giving a course to her classmates, explaining the homework and the test. I agreed. I could do that and earn some extra money. I told her to post it. By the time we left, she had just one answer. I guess probably there won't be anything tomorrow.

She gave me a ride to my car. I paid the ticket in the last booth instead of the ones in the parking lot.

Nymeria is outside. I call out her name hoping for an answer or hearing her footsteps signaling her arrival but instead my mother tells me that she's there hoping for some food to fall out of the table.

When I went to the bathroom I think I heard her vomit. After coming downstairs she stepped on the doorframe of my room and told me how Nymeria had hopped and fallen on one of her legs. I looked at her expecting some follow-up with new information about Luis or her first session. But there was nothing. Even now, I think how I'll finish the words and she'll greet me with an uncomfortable conversation.

This is almost as hard as before that I had opened up about me.

### 2016-11-25

I remember as if it were yesterday how I missed a day and lost the hundreds streak. Now I've finished almost three weeks since then, almost a fifth of a hundred. Time's running, blindingly fast. It's nauseating. Yesterday I finished the words at an early hour and went to bed just entering the night. Even I was surprised that I could sleep that early. It wasn't even ten o'clock when I told Catherine I would try to sleep. I know I dreamed something but I can't remember its contents.

I sent a message to Paola asking her if there were any news about the potential course I could give in her university. She didn't answer until this morning. Her message says that only the one girl that had commented but even she said nothing afterwards. I thanked her and, a little relieved I continued with the new day.

Yesterday I agreed with Catherine to doing something in the afternoon. I proposed it and she said that she was thinking of going out with her parents. They could go somewhere for breakfast. Later today she explained that she misses those Sunday's family breakfasts. Now that she works, she doesn't eat with her family. The weekends that her father doesn't work, she does. So, she took the opportunity of her father's given day because of Thanksgiving and invited them to the restaurant we went with my family. If she went to breakfast with her family, she could pick me up and do something after her meeting with the patient.

By that time I would had already finished with the course on Paola's school or taking Nymeria to her last shot in the vet. I didn't do none of those things.

After breakfast, both Nymeria's and mine, I took us back to bed, literally. I invited her to climb up and we slept for the rest of the morning. Later that my mother and grandma came downstairs to breakfast she woke up and I opened the door to let her out and accompany them.

Even after sleeping early yesterday and resting most of the night, I was exhausted and unable to get up and out.

Catherine went and returned from her breakfast and then went on her way to the office. I showered and changed. I'm wearing the red pants and the squared blouse half buttoned. Every one of my clothes is feminine, I'm wearing make up.

I decided not to take Nymeria to the vet. I can take her in the weekend or next week. Later when I went to the bathroom and calmly checked the date I realized how today isn't even the day that she turns 4 months.

Catherine picked me up earlier, her patient was a no show.

I left just a little after my mom and grandma returned from picking Miguel from school. I got into her car and greeted her. We tried to decided where to go with no avail. She was hungry. I ate just one or two nuggets that my mother bought me. The rest with the fries are still in the kitchen. We stopped in the park and chatted for a while. I had a deja vu. I asked her about where to go and she told me she didn't want to talk about that right then. She continued talking about Liliana and the psychologists.

We ended up going to the Alitas. We had fun chatting and talking and laughing. We ordered each a drink with tequila and clamato. She ate a burger and I some wings. After finishing we went for a hot drink in Dinasty12. Everything turned upside down. We talked first about something... well, obviously. Before that, the waitress received us and put the menus on the table. She welcomed us with the neutral masculine. And then confirmed it again with a "listos". When I told Catherine she told me how she thought she had said "Bienvenidas", but later "listos". I'd lie if I say it wasn't upsetting. I even told Rene how I stopped caring that much, but it was disheartening.

We talked about DF. What could we take with us and all that. Somehow the question about she coming with me came up.

I remember. We talked about birthdays and I told her that by hers maybe I wouldn't be here anymore. That's when the question came up, maybe she could come with me?

"I don't want to..."

"I know you have to go and stay there earlier, but I don't want to. It's the opposite of the semester abroad. Then I could not wait to leave, but know I don't want to until I have to"

She noticed how my face changed. Later on our way home she asked me if she had made me upset. I lied to her.

I have to, but I don't want to, either. Even when I told Paola, I repeated how it everything fits. Even if I don't get in, doing it this way I can fix my papers and all of that. It's as if I want to convince everybody that it's the best way and most rational choice.

But I'm scared.

I am really scared. I want her to come with me, I don't want to do this alone. I don't know if I can.

But I can't ask her. Less now that I know she doesn't want to.

### 2016-11-26

Nymeria is lying on her new bed by my side. The little couch-like mattress is right besides the desk. I was thinking about putting it next to my bed, but hers is almost wider than half of the free space between the bookcase and the bed. She looks small lying on there. I like seeing her biting it and turning around and then resigning herself to lying and resting.

The images of the dream of last night are still lingering on the back of my mind. I sent Catherine a message in the morning. The text reads that I found it hard to fall asleep, I was scared about thinking of next year's moving and had the effects of the late tea. I had bad dreams.

I wasn't really expecting her to ask about more information of my dreams.

I went to bed earlier but could not rest. The thoughts of going to the capital and the conversation of earlier with Catherine bounced over and over in my conscience. What will my travel entail? I'll have to go to the airport and present both my boarding pass in the wrong name and a confirming id with a mismatch picture. I'd go through security and again present the boarding ticket at the gate.

I'll arrive to the new city and will have to find a way to move to the hotel or inn or hostel or whatever I'm going to check in. In there, somebody will ask me about a reservation that I'll have to make in the wrong name as well, because I have no way of confirming my identity.

Then I'll look for a new apartment in which I'll have to call and set up meetings with landlords or roommates that will be potentially discriminating and hateful. How many offerings will I have to ignore because they ask for a man which I am not, or a woman, which they won't believe I am?

Getting an apartment will be a struggle all on its own. Even after outing myself and still being accepted and having it and setting the papers and formalities, I'll still need to look for a way to verify my address. I need an address verifier to start the process of changing it, so all of this will still be presenting me as Ivan to strangers and explaining my situation. After having this way of confirm that I live there, I can finally start the process of getting a local id, which, again I'll have to get with the forgotten name, and registering to the free sex clinic. In the latter, I'll present tons of different documents with the wrong name and gender so I'll can be interviewed by a psychologist or even a social worker that will assess me if I can be a candidate of their services.

 A month later I'll have enough to finally start the process of changing of name. With a new id with a match picture but wrong information I'll be able to ask for a new birth certificate. 10 days after, I'll get the paper which will let me process, again, the local id with my new name and info. And a month after that, I'll finally have something that ensures my identity.

Until then, I'll be battling the world trying to defend who I am. I'll be vulnerable and exposed in a large and dangerous new city. A tiny animal in a jungle filled with wild predators.

I woke up some minutes before seven. At the night I invited Nymeria to climb the bed. We ate some food and while she pooped I took my pills. I was thinking about the dream in which I was with Monica in a room somewhere. We talked and, were we laughing? Why the happier I am in those dreams, the more upset I wake up?

I waited an hour in the living room to anyone to came down and confirm we would be going to the United States. Both of us slept for an hour or two.

We did go. We ate brunch at Denny's where I asked for the burger with egg inside. I was wearing lady jeans and the purple sweater. My father called me Ivan twice and I think I heard my mother say it once along the day.

In the Denny's my mother said how she skipped her course yesterday because she wasn't feeling alright, emotionally. She called in, the session had moved things too much. Later, she threw at the table how she was recommended by her therapist that we should all attend family therapy. My father looked at her, no, he stayed facing ahead, but his face changed confirming he heard her. He said nothing, though.

I don't want to. I don't want to explain myself again, or defend who I am, or hear what emotions I am causing them, their pain and grief because of something I did not ask nor choose. Catherine said maybe I wouldn't be the protagonist, but Luis. Still I am scared.

I don't want to stay and I don't want to go.

I want people to see me. I don't want to defend who I am, just be. Why can't I just be? Why does it have to be so hard and laborious and difficult for me to prove who I am, to live my life?



### 2016-11-27

I moved the bed back next to mine. Every time I turned off the lights, Nymeria would get off hers and calmly waltz over mine and climb to my side. After the third time I moved the bed to just push her out. She spent the night in there. It passed silently.

The morning was usual. I didn't took her out because of the rain. I let her do her stuff inside. It was a quicker routine. The breakfast came as usual. The dog looks cuter in her red holiday t-shirt. In the morning when we slept again I let her climb to the bed and even hold her between my arms. I felt the beating of her heart on my chest.

The nights feel a little less lonely.

I've been studying the math subjects in the page. Yesterday that... no, it wasn't yesterday. I returned with Catherine. Yesterday I went out with my parents to the United States. It was Friday that I and Catherine went to eat. On our way home we talked about French and how every time I would say some word in that language she would think of my ex.

I remembered Liliana's recommendation of the Duolingo site. I've been thinking today about returning to it. I might sign in with the different e-mail, a new profile. Start over again.

The subjects in the test guide are still unreviewed. The dates of the timeline are closer than I imagined. The first deadline is this Friday. I have done that thing, I guess. I am registered on their database. My legal info is. I have an extra month to upload the papers. The period of time where I was supposed to send the e-mail asking for a bank reference started already. I sent it today.

I should have uploaded the papers I have and written the letters needed to be redacted.

For a while I forgot or ignored the possibility of going to the family therapy that my mother mentioned.

Somehow we talked about the past and everyone from my mother and grandma mentioned the memories they have of Ivan and everything. My father called me with that same name to hand me the week money. Maybe a session would be the perfect setting to mention my discomfort and my pain. Because I understand, it doesn't mean I don't suffer.

In the show I watch, Shameless, Trevor, the trans guy has an argument with Ian when the bar where they were supposed to go is closed of an event. Ian mentions another cowboy bar nearby, but Trevor shoots down the idea saying they card on the front door. "You are over 21", he says not understanding. I did understand him. I understood him too well.

Catherine is upset because Anahi proposed her to go to Universal Studios the same day we set the Christmas party with our friends. She tells me how when she told his dad about going, he reply to her how they can go to somewhere where they don't have to ride anything.

She is upset. She could not go to the premieres, and when the park opened, she was not able to attend with us as we had planned. I see her frustration.

I feel like an asshole thinking how I'd give anything so that my issues were just those, not being able to go soon to a theme park I've been meaning to go.

I resent her for her answer about not wanting to go with me. I ask her if she has told Anahi how she felts, and yet I lied to her when she asked me if she had saddened me.

Earlier, months ago, when we talked about marriage and why she wasn't comfortable with the idea of doing it, she mentioned we were not ready. She didn't feel ready, and she didn't think I was either.

"You're too self-absorbed in your own issues to care about mine". Moments like these make me think she's right.

I'll see my patient tomorrow, tomorrow evening, thirty minutes after last week. Earlier that same day I plan to take Nymeria to the vet. I was just thinking about something else I could or wanted to do. Was it going to Dax and buying another nail polish? Was it looking for tights? Why would I need any of those things?

This Wednesday I'll see Catherine when we'll go to Lili's meeting. It's next week that we'll go to Bettuccinni's for Gilda's birthday and two days later the Christmas party. I was thinking of wearing the dress this Wednesday, maybe I could wear it at the party, or maybe I could wear the other gray one, Catherine used to say how it looks very holiday-ish.



### 2016-11-28

I woke up half an hour before it was time to get up. I can't remember if I tried covering myself again with the green blanket. If I did, I should had woken up in the middle of the night drowning in sweat and took it off. I slept the time until 7. In my dreams I was in some kind of school, was it the same building that I told Catherine I keep visiting in the nights when I sleep? I looked for a place to sit and realized I was wearing a school skirt. It was weird and unfamiliar having to worry about keeping my legs closed in a class setting. Something happened in it, maybe the classmates, maybe the teacher, I just remember the dread of worrying if they could notice I was different.

Was I a child? Was I older?

I fed the dog and let her shit outside in the wet floor. We came back and I filled my pill box and made two tacos with the eggs that were in the pan over the stove. I was in my bed again, under my sheets when I was talking with Catherine and seeing Facebook. I scrolled down and stopped at the window of the "people you might know". The first one caught my attention, none of them had any friends in common with me. Raul, he was from COLEF, another intern of our time there. I looked to the other one. The picture was darkened, Leslie Fernandez.

Leslie Fernandez. And I saw the face, even in the dark I could trace the silhouette of the nose and the eyes and the hair. It was the name that shocked me. I no longer have two brothers, I guess.

I got into the profile and saw what was posted. There was just that darkened profile picture and a cover one of two shadows. It was like my cover picture, maybe. My sibling made the profile just 10 hours before. Just before they fell asleep. Last night.

I took a screencap and sent it to Catherine. "What are you thinking? What do you feel?" "I just wish I hadn't seen it".

She wished that, too.

I let Nymeria come to the bed and we both fell asleep. We stayed there all morning. I didn't get up until after noon. Catherine sent me another message sending me a picture of the back of Anahi's ticket to Universal and asking me what mine said. I got mad. I had told her several times mine expires in December. I would have to explain it again, her issue, her problem agains mine which had gotten worse.

I told her and she apologized. I got out of the bed and took the picture to send her, that would put an end to that topic. Maybe she made me doubt myself. I got out. Did I shower then or did I wait something more?

I was out of the shower when Miguel sent me a text asking if I had taken Nymeria to the vet and would I be able to pick him up. I answered back saying I was just out of the shower and thought maybe I could pick him up and take him with us to the vet. We agreed. I finished and went. I realized that I had just fed her and remember how she pukes. Maybe it would be best to come back for her later.

I picked him up and drove us back home. I put the harness to the dog and the leash. I grabbed the box from the laundry room and got her in the car. We got to the vet without any issue. She was crying the first fraction of the trip. I let her come to my lap while I drove. Something in my gut was telling me it was a bad idea, but she was calm and relaxed. We got there and she didn't throw up. I was called miss and lady in there. They put her last shots and I filled the little certificate.

Before being called, as we entered, there was a kid with his family in there. Did they have a dog or where they just waiting for someone else? He mentioned something about Nyme. And then he told himself how she was a girl. Do people say that of me, too?

I made a stop in the gas station, just minutes before arriving home she threw up on my leg and the car. It was the consequence of not using the box I took.

I went to see my patient. I told Liliana how today got out the application of the master. There is the first date of the test in the capital. 4th of february. Two days before Cathy's birthday. Just as she said, I would not be here to celebrate it with her.

"Maybe I won't be here for my birthday" she commented.

She said she looked at the info and was a little excited at first before she saw the date.

I never stopped feeling nervous and anxious.

### 2016-11-29

I waited before returning to bed and sleeping again.

In my dream I was in school again, I was no longer a child nor was I wearing any kind of uniform. Vinicio was the professor, I can't remember what was the class about. Some of the classmates weren't the ones I frequented on the university. Something happened that the professor started mocking them. Several took it, not too well. They reciprocated physically and violently. I was caught in it, someone stood beside my and let fall unto me the contents of a bag filled with jalapeÃƒÂ±os. In rage I got up and ran following him. Somebody in the door said something or tried to stop me and I hit him.

The professor apologized. And then people were called. I woke up.

Again I got up before time. This time I waited in bed. I fed the dog and let her outside. Was my mother gone? No, I saw the two packages of burritos and asked which was mine. I took my pills losing the count of the weeks that have been since the beginning. My mother left and my grandma sat in the couch with me.

"Has Laura talked to you?" "Kinda..." I said ambiguously enough to be able to lose the subject were it to come. "...about Luis", she continued and there was no longer any way out.

She talked. She knows. Edgar knows too. They all think it's about his changes of puberty and all of that. It's confusion or a phase. They are no experts. Even the experts seem to be lost.

"Her friend, the teacher of the school" she is actually a psychologist, one of the experts, "told her, to research if someone in the family practiced black magic"

I was enraged. How the fuck would any professional psychologist dare to enunciate such bullshit to someone who was in crisis?

My grandma continued telling me, asking me if I had seen my mother cry. She was really moved by her session with the psychologist. "She told her that she has to deal with the grief, to 'focus on burying Ivan'". There is something in that sentence that annoys me.

I dealt for months, years maybe, the fight with the urges to really kill myself. I didn't choose to die, I chose to live. I decided to fight to live, to face the world and myself and embrace life with its pains and horrors. And yet everyone's suffering the lose of "Ivan", as if I killed him.

"You took my best friend mercilessly from me" said M. She hates me. Worse, she has just forgotten me.

"I don't agree, 'No, Laura' it's still the same person, we should be thankful that there is no sickness. She is still here, she's the same one, the same personality and everything'" "Edgar says the same, she hasn't changed, everything's the same, he is just she now".

She continued and mention my dad, but that was wrong. "Jose Luis, says the same 'He will always be my son'". Are they saying the same thing? Is he still in denial? Will he ever come out of it?

Would I be able to cut him off were he incapable of seeing me for who I am?

My grandma mentioned how yesterday, before I returned home, she said about my dad how "he just doesn't give a shit". She repeated it again. My father, according to grandma, stayed silent.

I returned to bed around 10 in the morning and slept. I let Nymeria climbed to my side and we both rested and hide from the day. I didn't get up until the afternoon, two hours in the afternoon. Catherine had sent me a message asking me if I was asleep and I answered it. She wanted to invite me to her home to eat. I declined.

She even accepted to bathe Nymeria if I would just take her to her home. I had no energy nor will to do that. I didn't want to shower or get ready. I didn't want to do nothing. I was well-rested and still exhausted.

Later I would ask her if she thinks I've been dealing with all of this in the wrong way.

She told me how she doesn't want to judge, she doesn't know what she would do were she in my shoes. Before this, she could imagine or compare her situation to mine, but now she's blank. She thinks, though, that she'd deal differently with Luis. Were she able to be with them and help or support, she'd do it.

That's the thing, though, I would reply later with tears in my eyes.

I want to, but feel sick and guilty, because I can't.

### 2016-11-30

I'm almost finished with Trigonometry. Two more themes and I'm done. I could continue with Statistics and actually review something that will be in the test. 4th of February. As I told Catherine over tea, I ought to talk with my parents as soon as possible about what am I , are we, going to do next year.

I feel like its another burden with the load they're bearing with right now. Another weight on top of the deal that I brought them at the beginnings of this year. 2016 was a hard year. How will 2017 be?

I woke up and stayed up in the morning. There were no burritos in the kitchen, just the towel-wrapped ones of the table destined to my mom. I checked the pan and noticed how in there was a scrambled egg and some fried beans. I heated one old tortilla and took Nymeria outside. My mom came downstairs and asked if Grandma had made burritos. "To you she did", I answered. She checked inside with the intention of offering me one, but they had cheese. She left, I told it was alright, I had already eaten. I didn't want to eat much, anyway. The dress I wore today was slim fitting. My mom doesn't like wearing dresses. I am not really affectionate of them, but I don't mind them. Catherine loves how I look in them. I like seeing her face when I walked towards there with a really feminine attire.

I showered and changed. I shaved as close as I can. I even shaved my legs and body although I would be wearing long sleeves and hosiery. I painted my nails before stepping into the shower. I had them with a light cream color. They are now a dark red, a crimson wine-like hue. They matched the tights on my legs.

Catherine picked me up half an hour before the meeting with Liliana. Yesterday I made the appointment to this Friday with the new patient. We got there in time, early even. We entered to Lili's office and sat on her waiting office. In the years we've been going there I've sat in different places. When we took Anahi to her first session with her, I waited with Eusebio and Jessica outside on the first floor. Her office was there, on the entrance to the left. Then, when Catherine went, she attended on the second floor on her current office, except the waiting room was now the Family setting where I've actually attended patients myself.

Minutes later she came out from her personal office and not much after, the new recruit entered the door. I told Catherine before arriving how I felt kind of nervous or anxious about something. She asked me if it was because of my session with Rene, but I told her no. "Maybe it's about that a new person will meet you, and is a man?" I remembered her question as he came in and I saw a familiar face. Liliana introduced us, first to Catherine and he said how he knew us already. We were in a rehab class in seventh semester. He extended his hand but put his cheek anyway to greet me.

Did he really recognize me? It was uncomfortable leaving and seeing him talking with Iris. It's probable that he recognized me and knew. Most people would realize there is something with me just with a short exchange of words.

Catherine drove me near Rene and after some minutes of talking, she left me around the corner of the building. I got in and started the session with a yawn. "Are you tired?", he asked me. I talked about my fatigue and lose of energy. I talked about my mother and her session and the stupid comment of her psych friend. I talked about Leslie's new profile and picture. Even the name is something new and weird to type.

Today I saw it again, as her nickname it was written "Les". The similarity of it threw me off guard. That's something I would never had done.

We ate in Hornero, a kind of fancy pizza place next to El Cafe del Mundo. From there we drove to Galerias where I bought Nym's food. I bought two teas with Catherine's money. I gave my name to the cashier and they wrote it on the cups. We talked about everything, even Monica. Maybe I could ask Chevo if he gave Omar the box. I could even ask him if he took a peek, I would not judge him. I might had done the same in his place.

Maybe later.

## December, 2016

### 2016-12-01

I am in front of the computer, just after returning from talking with both my grandma and my mother. I was in the couch watching the new episode of The Big Bang Theory when I eavesdropped on their conversation. My mom has now the number of the sexologist. She is not the one her therapist had mentioned. The first mentioned one was a male, a homosexual man who knew since he was a child. Karla Minguela. I've heard that name before. She teaches Sexuality in the Faculty. People love her and recommend her. I guess I am fine with that decision. She mentioned another name, another recommendation, this was for a family constellation. As I heard that I told her not to go to those kind of things.

Without realizing I changed seats from the couch to the table and talked with them. First I mentioned the move to the Capital and then about Luis and therapy. My mom explained about her first session. As I had suspected it, her therapist is a Gestaltist. She made her make contact with the buried emotions that she repressed during my coming out. She told Les while we were all at the table that she had the number already, and asked them when could they go. She mentioned something about calling the next day. Now I can't remember if it was about the sexologist or her therapist.

In the morning I woke up, again, as usual. I fed and took outside the dog. The food left for me in the kitchen were three burritos of flour tortillas. Two of them were folded in half instead of rolled. I opened then and notice how the filling was scarce and barely noticeable. At first I even thought it was just beans and chorizo. I ate two of them and swallowed my pills.

I considered mentioning at the table how Rene had the idea of starting to lower the dosage of the antidepressants so I could leave without any medication. Now he upped it instead. "Why?" would they ask, I anticipated. What has happened? Have I been feeling worse? And then I could mention how everything has been for me. The news about Les and the reaction of everybody and the feeling of having to deal with everything again. And on top of that there's the pressure of dealing with a move and all sort of issues of being alone in a different city.

Did I return to bed? I did. Nymeria spends her nights on her bed and the mornings she sleeps with me. This day it wasn't different. Miguel had told me yesterday if I could drive him to school, he'd be entering later in the morning. At a quarter before eight I put an alarm to nine. If Miguel would need me to take him before that he would wake me, if not, it was a good time. I was the one who woke him up. I drove him there and then return home. Did I sleep again? I think I did. Yeah. I told Catherine how the thought had came tome that the upped dosage had not worked. And then I myself realized the absurdity of the idea after just a couple of hours.

In my dream there was something about that. I took my pills in certain day and realized there were lots in the days before and I wondered if I should take them or not. I knew it would not do any good to take the missed doses, and yet again I swallowed the ones from a day before. Just to notice later that even more days were left.

Talking with Catherine I mentioned, just like yesterday the similarity of the nickname L picked for themselves. Les. Luis. I used it in the conversation and Catherine asked me if it was alright to call them that if we haven't been told to use it. Supposedly we don't even know it.

It's weird using Luis. I feel guilty every time I gendered them in any way. It feels wrong using female ones, and I feel guilty to use male nouns. With the name it's the same. Every time I type it or say it, I feel like somebody else calling me Ivan.

My mom mentioned her friend of the salon as somebody who could help me in my move to the DF. She lives there and I might be use their help staying with them for a while. I don't know how I would feel in that situation. And yet again I cannot imagine what I would do arriving to someone else's asking about rent and presenting in any way.

Just two months.

Less than ten weeks before I am there, before I leave.

### 2016-12-02

I'm home. This morning I didn't have the opportunity to return to bed and sleep some more. I'm exhausted and so tired I could just forget about the words and rest about reality, about everything. I showered as soon as I finished the two tacos my grandma made me and swallowed my pills. For a minute I doubted that my mom would shower as well and someone of us would be late. When I climbed the stairs I saw her in her room already changed. I got in and got ready. When I got out she had already left and I had time left.

I did my hair and put on my face. I picked the clothes and waited until it was just the time. When I was outside waving Nymeria good-bye the phone rang and I read Lili's name on its screen. It was a call to tell me she had left the office open just waiting for me. I got in and sat in the couch. I brought my book. I've been reading it for so long, I have entirely lost to ability to even estimate how much time I've been reading it. I am on the lasts parts of it. I read it sitting in the waiting room until the time of the appointment.

The patient arrived. I see several of Lili's patients the same. She made me think of that other patient I saw.

The interview passed smoothly. Everything went fine. We set up another meeting for next Friday at 10 in the morning. Today my mom was supposed to call the sexologist. Did she? Will she? I told Catherine in the car how I thought that I might be the one who brings L to the sessions. Would I have to enter as well? Will the sexologist be interested in me, knowing about me, knowing me?

The first session my mother will probably be the one in charge of taking them. She'll want to step in and answer the questions of the first interview and clinical history. Will she give the motive or will the sexologist ask L herself.

I don't know. There is no point in wondering about that.

I gave farewell to the patient and read Catherine's messages asking if I had entered already and later if I was out. Had I left?

Back home I sat and watched some television. We agreed that I could pick her up and go somewhere to eat after her session. There was a problem, I misunderstood her when she answered between two and two twenty. I planned to ask her at what time would I leave, but she answered at what time to pick her up.

I left home in a hurry and got four minutes before two twenty. She sent me a message asking to wait for her. I drove to Lili's office and in there she introduced us to a young woman and her granddaughter. The little girl kept looking at me. Did she notice something weird or different? When Catherine entered with her patient, Lili invited me in to chat until her patient arrived. She asked me how I've been doing but I didn't dare to answer truthfully. I talked a little about the pressure of time but that was it.

We went to the Tea house I've always been wanting to go. We asked for an infusion, it was red and we accompanied it with a slice of apple pie. We sat there taking pictures and talking. It was nice.

We left and had the plan of going to eat teriyaki. When we were on our way I confessed how I was not hungry anymore. I don't really remember how the conversation turned towards the DF. She asked in the gas station if we settled about what would we do for our presents for the holidays. My birthday is just two weeks after Christmas and hers is two weeks before Valentine's.

"We won't be together by Valentine's" It was just the reminder that I would be alone by then.

"It's absurd to worry about looking for a place where I can take Nymeria if I will already have to look for a place where they can take me... I have to be realistic and know there's a possibility that I'll be homeless."

Those words kept resounding in my head and I had a stomachache that later turned into nausea. We stopped in a place of Chinese food and I stayed in the car. I told her that it would be better if I came back home.

I didn't know if I would finish the words. I guess I just did.

It's not even time for Nymeria's dinner and I want to lie on the bed.

### 2016-12-03

I have the Khan page of Stattistics in another window just playing the video in the background. At least I can hear the things and concepts that I supposedly already know. For instance, the first video about what questions are statistical and which aren't.

"What do you want for Christmas?..." "For everyone to stop calling me Ivan"

Some months ago I thought about that exchange and what I could answer. It was a little passive aggressive and yet I considered it feasible. Today Luis asked me that question in the car. I stayed silent. I didn't dare to say that. Sometimes words hurt more than we think.

It wasn't the right way. If they ask me again, I'll just say to keep the money of the gifts they would give me and save it for when I pass hunger.

The ideas they gave me, even though they weren't serious, were useless having in mind that I'll leave in some months. They talked about giving me a control to the console of L, and then my mother said about giving me tape to put posters in my room. The room where I'll no longer sleep.

I've change the speed of the videos. I remember reading somewhere about someone talking about Sal's speed of talking and how he watched them at twice its speed. Even at 1.5, I think it's rushed and kind of cheating. 1.25 it's a sweet middle where he talks faster but it's almost unnoticeable.

Yesterday after returning from my date, or day with Catherine, I had a sort of stomachache and nausea. I went to sleep fairly early. I slept around nine or ten in the evening. A couple of hours later my grandma knocked on my door and asked me if I was in bed. I answered affirmative and told them to come in anyway. She said the robe for Nymeria was ready, she would put it on my night table.

I went back to sleep. I dreamed about a school, some sort of boarding school or college town. I lived with Catherine in a kind of room. We slept in two beds, how are they called, that beds that are on top of each other. She slept on the upper one. I was mad at her, or was I upset? Every time that I asked her to do something or being together, she was busy either studying or buying clothes. There were other things. In one I tried to cheat in a text and in other I was looking for some sort of book.

In the middle of the night I heard something outside my room. It wasn't the car getting in the driveway but the rattle of the keys in the door and the screeching of its opening. I was disoriented about time. Was it the next day already? Did I fell asleep? I looked at my phone and saw how it was two hours after midnight. Was my mom just arriving? I fell asleep again.

I woke up around seven in the morning again well-rested. I fed the dog and took her outside. The wind was sharp and chilling. I joyfully felt its grasp on my skin with a smile on my face. I didn't take the pills yet. Maybe my father would bring food, maybe we'd go to the United States. I returned to bed and put the red robe on Nymeria. She looks really cute and formal. I let her climb the bed and sleep with me.

My mom woke me up and asked me if I was going to shower. My brothers were already dressed. My mom and my grandma were sitting on the stairs chatting. I got showered and dressed. I put on the blouse I took off yesterday when Catherine said I looked monochromatic and the crimson jeans.

We crossed the border and went to eat to In n out. I asked for extra spread and enjoyed the cold that bothered both L and my mom. We went to Walmart. I bought a cushion shaped as a hot-dog and a hamburger planing it to give it to Catherine. Before that we stopped at Best Buy. They bought an Xbox for L to open up at Christmas. The seller asked them if they wanted anything else. And looked at me and then said about another controller so I could play with him. Did he see me as a girl? People in the burger place opened the door for me.

In Target I bought a blouse and a dark red hoodie. Luis bought a Pokemon X game, later they said I could have it for Christmas and exchange the pokemon.

That was really nice.

### 2016-12-04

It's been more than a week, has it reached the month?, since I met with Paola for coffee. We talked then about the shop, the course I could offer. The one she proposed on the spot for the next day did not materialize into nothing. She told me to make the poster and start offering on the social pages. Today it's done. She has it now and will upload it in any moment. I feel like when I was in high school and had just finished a flyer or some project, drunk with pride and creativity.

In another tab I finished the process of application for a debit card. I uploaded a picture of my passport and filled their blank spaces with my correct but outdated information. I signed with the mouse and then, in less than 10 minutes, I received two emails with instructions to setting up the page and making the first deposit to receive my plastic.

I told Catherine how the only limit was that I couldn't get deposited more than 15,000 thousand pesos a month. I can surpass that limitation by just uploading a proof of residence or even just my id. I told her as well how I thought the card would have the legal name typed in it. Maybe it won't, I hope it doesn't. It doesn't matter.

When I mentioned the limit she told me that the scholarship would probably not exceed the limit. I answered back saying how by the time that the scholarship would be set I hope to already have made another count with my name. "Why do you want it, then?". I told her it was so people would have a way to make a deposit to my card. "That's a good idea"

I will need a way so my parents can send me money for the first months of being there. Now that I remember the exchange she said it in a jokingly manner. "How much will the scholarship be, like a thousand?". She earns a lot more than me, she earns her salary in dollars. She knows I am sensitive about the frustration of not being able to look comfortably for a job, the fear of being discriminated for who I am. Just now I started to get upset. Should I let my emotions flow or should I try to shut them down? They serve no use to me.

In the morning when I took Nymeria outside I received a message from Lili asking me how I was. She asked me how went the session with Lorena and I answered. She continued if Lucy had contacted me and I told her the truth. I tried to deflect the topic of the conversation giving her the time and dates of my next appointments and mentioning the night of drinks next tuesday.

I went back to sleep after breakfast and let Nymeria climb the bed and rest besides me.

Last night I finished the book I've been reading. American Gods. I had been reading it for months. When I signed into the application where I track the progress of my reading, I came upon a picture of me with short hair and Monica behind my back. That picture is from more than 4 years ago, years before we stopped talking, years before she went to France, years before I went to Spain, years before I transitioned and started living. Years before lots and lots of things. Monica is infamous for the fakeness of her smile, but was mine any more sincere?

I tried changing the name, the picture, anything, but the app didn't let me. I tried logging outside of it, on the browser, but the e-mail or the password was incorrect. I tried several combinations but none was the right one. I let it be and went to sleep. L knocked on my door and gave me the DS with the pokemon card. I formatted the portable console and made my own profile. It was weird trying to represent me with Mii. When I played the game, I put my name in it and the group of fictional friends asked me for a nickname. I gave it to them.

My father gave me the money for the week and my mom the one for the month's therapy and 500 extra. I should go tomorrow to River plaza to make a deposit in the bank and buy the pill cutter. My pill organizer is empty. I should fill it.

### 2016-12-05

I found it extremely difficult to get out of bed in the afternoon. I've been taking the upped dosage of antidepressants and yet I don't think I've noticed a significant difference. I did get up in the morning to take my pills and eat breakfast and feed Nymi and take her outside. I, eagerly, returned to bed and let her climb to my side. Maybe an hour or an hour and a half passed before I actually fell asleep. I know I dreamed something. I dreamed lots of things. Lots of vivid and complicated narratives of a fictional reality.

Yesterday I applied for the debit card. I have the money to pay for the initial deposit. I can do it directly in the bank. It would be really nice not to involve the help of my father or mother. Just tell them I have it and they can deposit to it or use it for my course.

I changed and showered and did my hair. Several times I've wondered if IU'd be able to go out without wearing make up. Today I tried it. I didn't wear any. Not even base or mascara, not a thing. As natural as when I presented as a boy.

I had the information, the bank reference to pay for the master in neurobiology. I had the information to make the first deposit of the card. I needed to buy the pill cutter to stop separating them with my knife. And so, when I was ready, I left the house early to go to the bank and buy the pill cutter. I went to the plaza in front of the hospital where I had surgery more than ten years ago. I parked infront of the bank and got into the ATM. I try to input the information that I had in my phone but it kept asking me the number of the place. Was it some sort of code? I got out of line and tried to do some research in my phone. It was for naught. I tried it again but I couldn't go past it. I left and realized that the bank would close in less than five minutes. I had considered getting in line inside, going for the help of a teller. I went to the pharmacy instead.

I could had bought the Diane pills. They are like 300 pesos. I could ask for them later. I have until next week to buy them. I grabbed the only think in there and went to the pharmacists. There was no other costumer around. I was greeted by the one closest to the cashier and she gendered me correctly. I paid and got out. I returned home.

Paola published the flyer of my workshop. She got the first likes, of one stranger and Catherine. For a moment I was worried that the same outcome of the improvised one would happen. Nobody would be interested, not a single person would attend. Today, after leaving the plaza, I got a message of Paola telling me there were 5 people interested in the workshop, but formally eight.

I think it was yesterday when Catherine asked me if I had stopped looking for a different venue where to give do it. She wasn't all that convinced that Paola's was such a good idea. I looked for the saved link of the offices for rent. They had a room specialized for workshops. I found it. They charge 100 pesos for the hour and need copies of my id, a proof of residence and one of studies.

I doubted it myself. I didn't want to go through the hassle of giving mismatched documents and having to explain myself. In the morning she told me that she was thinking about a group of 20 or 30 people, like the groups of the university, but it was going to be more like 10 or 15. I told her I would love for the group to be as big, but I didn't expected it to be. At first I was actually a little disappointed. "Just 15 people, that's what Catherine expects of me". But then I started making the calculations. 10 people of students would be 8 thousand pesos. That's more than enough of a gain. Even if just five people went I would get around four thousand.

I started to get excited again.

I saw I* for the last session of applications. She spent most of the hour answering the MMPI. Tomorrow will be the party of the office. I won't see Catherine until then. I can still go early to the bank and do the things I have to. I don't know what I'm going to wear. This Friday is the Christmas party of the gang. I have to buy the ingredients and make the potato salad I promised. Wednesday I'll make the list.


### 2016-12-06

I don't know if I'll be here before midnight. If I have to cheat, tomorrow I'll write double.

Party.

### 2016-12-07

So I cheated. I don't really remember the last time I didn't truthfully wrote the seven hundred words. Yesterday I didn't get up until later in the afternoon. I went to shower and to the bank. I did not wear make up the first trip out like on Monday. The trip to the bank was infuriating and annoying. Since realizing the day before that I had gone to the wrong bank I looked for the location of the right one. I noticed how there weren't any in the plaza where I had gone Monday nor in the Galerias one. There was one, however, on the neighborhood two streets to the right.

With time to spare I went yesterday with the three references for the deposits. I got there without a hassle but noticed the parking spaces were full. There wasn't a single one vacant and in front of me was another car waiting for a spot. We were stopped in a red light which not much later turned green. There were cars behind us that took a turn and continued on their way. Three changes of the lights I turned as well and looked for another bank. There was another one near Monica's home. Going to the November 20th I would have to make a left turn before going over the bridge that crosses the freeway. The traffic from the bank to the Nov20 less than a km away took me almost 20 minutes. I missed the turn and had to make a u one passing the bridge. There was traffic on the way back, and, to make everything perfect, there was no fucking bank. In the supposed place where it should had been was instead a car shop. I didn't bother to look around for it, and instead return to the first one I had gone to. I parked the car a couple blocks north and went there on foot.

I got into the bank and saw several atms and two special ones which let me do deposits. I made the first deposit, the 200 pesos to my personal account. There was no problem of unknown information for a unexpected request or anything like that. I filled their boxes with ease. And when it asked me to review all the data, I tried to changed the box of "concept" where lies the description of the transaction. It wasn't needed for that specific deposit, but I did need it for the two of the masters. I decided to wait in line to a teller and ask him to do the deposit. I waited in line. When it was finally my turn, the teller saw me and after hearing my motive, he disregarded me saying "you can do that in the atm". I explained that I needed some info to be on the receipt. "You can do that as well". I told him a little frustrated that I had tried it.

It was uncomfortable, I was annoyed. He gave me my change and the receipts and told me "Have a good day, young man". I left the place, wondering if it was because of the name in the notes or my voice or that I wasn't wearing any make up. I drove back home, and on the way here, a person selling gum approached my window and addressed me as young lady.

I scanned the receipts and already have them on my laptop. I should had uploaded them to the system, but didn't. Just now I'm wondering how many days I have left until the deadline. How much can I pretend that there is no application and no days of waiting and hoping and dreading, no difficulties. Nothing.

I returned home and took Nymeria out for a walk. We walked to the other side. Instead of going right to the park where I once went with my friends of elementary school more than 10 years ago, we went to the left and climbed the hill that I walked every morning for a semester before I learned to drive. We came back exhausted and she lied down half-ly on her bed. Hours passed and I put on make up and got ready for going out with the other psychologists of the office. Catherine told me she could come pick me up. She would drive me back. I took her offer.

She came and I went outside. We drove to the italian restaurant we once went not long ago, and where another time years before we had gone with the gang one thursday after the hospital to eat breakfast when it was another different restaurant.

We got there and the valet parking received us with a "ladies" and took the car keys from Catherine. We walked in just after getting the text message saying they were already inside. Iris and Lili were at the table. Not much later Gilda caught up with us. We ate pizza and pasta. We talked as if we were friends from a long time ago. About the future and our past. Our trips and our memories. Our experience outside the country, Catherine's witness of a catastrophe and Iris hope of meeting a loved one.

Iris said that she had recognized us from sight in our time in college. I had dismissed it, thinking that maybe it was just Catherine. That maybe I look different enough to be separated from him. Yesterday, after the mention of our trip to the National Park of San Pedro Martir, she said that she had gone there with us. Catherine exclaimed with surprise remembering her and agreeing. I stayed unaware. I trust her, but I don't really remember. Later did I feel the awkwardness of being recognized and known. I had met her, I guess. She does know about me.

Hours passed and we drank and talked. We were the last people to leave the restaurant. It was a couple of minutes passed eleven. Catherine drove me home and I got in the house. Nymeria welcomed me with hops of excitement and I carried her in my arms upstairs. I opened the door to my parents bedroom to tell them I was home, but they were asleep. I came back to my room and got ready to bed. I took the make up out of my face and the cloths off. I got into bed and turned the lights off and the night lamp on. Nymeria walked towards her bed in her cute outfit and lied down without even trying to climb to mine.

I looked at her and caressed her. "You are so beautiful and pretty, yes you are, I love you so much", I told her in a sweet voice how I never had imagined I would ever talk. I kept caressing her and my words of love turned to worried laments: "I don't want to leave you behind" My eyes started watering. "I don't want to leave you". I was crying. "Please don't die"...

Where did that come from? What happened?

Not much later I fell asleep.

In the morning, as usual, I got up and fed the dog and took her outside. I fed myself and took my pills. I returned to bed and put the alarm to 10 and a half. Today I would meet with Rene. I tried to sleep and Nymeria climbed the bed. She got really playful the first couple of minutes and then just lied down by my feet. I dreamed some things that I don't remember. The warmth of her body on my legs was really comforting. I had to postpone the alarm several times and didn't got out of the bed until eleven.

I showered but not shaved, not my legs nor chest. I didn't even shaved my face more than a pass with the machine. I barely put something on my hair and let it wild. On my face there was nothing more than moisturizer. I wore a pair of pants that look like jeans and a long sleeved t-shirt that has a hoodie from the time I wore man's clothes.

I looked at myself in the mirror and wondered how manly or feminine I looked. The bra was thin and my breasts were almost not noticeable. My pants were very fitting and the curves of my legs, on the other hand, were fairly obvious. My face looked natural but smooth. It has changed. Nobody gendered me in any way and yet I felt comfortable. I walked to Rene's office and waited for him outside.

In the morning I made public the flyer of the course. More than twenty people have liked it, and several even shared it with their contacts. I put it in the group of the graduates of my class and even there got some views. I gave out some information to several interested people.

Maybe it will be a success. Maybe I will get some money. Maybe I am not really that useless. Maybe I can survive.

### 2016-12-08

After the missing day, I am again at one month. 30 days. My parents are not home. They left maybe an hour ago. My dad came before my mother and he entered with a roses in his hands. When my mom arrived, they agreed to going to the movies. They will probably are going to have sex. If I were in their place I would not really go to the movies, I would go to a nice motel and enjoy the company of my wife.

Yesterday, was it?, Catherine sent me the link of several hotels which charged around three thousand pesos for 5 nights in Mexico city. Double bedrooms. Between each other, that was achievable. A heavy weight was lift from my shoulders. I can now think about and imagine and enjoy the nights with her. The walking around the city. She says she can help me look around for apartments.

Even now that I am writing that, I even forget that I will be doing a test for a future master with a name that doesn't match anymore with my appearance. Lately I've been going outside without any make-up and not really feminine clothes. Yesterday I wore a red hoodie from when I dressed as Ivan. Even today that I went to Wal-mart to buy the beers and the ingredients for the potato salad I went without anything but moisturizer on my face and with a man's t-shirt. I wasn't gendered in any way, but I felt comfortable, I didn't feel no weird looks or comments.

I finally uploaded the scanned bank receipts. I uploaded the ID, too, to the bank site. It appeared a pop up message telling me to remember that a representative of the bank will contact me soon about the request of upgrading my account. I don't even have the card yet. Maybe I should had waited.

I woke up early before my mother left the house. I took Nymeria outside and ate the burritos my grandma made me. There were two packages on the table. Miguel had said yesterday that he wouldn't be going to school today. I returned to bed and let Nymeria climbed to my bed. The first moments when she's up with me, she's all agitated and energetic, moving around and searching my pillows or wandering around my body and scratching herself or digging my sheets. This time was no different.

We stayed in bed until the afternoon. I could had stayed there. I didn't want to get up. I was tired. I wanted to keep resting. I am so comfortable in my bed with Nymeria and nothing to worry or think about.

I read the recipes I found on the internet to the potato salads and looked at the ingredients. Miguel and my grandma eat at the same time, both of them were sleep, too. They ate and offered me something. I showered instead. I thought about wearing this shirt. When I went to give some tutoring to Paola I wore one of the male shirts, as well. Why do I want to tread into the androgynous? Why do I want to test myself? I went to Wal-mart and do some shopping. I bought fruit and onions, I bought eggs. I bought the ingredients for the salad and some even for Luis and my mom to do Tostitos with fruit and Clamato.

I went into the liquor part of the store and grab a 12 of beers. I am drinking on of them right now.

I went into the kitchen and prepared the stuff. I chopped and sliced the celery and green onions. I put the eggs and the potatoes to boil. I peeled the eggs and the potatoes. I cut them and mixed them with the green stuff. I battered the mix of mayo and mustard and stuff. I taste it and was a little disappointed. I let it chill in the fridge while I made myself the beverage that I am almost done with. I ate the two burritos that Miguel left in that second package on the table. I watched some tv, until my father and later my mother arrived.

I've tasted the salad again. The color and look in general changed from that first taste. I grabbed a mouthful with the spoon and tried it. It was better. I could taste the pickles in it. Would the eggs be a problem? Or the onion? What if nobody likes it?

Why did Paola not invite her boyfriend? A thought cross my mind. How would it feel if it was because of me, because we wasn't comfortable around me.

Is that really that possible? Enough to even think about it?

### 2016-12-09

Today is the day of the party, the Christmas party. I woke up un the early morning as usual. I had put an alarm to wake me up by 7, but I think I did not need it. I feed the dog and took her outside. My grandma told me there was a plate of eggs for me in the kitchen. I ate and took my pills. I was awake before my mother left. She told me to put the camera to charge. I did and the tiny yellow light next to the battery started flashing as I plugged the cable in. I let it there and went to get ready. I shaved part of my legs and body without shaving cream. I shaved my face but now I have some black spots around my mouth.

I drove to Lili's office 40 minutes before the appointment. I was by the oxxo when I noticed I had forgotten the tupper with the potato salad for Catherine's house. I came back to pick it up. I stopped by the gas station and put some liters in. The dispatcher didn't gender me in any way. Not that I heard. I got at Liliana's ten, fifteen at most, minutes before the meeting.

Nobody was in, the office was closed. Five minutes passed and I saw the patient getting in the center and walking upstairs with a man by her side. She waved me and I waved back. When she got to where I was standing I told her that we would just wait for Lily to open the office. I extended my hand to her accompanying person and introduced myself. He mumbled something and I thought it was his name. She repeated my name to him "Sofia".

After a couple of minutes she asked me if we were waiting for Lily the psychologist. I replied that yes, we were. "She told me that she would not arrive today until 11."

I had sent Lily by then a text message asking her if she was nearby, but the message stayed unseen. This time I considered calling her again and waiting until an answer. This second time she did pick the phone up. "Sofi, I am on my way". She was not upset nor mad but she sounded serious. I had just told Catherine how I hate being in a position where people depend on me when I depend on other people. Hearing the voice in her answer, made me feel that everything was my fault. Not much after, she arrived.

I applied some tests to the patient and finished the session at the closing of the hour. The ISRA is still unanswered. That could be the next session, would the MMPI be answered later?

She talked more than other patients. The usual last question that gives me an answer of no more than two minutes brought a conversation of almost 10. There were lots of mentions of family and the past. She spoke of the time as something to be dealt with, something that wears you down.

I had told Catherine I could go to her house after the session and accompany her to do the things she has to do. But when I finished the session I went to where Lily was cleaning and from there I could not leave. First she told me to wait and read something she had written. At first I thought it was for some of her closest friends, then she got to the part of our job team. Were we that close to her? I felt both flattered and, something else. It wasn't awkwardness. Was it sadness? No... Later I realized we were mention at the closing. We were addressed separately but noted in her little speech.

I helped her to redact it and send it to people. Robertonni, the other psychologist arrived as well. She introduced us. "Have you met in the university?" I told Catherine how I despised that question and the looks that Robertonni gave me, inspecting me, comparing me to his memories. Did he see me? Wasn't I a man?

I went to Catherine's and stayed at her home for a while. I drove her to the bank but it was way too full. We walked to the pharmacy for her to buy her anti-baby pills. Returning to her home I told her I would be coming back to mine. It's true that I had to confirm that my mom would pick my grandma, but it had something to do as well with her aunt parked there. Does she know about me? Did she see me at her parents' wedding? Would Liam?

I ran. I didn't want to know, not today.

For now I guess I'll sleep an hour before getting ready and leaving.

### 2016-12-10

The day after tomorrow I'll have to give the report of the evaluation to my patient and, before that, meet and start the evaluation with the new patient. She, is her a she?, is the trans patient that Lili told me so long about. Am I nervous about her? Lili talked me about her and asked me if I was ready. And yet, all the other patients are the one that have been harder.

Yesterday I slept a nap after my mother left home with my grandma. I went to bed and put the alarm to wake up at 6:30. Catherine had told me she would be waking up by 6pm. She had to shower and get ready. Easily I'd do easily with 30 minutes more of sleep. When my mom left I put on my black tights and over them the black pajama pants. I stayed in the black tank that I wore under the hoodie.

I closed and opened my eyes. It was dark and I was disoriented. I postponed the alarm clock thinking I had just rested 10 minutes. I was so tired and the headache hadn't subsided. Slowly I came back to my senses and realized the time it was. "It wasn't such a good idea to sleep" Catherine replied telling me she hadn't sleep at all.

The time we would meet at Paola's was going to be around 8. By then, the idea of asking for a ride from my parents was out. I would have to ask for an uber to take me there. I put six bottles of beer to a sack and put the potato salad outside the fridge. I put on my dress and applied my make up. My hair was messy but not that much. It was acceptable. Not enough to make me shower.

Talking with Catherine I asked her if her parents would drive her, and if they would, would they pick me up. She didn't know. She could ask them, her mother specifically. If she declined, or said something, maybe she could just let her at my house and from there we could share an uber.

An hour passed, around 7, or some minutes before 8 she told me they were on their way to here. Miguel was asleep on the couch. I fed Nymeria around 8 and put a note on my door. I felt ill, tired and the headache was light but annoying. Catherine's mom and mine came almost at the same time. When I received her text message notifying their presence, I left to meet my mother parking the red SUV. I waved and walked with the bags and tupper. "At what time will you come back?" Is it dusk or dawn? Which one is the breaking day and which is its end?.

I got into the car and Catherine asked me to step down again. We put everything on its place and left. I was nauseous on the way to Paola's. We arrived and Paola was inside. Paola S was with her as well. We chatted for a while and Diego, Paola's son, came out.

We told them about the date of our departure. February second. It's closer than ever. Having the date is pressuring. I see pictures of people in their trips, Gabriela in the city with her boyfriend, Sara coming and going from there, Hilda on her occasional trips. Why am I so nervous? Andrea, Ariel, Ivan, Paloma, lots of people went to stay, just as me. They made it. They came back, they loved it.

I did so, too. I went to a different country, I travelled to another continent. I was a foreigner and I made it.

None of us were trans. None of us had an id with a different name and a picture significantly different than how we looked.

I'll do it. I'll make it. I have to.

Rafa, Andie's boyfriend called. Chevo and Jessica were on their way. We moved downstairs and dinned. All of us were so hungry. The food was so delicious. But it tired us. It brought us down. We smoked and drank. We talked and laughed. We exchanged gifts. I gave mine to Rafa. I received from Paola S. She gave me a beanie hat and a bottle of wine. Cathy received a pair of cute loafs and Jessica loved her sweater.

It was a fun night, but my headache did not leave. We were the last to leave. Even Paola went upstairs before Chevo and Jessica and Cathy and me.

We cleaned up and waited for the uber to pick us up. Chevica waited with us. I got home and fell asleep before Catherine got to hers. I invited Nymeria to my bed and sleep through the night. In the morning she was the one to throw up instead of me. A blue rubber band tied some of her leftovers from her stomach. I threw it to the thrash and cleaned the sheet. We slept again until three in the afternoon that we got up for good.

In the morning Luis came to my room and asked me if I was going to the United States. I didn't even think about it before I declined. I think they bought some of the Christmas gifts. Grandma went as well. It's just less than a month that my sentri is valid. Just until my 24th birthday.

### 2016-12-11

Again I almost forgot about doing the words. Just now I'm returning from an open Excel workshop where I'm editing the appearance of the spreadsheet to interpret the psych tests. The flyer of the course is still online and I am still receiving some likes. People are interested but they don't pay or ask for the inscription. I am thinking about setting up some sort of offer. It's the Holidays. I could offer 20% off until the end of this year. That is an incentive to actually pay. There is a benefit for doing it before a certain date. And once you have made a payment, you force yourself to actually attend.

Even now I am still nervous. I fear that the day will come and I will have to cancel it because nobody will attend.

Yesterday I thought about sending a message to my patient to postpone tomorrow's meeting. It's the final one where I am going to give her the results of her evaluations. Tomorrow I'll pick Luis up. Tomorrow is the day when my parents will meet the sexologist as well. Had I forgotten about it? Am I nervous because of that?

I didn't want to sit and actually work. I don't have the motivation to finish grading the projective tests and redacting the report. This time I won't be having Lili by my side. This is my personal patient, I can do and say whatever I want. The only person that will judge me is her.

Today I woke up early in the morning and not much later my dad arrived with breakfast. I took the pill case and noticed how there wasn't no pink round pill. The Diane pills ran out yesterday and not today as I had thought. I skipped them for today. The first months I skipped them for four days. One won't do nothing. In a couple of days I will have to go to the lab to get my blood drawn. A week, maybe.

I remember years ago when even the thought of having to go to a place to be injected gave me panic attacks. Now it's just another appointment, other thing that I have to do. December is running out faster than all the other months. We're almost at its middle.

I drank a bottle of beer as I finished writing the conclusion of the report. The warmth of the drink as time passes brings me back the memories of the small caÃƒÂ±as and their taste on the terrazas when we would go out with Raul and Alberto to the park or for some pinchos. Did I drink to forget? Forget what? By then nothing had happened. Nothing at all. Then it was just the fear of what was ahead. I didn't lose anyone, I didn't confront nobody nor show myself to anybody. Then I enjoyed it. No, sometimes I did, like those. Other I wanted to drink to oblivion. When I went to the last botellones, or in Portugal as I danced with Monica's ghost.

It was returning that I pretended to be alright, that I buried everything deep enough and sealed it with the effects of alcohol.

Do I want to avoid L's situation the same way? I've been talking with Rene about approaching him. I don't dare to.

There are gifts wrapped on the stools of the bar in the kitchen. Yesterday they went to the United States and bought them. I saw several clothes. There was a box of several bottles of nail polish. Was it for my mom? She doesn't have much. Maybe they bought it for me. Even now as I'm typing I have my nails as red as wine. Sometimes I forget. I remember months ago that I worried my hands would catch much attention because of it. Now they seemed totally normal.

I asked my dad to buy me some Diana and antidepressants pills. He bought them when we went for the food. Is it me symbolically asking him to erase the man he thinks I am? He buys me the medication that I use to block the testosterone.

I've finished the report.

Yesterday, or was it the day before that?, I started looking for and downloading the music I've been listening in Spotify. More than 100 files are now in my Downloads folder. Now there are just three unfinished files and 5 connections that never even started. Should I delete those or just let them?

I like having the songs on my ipod.

The book is still unread. I have progressed more than as I used to with the other one, but it's not enough.

### 2016-12-12

All but three files have been downloaded. There is just one who's still not achievable, the other two are just incomplete.

I woke up in the early morning and Nymeria climbed my bed to get under the covers. I felt her warm body next to mine. I slept for another hour. Right besides me is my mason jar filled with beer and clamato. I don't have a reason to drink, I just fancied the taste. It's weird typing the daily words without a back sound, be it the music of the computer, or the conversations of the tv show that somebody watches in the living room. Just Nymeria and me are on the first floor. My parents returned but they are on the Oxxo. They went to buy eggs and tortillas.

I can hear their voices on the porche. They've arrived. They are here. "Do you want to go out?, do you want to go outside?" My father tells the dog playfully. He likes her. He said he didn't want any dogs and yet he cares for her.

I fed the dog as we got out of bed and I looked for some food on the kitchen. There were no packages of food, neither on the table nor next to the stove. In the napkin there was a stale tortilla and behind it a cold burrito wrapped inside a ziploc bag. I ate it. I tell myself I eat breakfast because of the pills, but really I am hungry. Do I deny my emotions as I do my wants and feelings?

We went back to bed to make use of the short time before I had to get ready to meet my new patient. I let her climb to my side and we both fell quickly to sleep. I showered and shaved.

I had mentioned to Catherine the weirdness of seeing my genitals. I described how in my morning routine, even before getting ready, even looking just as I get out of bed with my messy hair and puffy eyes, I look into the mirror and like what I see. I brush my teeth and find pleasing the image of the girl brushing, of the face behind the dry and frizzed curls. I take of my clothes and see the beginnings of curves, the subtle breasts that hang from my chest, the broadness of my thighs getting slimmer as approaching my feet. It's not until I take off my underwear that I see it, that I remember how I was born, how I should look or act or be.

This morning was different. I saw all of the barely noticeable traits of masculinity that are left, and every step of the way I kept thinking of what I didn't realize until seeing my genitals.

I met the patient. Were they a trans woman or man? I had assumed them to be a woman, Lili kept referring to them as feminine, the contact she passed me said Lucy. When she introduced us, they said that name themselves. I asked the question that some wouldn't had dared. "So, you are trans...". Even after some answers and half of the interview I kept thinking of him as a trans woman. It wasn't until he mentioned seeing himself and Lucas and liking that name, that I realized my mistake.

Some things should had touch some nerves in me. There were several parallels in his story to mine. The ages, the episodes, even some words. Everything went fine. I asked him, how he felt, how was it, the interview, me, everything. "Fine, good. I was really excited. I've never met somebody like me before."

Was I so noticeable? Is it that obvious? I felt the question grow in my throat but I grasped it. "So Lili told you since before", he just nodded and continued. We agreed on the price but he apologized for not having the money.

I came home. I felt energetic, motivated. I liked it, talking to someone like me, feeling experienced and helpful, even though I did nothing but listen and ask questions.

The Last man on earth was on the Tv when Miguel sent a message. He was asking if I were busy or if it was possible for me to pick him up. Even now, after months, I still feel weird when I read him use the feminine pronouns.

When we returned my mom was home. She said how she saw my aunt, my dad's sister. Maybe it was the picture of their anniversary or the change of appearance of my dad but my aunt asked a question that made my mother say how things have been difficult. They talked about how none of his siblings has reached out to him. It's hard for him. I had suspected it, known it, yet it was reassured when my mom told me how after asking him if he wanted to share a cake with them or visit, he said no. He didn't want to see them.

I went for Luis and entered his school. There was the principal and he recognized me. We stopped at the pharmacy before the office. I introduced him to Lili before my patient arrived. I delivered results and got paid. My parents didn't return until an hour after us.

Even now, I've been thinking about going out and asking my mom how it was, how their session went.

Is it that I don't want to, or that I don't dare to?

My grandma has come downstairs and sat with her. They're whispering. Is it that?

### 2016-12-13

Even after years, I never finished passing the journal I kept on my phone to the notebook. I think the last days I have are from my trip to Portugal. When I used to write manually the journal of when I was in high school, and meeting Monica, every time I would get caught up un the mood I had writing the text. Passing the scripts caused me numerous arguments and fights with my ex.

I am trying to fill the agenda that I bought on my birthday. Was it my birthday? It was in Playas, the Office depot next to the movies. The last day I have in there is from the mid of September. I have some batches ahead, but that's from where I should continue. I've closed the agenda now. Catherine and I are talking about tomorrow. Jhonny will have a concert or festival or something. We agree to go. This time I do want to go. The last time I wanted to. I can't remember why I cancelled it just one or two days before. I thought about returning from my therapy session to her house and be with her. I propose her that I could left my car in there until we return from Jhonny's and then I could go back home. Or she could pick me up. She said no, it's not possible. She has to come early to her home and I can't leave the car because they have to move it to put the truck in.

Moments now she asked me in which hotel we stayed when we went to Universal Studios. My parents just left to go to the bank.

I get this weird feeling when she mentions the park. We talked about going, the three of us. We talked about it since when I went with my family in April when she had her surgery. My ticket expires in a couple of days. We never really concreted the plans. Some weeks ago Anahi invited her to go the ninth. She felt bad that she could not go that day either because it was the day we all agree to meet for the Christmas party of the gang.

Catherine had told me she wanted to go with me and or her family, but going with Anahi felt weirdly uncomfortable. A couple of days ago she talked about buying the yearly pass when she goes with her family. I felt sad and disappointed. Why should she buy it if we're going to go to the capital in just two months?

Right, she returns.

I had the idea that I'd be going to the endocrinologist December the nineteenth. Chatting with Catherine I wondered what day could I stop by the lab to get my blood drawn. I could go Thursday or Friday, so I wouldn't go the weekend or have a problem with the results not being on time by the session.

I grabbed the order of the lab for something, and then mistakenly opened the prescription where the date of the appointment is written. It's noth the 19th but the 16th. It's not next Monday, but this Friday. Today is Tuesday. The tests are almost always the same day. But, what if they're late? I have to go tomorrow to the lab.

Moments before Rene called to postpone the session. Instead of going out at noon I will have to leave earlier than usual. I'll have to wake up in the early morning, like by 6 and get ready so I leave just after feeding the dog. What should I wear? What can I wear to Jhonny's? I thought about wearing a dress. Maybe the gray one with the long sleeves. Won't it be hard to free my arm for the needle? I won't make the same mistake of the first time that I went with androgynous clothes. I don't even want to see doubts in their eyes that I am a woman.

Thursday I'll see Rene and I can talk about my parents' session, or that the date is set for Luis to go. I can mention me taking them with me to the office or the misunderstanding of the dates of the appointment. It's just a little more than a week until Christmas. This Friday I'll meet the doctor and will have to tell him about my move. Will he recommend me to someone else? Will he ask me to return to meet him?

Why am I nervous?

The year is ending. Time is faster than ever.


### 2016-12-15

I cheated again in the words. Yesterday I was at the bar, sitting besides Catherine when I grabbed the phone from my purse and copy/pasted the word "cheat" while Jhonny was singing. Or was he still backstage and we were waiting?

I woke up early, earlier than usual, and showered. This time I applied make up. I wore a dress and boots. It's weird, when I catch myself in the moment living the experience of wearing tights and a dress, the flow-y cloth over my legs. I drove to the lab and got in. I would never believe the calmed I could be waiting to be called for my blood to get drawn. I even pay them. I walked towards the cashier and answered her questions. It felt amazing seeing how she wrote "female" on the gender box. I look female, I am a woman.

I don't really remember too well what I did yesterday. I have the agenda next to me, I filled today and yesterday. Then I could not remember and thought I needed this, now I feel the other way around. I was back home and ate breakfast. I would go out with Catherine, but not until later in the afternoon. I went to her house and picked her up. We made a stop at the exchange house and swapped seats. We decided to eat japanese food, Teriyaki and Yakimeshi.

I got distracted. I was on Facebook looking for Johana. Is that her name or was she called joanna? No, one was Monica's friend. The one I am thinking of had short hair, shorter than hair. She was tall and slimmer. She wore jeans every time she could, when the weather made the principal's office permit women to wear jeans like the men. Sometimes she would even look weird in her skirt. She wasn't really mocked or bullied, but people call her "the guy" behind her back. Usually people I disliked myself, sometimes people like Roger who called her group of friends the X-men, because of being geeky.

After seeing my patient I thought of her. Is she really a she? Her best friend, or the closest one I saw her with called her Johan. I never really related it or wondered if she were trans. Even after my own transition, I didn't really thought of her until Lucas explained to me that even though he hasn't asked his friends to use that name, his best male friend calls him Luke.

After eating we stopped in the River Plaza where we went to the movies. Christmas Party, was the movie we saw. It was nice, a nice time. Straight from there Cathy drove us to the bar where Jhonny would sing. I ordered a beer and she a drink with Clamato. Jhonny songs made me cry a little. I wanted to hug Catherine and feel her close to me. In my way back home after letting her at her house, I was stopped by the police checking for drunk drivers. I lowered the window when the car ahead of me was leaving. The officer didn't wave me off. He approached me and sniffed, "Did you drink alcohol tonight?" "No", I lied. There were just two bottles, but I know that's enough to tip me off. I wasn't drunk, I was driving just fine. "Where are you coming from? ...The Christmas party?" I giggled and replied no. Maybe it was because of the clothes I was wearing. "School?" Do I look that young? Well, people way older than me were with me at the university. I told him the truth, but he didn't hear me. He got closer. "I come from seeing a friend sing", I said making a microphone with my hands, mimicking jhonny's show. He let me go.

I went straight to bed.

No, I checked the results. I told Catherine how I felt uneasy about it. I was nervous, but not really sure about what. I opened them and saw there were not much over the limits. At first it was just uric acid, but then I saw the usual outliers. Cholesterol, Sugar levels. The last one was the most disconcerting. Testosterone. Last time I checked it lied at 0.28. Now it was 1.02. Almost twice the upper limit for a woman.

I felt sick, sick inside. I told Rene how it was like having this unwanted substance inside my body and I can't do anything about it.

Today I didn't wake as early, but it was still tiring. I went back to bed after the morning food and shit. I showered and got ready. I neither shaved nor wore make up. I even tried a male long sleeved t-shirt at first. But it was way too manly. I wore instead a pink t-shirt and over it a red hoodie. I felt fine until I looked at myself in the mirror after exiting my session. I saw the black hairs on my chin and upper lip.

The girl of the Oxxo recognized me again. I paid the bottle of soda and she told me how it was a miracle and how I've been doin'.

I stopped on the supermarket to buy the dog's food.

Today in the evening I hear the doorbell and thought it was my father. I opened the door and Nymeria walked out. It wasn't them but a courier. He asked for Jose Ivan Fernandez. Was he looking for him or was he confirming? Anyway I just nodded and he gave me a little machine to sign while I had the dog on my arms. In the envelope came my card. I activated it on the internet. I'm supposed to call on the phone but I'm not really sure I want to.

Tomorrow I'll se both the endo and then my patient.

I am scared and nervous. Will I explain my plans to him?

### 2016-12-16

I'm lying on my bed under the covers. I have already changed clothes into my black and cozier pajamas. The lights are off and Nymeria is asleep on her bed out in the living room. I'm tired and sleepy.

I'm writing the words in my phone incase I fall asleep and don't want to get up to do them. I worried about the level of my hormones and the results of my blood tests.

I woke up at the hour I was supposed to. I can't remember if it was before or because of the alarm clock. I showered and wore the clothes I chose yesterday. I would see Catherine in the afternoon. This time I decided to wear makeup. I wanted to look nice and feminine for the endocrinologist. I wanted him to notice the changes.

I looked fine, I like how I look, how I feel with myself.

I had all ready for both my appointment with the doctor and my patient. I left with everything and got into the car hiding under the rain.

I turned it on and when the little lights flashed I remember the times it cried with a buzzing alarm telling me there was a problem with the radiator or the water.

I returned to the house for a big glass of water to fill the car with. I unless dispensed it to its valve and got into it again.

I was just talking with Catherine telling her that I should be leaving in case there were traffic on my way there because of the rain. I was leaving the private drive and just turned to up the hill when the levels of both the speed and the revolutions died and fell to 0. instinctively I moved to the side and tried to turn it on again with no avail. I tried one more time with the same result. Two, three times as if suddenly it would get back to normal and everything would turn alright.

I had half an hour until the appointment. I called my dad and explained everything to him. He sounded a little shock but I didn't realized what he could had heard when he answered the phone and the first thing I said was "the car just died"

He said he'd be coming in 15 minutes.

I sent him a message telling him that I would not be arriving to my appointment with the doctor. In the phone call he asked me if I wanted to take an uber. I told him that u couldn't let the car in the middle of the road.

He arrived 5 minutes before my appointment. He tried to pass charge from his battery to mine wit jumper cables. It was useless. We moved the car to the side, first he did using the gravity and its weight from the uphill. He got halfway just from that. Next we pushed it into a U turn, when I got in and he pushed me with his pick up. We made it to the parking lot. He gave me a ride to the hospital and I signed in and got into the office. The secretary recognized me and told me, "you are very late, Sofia" I apologized and tried to explain that my car just died. "it's fine, take a seat"

The doctor passed me fifteen minutes later. How I've been, how I've been feeling, how's everything.

He weighted me and made notice of my gained weight. He took my heart pressure and my sugar levels, when he put the heart monitor on my chest he noticed my cleavage and moved the blouse to peek. He said the development was going very well, there was good volume.

The tests came ok, my blood is normal. He upped my dosage, I won't be resting the hormones anymore and I'll take double the spiro.

I left and paid. The uber I took to my office asked me if I was new using the app. Almost nobody has 5 stars, just the new users. I answer instinctively that I was not, and then thought about it. I've taken several trips, here, when we return from parties, all of the going outs in mexicali, those times that I had no car.

My patient waited for me fifteen minutes and we waited for lili another quarter.

I thought I could wait for Catherine to see her patient and then let her took me home. The patient cancelled and I called my mom to pick me up. After sending her a map and then guiding her over a phone call she arrived. We talked a little about their session. It was the first time that my father called me Sofia.

She told me why was she upset that Luis hadn't told her themselves, "I asked him, he said 'because I didn't want you to think I was a cheap copy of Sofia"

### 2016-12-17

Today will mark the 50 continues day again. Though, do I really deserve to be proud about that accomplishment? I cheated a couple of nights ago. Last times I considered doing double the words the next day to compensate, maybe that would be fair and enough. This time I didn't. I continued writing but stopped halfway. Yesterday was it that I did the words in my bed under the sheets with the intention of not having to get up later and being able to fall asleep right there and then.

Was then the day after the night that I went with Catherine to see Jhonny?

I'm eating hot bread with two slices of bologna in the middle. I keep thinking about the meeting with the endocrinologist and how I am overweight. I gained 5 kilos. I do have been eating more than usual. Is it the anxiety? All my life eating has been a way of resting, having an excuse for a break and free time. While I am eating, that is something I must do, I don't have the guilt of being procrastinating. Some times in my past I don't doubt I use it as a way of filling a void that I fell inside.

"Has it happened to you that you dream something and don't remember it later?" asked my grandma to Miguel in the morning. "All of the time".

I dreamed something today. It was a continuation of another old dream. I lived it and thought that it would be an amazing story. Something about returning to a different timeframe. I don't remember much of the details. There was a villain that had a big corporation of food, that used corpses as a main source. In another scene, I was part of the crew directing a movie or a tv show. I wasn't the director. The protagonist resembled one of the characters in the kid's show that I sometimes watch. She wasn't a gem projecting a humanoid form like in the cartoon. She just share the basics of her image. But there was something different. In the show she had a dark red wig of long and braided hair. I noticed her when she didn't wear it how her hair was straight and short, just brushing the edges of her face. It was framed by the black locks, and her freckles on her pale and snowy skin. I stopped the run of the scene and told her to take of her wig. She just had shared a moment with her significant other. Was I jealous? Would I had wanted to be hers?

I don't remember much more.

I got out of bed at seven o'clock. I fed the dog and let her outside. We returned to bed. In the middle of the night, just past midnight, I heard the sound of the door and a car leaving. My father didn't return until nine with breakfast. The idea of going to the United States was discarded. I don't mind. I can't imagine how it must be not sleeping a whole night at my father's age. Even now, at my own youth, I find it so hard to stay awake. I slept after breakfast for another three hours.

We didn't do anything. My father went to buy meat and we ate all at the table at the same time. A family dinner. I went upstairs to my mother's bedroom and both Luis and Miguel later got in, as well. My mother told me, my father had asked her what could they give me for Christmas. She asked me if I wanted a gift or would I prefer having some money deposited to my card in case of emergency or anything. I would not find a job soon. I don't even know if I would even look for one. I think of that and I get nervous and anxious. I will be alone. I don't know where I will live. I maybe should contact the agency that offers stay for LGBT people. I might have to start looking and browsing the roommates page of rents. Maybe after new year, a month before my departure.

Time keeps running as fast as ever. I should be starting to redact the letter of motives and polishing my resume to upload all of the papers. It's the master of science that I have until the first week of january to upload them. The other one I won't have to until I pass the test.

"How are you?" is just asking me Catherine now.

"Fine", I think, but that's a lie.

I'm nervous, and a little scared


### 2016-12-18

I bought a set of pajama pants red of Gryffindor. When I saw them I immediately thought of Catherine. We haven't chatted much today.

I woke up a little after seven. The cold was sharp and piercing. Like an ice prick that penetrates the clothes. We returned to bed and slept for another while. My father showered and came down. There was no breakfast. The plan since yesterday was that we would take DoÃƒÂ±a Cande to the bus station and from there we would cross the border to the United States.

I showered before my mother. I went upstairs and my father was changing clothes. I wore the pants that look like jeans, over them, the gray loose hoodie. I didn't bother to wear any make up. I reheated the biscuit from yesterday and ate it with my pills. I should separate the ones for next week. There is no need of resting anymore. I have to find another way to count the months. Just December, January and then the next month will be in another city. Will I have my anniversary of hormones in the capital, too?

We were in the US when my father asked some questions about the tests. Was he really interested? Did he have an ulterior motive? "When do you have the first exam? From which master program is it? And when is the second? Which one is the one you want the most?"

I can't stop thinking about two days ago when my mother told me that my dad called me Sofia for the first time.

Miguel called me Sofi when he tried to catch my attention. My father questions were in Hot Topic, and it was getting out of there that they walked towards Macy's.

Chula vista plaza was not the first place we went to.

Even though I am narrating today's itinerary I keep thinking about changing the appointments with my patients. I won't probably be able to see L this Friday because Lili said she would work until Thursday. And then, Monday that I am supposed to see L, I will be in Mexicali. Tomorrow I'll send Lili a message asking her about Friday. I will send two to my patients. I think about offering them to see them another day or just postponing them until next week.

Crossing the border we went to 5 guys. The last time we went there was almost two years ago, when Miguel was in Comic-con. My mother remembers that place as the one where they have peanuts and you can grab as many as you like. It's weird being in Hillcrest around my family.

We didn't take Cande to the station. We reconsidered taking her after returning so she could stay with Nymeria. And now that we've returned, she says that she'll go tomorrow.

Tomorrow my mom will take L to their appointment with the sexologist. I am more nervous than they are. We played two games of chess in their room. The first one they won and the second one, too. I am not as bad as I think, but they're way better than I would had thought. Before that I was in the restroom. I had seen a post in Facebook of a T-man who posted a picture of him before and after transition, he invited everyone else to share theirs, too, in the comments. I had seen the post when it didn't have any comments. I considered posting mine. I don't have earlier pictures than this year's. I had an idea. I have myself added in Facebook, I could snoop in there the older pictures from when my hair was shorter. I knew well that I won't be posting anything but it was more for myself than anything.

In Macy's, my mother caught up with us. She invited me to go see the women's section with her. It still feels a little strange buying clothes with her. I found several things. She did as well. When we finally return after she showed me a cardigan she had liked for me, she told me how Luis picked trousers just like my dad's. "That's what confuses me so much". I mentioned how it was similar with me, my clothes in high school, but she didn't seem to hear.

I took a picture of me while I waited for Nymeria to shit. I should clean her feces that are just outside the door. Done. I have changed. I look different, nice.

My father gave me the money of the week. Maybe I'll get the extra one from the sessions, if I don't postpone them.

### 2016-12-19

Today is the day of the first session of Luis. I don't know what happened in there, I don't know what was said or what new has developed. What happened besides that today?

I have red marks of the scratches of both teeth and nails of the dog. She's so caring and affective and yet at the same time so full of emotion and childish anger. Was it last night or the one before when she climbed the bed and yet some time after returned to her own? Did I feel abandoned?

Catherine told me today how she's planning of going to the doctor tomorrow. She doesn't feel very well. She's been experiencing nausea and a ringing in her ear. Now as I type this I wonder if going to the kitchen for something to drink is a good idea. I think I'm beginning to feel a soreness in my throat. I'm getting the hang of rating the songs. I'm almost finished with this album. The School. The song that was the reason I downloaded this band is the last one. I deleted the other album I had gotten.

I slept again after taking the dog outside. I ate my breakfast and took my pills later in the morning. It's weird not being lonelier in the house. Almost everyone was here. My mom, my grandma and Luis. They had talked about taking my grandma to Mexicali today instead of yesterday. The wind ran furious and piercing. It was like an ice dagger that passed through clothes and bones. I guess that is why they decided to try something else. My mom sent a copy of the prescription to my uncle. He could try to exchange it in the hospital there. It didn't work. Tomorrow they will try going to a clinic here.

I sent the messages and arranged the appointments. I sent a message to L, my male patient, that I would not be able to see him this monday and if it would be possible to arrange another appointment this week. He said it was no problem, could it be Friday?

There was a problem, I didn't know yet if Lili would work that day. I was thinking about setting him and asking my other patient if I could see her Thursday, too. Maybe if I put her to 10 and him to 11, I wouldn't interfere with Iris at noon. Lili answered the message back telling me it was no problem and she could open the office for me in the morning. So it was all set and done. It was even a little hard to believe it myself. And then the patient sent the question. Would it be possible if we could lower the price to 250?

He wouldn't be the first one to pay me that much. Why was it so hard for me to accept? I had thought about cashing the 300 pesos from him. They would be all for me. And yet it was done, and I could not accept it. I told him that 300 was the lowest I could go, and asked him again if he had problems getting that amount. He said he had, but it was no problem. It was done, I wouldn't be losing it, and yet... why did I feel defeated?

It's almost Christmas. The day after tomorrow I will be turning eight months on hormones. The days I have left until the deadline for uploading the documents are fewer and fewer. I haven't even started to think about what I'm going to write in my motive's letter. What motives do I even have?

Thinking about writing in the masculine and signing it with my name feels so wrong and difficult. Yesterday in the United States my mom showed me several formal pants in the women's section. I saw them but not considered buying them. Does she know I have to wear them for my interview? Maybe I can set it up to being online, that way they would only be chatting and seeing me from my chest up. Will be breasts be bigger? Enough to be unnoticeable?
It depends on everything, what happens in the capital, how the getting into and out of the test goes. It's just all too much.

I told 11 I would be going the day of their birthday. I had mentioned yesterday, but they thought I was joking.

Will they, all of them, really miss me? Who will miss whom the most?

### 2016-12-20

Catherine came and went. Yesterday we agreed of meeting today, we could do something cheap without paying anything. She came with the idea of coming home, but rectified herself saying she knows how I am not really comfortable staying home. It was yesterday in fact that I passed several weeks to the agenda, just that same week or couple of days of cancelled meetings and gatherings and postponed plans and void days. It was like a confirmation of that reaffirmed memories. I don't feel the same way. I told her it was fine. Today after showering I told Luis about moving the wii downstairs, maybe we could all play together.

It was a fun day, Luis was more talkative and open. All of us had fun. She brought a jicama and we chopped the fruit to mix it with the chips and the clam juice. We mixed the juice and some sauces with the beer. I just now remembered that I left half of a bottle in the fridge, could I grab it and drink it? Alcohol is not good for losing weight. I've been eating less these last few days. I put on one of the sweaters my mother bought me in Macy's. I wore it today with the red leggings. Catherine told me, as soon as she saw me, that I looked weird, different. Later in the day when I told my mother we would go out she asked me if I was going to leave "like that".

I got really distracted. I am just returning from playing with Luis and opening the chat with Cathy. Luis was just here talking and laughing, I had to kick them out so I could continue with my words. Tomorrow we might go to Costco according to my mom. I had thought how I didn't really want to get ready and go out.

I keep forgetting and thinking that tomorrow is when I'll see Rene. It's not. I won't see him until Thursday. My car is still in the mechanic. Tomorrow then we will probably go to the Costco to buy my grandma her medicines and probably use the opportunity to refill mine. Thursday I will go to Rene, I don't know if I'll ask my mom to give me a ride or lend me her car. This Friday I'll see my patients and go out with Catherine somewhere to eat and exchange gifts.

I keep drifting away, when it's not the music and the recently downloaded songs, it's looking for something on the internet, or, like days before, scrolling through the pictures un the albums inside of my computer.

Again I drifted and started playing the songs I already know or recognize and use the little tool that gathers the lyrics from the web and shows me which are the most popular songs of that artists. From there I pick the ones I have and listen to them for the first time. I see the blank stars as something to fill, a to-do, a task that's still undone and waiting.

I wish to just get up and change clothes. I want to wear my pajamas and lie on the bed. Nymeria is finally asleep on hers.

Catherine got here around two, after I had played twice or three times chess with Luis, one of them was with the clock he likes so much to use. Then I asked him to play checkers and won most of the sets. We played videogames and ate. She told me herself how Luis seemed more open. The afternoon past quickly. It was then that we went to the burger place of Hollywood looks. Both me and Catherine entered first and one of the cooks or waiters said "Welcome, girls". It was reassuring and calming. We didn't find a parking spot in front of the joins so Catherine kept driving another block and left the car there. I used the vanity mirror and looked at myself worried of how I looked. I am wearing feminine clothes, a girly sweater over red jeggings. But I am not wearing any make up and my shaving wasn't spotless.

Four days until Christmas. Tomorrow is twenty-first, Thursday and Friday and we'll go to Mexicali. "What are you going to wear?", asked me my mom. My brothers and father are going to wear pants and a shirt. What am I going to wear indeed? I thought about wearing the red blouse she bought me, and then again I could wear the gray dress. Maybe I'll wear one this Saturday and the other the Sunday.

I still have to decide what am I going to wear to see both of my patients and Catherine. I should try to look pretty for her. Looking pretty, when would I ever imagine that I would be worrying about that, or even enunciating those words?

### 2016-12-21

This was supposed to be an unworthy day where nothing would happen and I'd do nothing. I wore for the firs time the artesanal sweater Catherine's parents brought me from their holidays in Zacatecas. As soon as I put it on I realized it wasn't such a good idea. The weather for today wasn't as windy nor cold as the past few days. Before that, a little after eating the three tacos my grandma had prepared me, I was still in pajamas when my mother said that Miguel had just sent her a message asking if she could go pick him up. My father said something yesterday about leaving the pick up and taking with him the Mitsubishi as the brake plates were squeaking and really worn down.

I guess she forgot about it because it was a surprise to her that she would be driving the pick up. She asked me to take it. She accompanied me to show me the way. We left the house both in our sleeping garments. "I think I'm not even wearing a bra, she said to me" "Well, me neither", I thought about saying, but decided not to.

We returned and I went to shower. She would enter to the bathroom after me. We planned since yesterday about going to the Costco to buy the pills and medicine they didn't want to give my grandma in the hospital. It was then that I sat and played with Luis after wearing my new hoodie, or is it a parka?, I noticed how every time that they won me they were using the white chips. I swapped them and again won.

We played chess but they won the two times. After a couple of days ago that I watched the second movie of Star wars, that one that I have tried several times to finish but never got to, I remember the chess game that I had in the computer that used the characters as the pieces. It's fun playing with them. More than the challenge of knowing the most probable outcome is my loss or the thrill of actually believing I can really win that time, it's something else entirely. Even remembering of that old game of my past, a little part of me wishes to look for it on the internet and find myself a copy.

There is another memory of that movie. I was sitting in M's house, in the old room of her brother, we were sharing the couch and film was playing on the screen. Was it the computer or a dvd? Was it a blu ray? How many minutes actually past before we ignored it entirely? Does she think sometimes of those memories? What feelings would accompany them? What feelings do I experience thinking about that time myself?

Before going to Costco, My mother was upstairs with my grandma talking about something. Were they arguing? As I entered my mother said to me with the intention of introducing me to the subject of their conversation and with a face trying to share the absurdity of it: "She says the only medicine missing is the antidepressants and she won't take them". My grandma said that it wasn't that entirely but that she had some in her home and she would wait until arriving there. I told my mom to go to the Costco and buy everything. The pills didn't cost more than 20 pesos each box.

We left but she told me that first we must stop at the bank. I drove there and got down with her. Luis stayed in the car. At first I sat in the couch of the waiting area as my mother approached the window when the upper screen showed her number. A couple of minutes I noticed that they were still talking and then another person approached her. She told me to go with her and we passed with the manager. Supposedly she was going to open a savings account or something like that. Did he say something to imply my gender? My mother called me Sofia with him and there was no answer on his part. It wasn't until we moved to the other teller, that she welcomed me with a "miss".

When everything concluded then an hour later, she said bye with the same calling. In Costco we bought several things and the medicines for both my grandma and me. The car was ready and I drove the pick up to the mechanic where my father was waiting. Tomorrow I'll talk with Rene.

There are some videos right now about a trans woman who's been arrested and is being processed as a man.

Why am I watching this?



### 2016-12-22

I left today for my session with Rene. I know I had several dreams. Again they had something to do with school, with a class. Was I wearing a skirt in them? I remember the sensation of having to seat and be careful of the opening of my legs. It's so bizarre having experiences of what I should had experience as a child in my dreams. I recall as well, the image of myself having my hair tied in a high ponytail with a red colored hairband.

I woke up early at six, but didn't move. I let Nymeria get comfortable again over my legs and both of us returned to sleep. I had the alarm clock set for a quarter after seven. I fed her and let her do her business inside. At first I guided her outside but noticed that the floor was soaking wet, she just peed and I urged her to return. I ate a hot dog and swallowed my pills with a glass of tea.

The next alarm was set to a quarter before ten. I moved it around and ended up not using it. Were my mom and grandma up when I got out of bed? I think so. What did I wore today? I was planning to wear my Salamanca hoodie. I went to shower and wore the jeans-looking-leggings and an Ivan's undershirt. I barely shaved my face with my razor machine and came downstairs. My mother whistled at me as I entered my room. "Those legs" I heard her comment to my grandma. "I remember when she had those skinny little legs...". I went into my bedroom and tried to comb my hair with my fingers and put mousse.

I took the sweatshirt and put it on. I didn't like it. I looked weird and huge. The sleeves were short and the sweatshirt itself barely reached the waist of my trousers. I looked like a grown up wearing a garment from their childhood. It was fitting the thought of my trying to put on something symbolically from a past era of my life. I took it off after just a glance at the mirror and decided to wear the purple sweater. I didn't realize it until later, but everythin over my waist but the bra was masculine. Even my shoes were something I wore when I presented as Ivan. The only thing feminine in my attire were my underwear and the fitting trousers. I didn't even wore make up.

My mother was supposed to go out and meet with my godmother and Luis had plans too with his friends of going to the movies and seeing the Star Wars flick. Neither of them even took off their pajamas.

I left the house a couple of minutes after eleven. I stopped by the gas station. The dispatcher received me and served me. He didn't use any gendered words, except saying "servido" when all was set and done. Months ago, the first time that I heard that word Catherine killed my excitement when I told her I had been said that word but in feminine. "They always say it like that, they mean the gasoline is served".

I parked in the parking lot in front of Rene's office to avoid walking in the rain. I got into his floor and rang the bell. One of his patients came out with him some minutes later after I rediscovered the chess game in my phone. The session went normally. I guess I seemed happier and more energetic than other times. At least that was how I perceived myself. I returned to my car and paid the fare. The guy who was attending the booth wished me a good day and ended with a seÃƒÂ±o... I couldn't hear the rest. Was it a sir? A Misses? Did he stop himself?

It was then that I took notice of my appearance and clothes. I had no right to be upset. It was a direct consequence of my actions. Yesterday I turned 8 months on hormones. Two thirds of a year. Time is running so fast that it's disorienting.

I stop at Galerias plaza and entered Wal-mart. I bought two pairs of tights, two packets of dog treats and a nail clipper for the dog. That same clipper I had avoided before was the one that I miss-use and caused Nymeria's paw to soak in blood. I rushed her to the vet and paid the consult.

L sent me a message asking about tomorrow's session saying Lili had told her that she would not go anymore except the first days of next week. It ruined all of the plans I had set with her and my other patient. I tried to organize that situation at the same time that Nymeria bit off her bandages and I wrestled with her and struggle to take of the tape pasted to her hairy leg.

Tomorrow I'll see both of them and then, later in the afternoon I'll see Catherine. I'll give her MuÃƒÂ±eca's clothes and her gift. She has one for me. I had actually forgotten about that.

I love the feeling of being more excited about seeing her than knowing what she got for me.

### 2016-12-23

I already had around a hundred words in this fucking page. Just now, after returning from the tab of Facebook where Anahi is spamming my Timeline the window was not framed correctly. I refreshed the site and my whole progress just deleted. To think that just some time ago I was seeing the posts in Catherine's page and felt jealousy of them.

I closed the tab. Nymeria just farted and a fetid smell of shit knocked my face. A couple of minutes ago, maybe an hour, there were skid-marks on the floor and a similar smell became noticeable. A small piece of feces got caught in one of the chair's wheels and it was spread all around the floor.

In the last page before the refresh I was just narrating the dream Catherine had about both me and my ex. She had come to me for a talk, was she trying to make amends? I don't know. She asked or offered a hug after looking at Catherine in some sort of permission asking. "Meh, whatever", was the signal Catherine showed back. I put my arms around her neck. "No, not like that", she corrected me. "Is she being serious?", both Catherine and Anahi, who were standing nearby giving us some space and privacy, looked at each other in disbelief.

The dream ended some time around there. "Did I already look like a girl?", was the first question that came to my mind. Monica and I, while in our relationship, argued and separated countless of times. It didn't matter the reason or cause, after an e-mail or a call, we always made amends. It was a common issue with us that she was not able of ever putting boundaries. Wether it was with her last ex Rodrigo who kept threatening her with suicide, or Benny and the gang of lovers who kept asking her out on dates or almost harassing her, or her current boyfriend who, by then, was actually harassing her and following her around. They were all deleted once and then re-added again. They always came back. Even her first boyfriend who supposedly betrayed her friendship and saw another girl behind her back, he was the contact whom she asked me to give her stuff with.

Ivan is gone. He'll stay gone. Is it really even imaginable that Monica would care about me?

I saw both of my patients this morning. Lo sent me a text saying there was a problem with a tire of her car and she would be late to the session. I answered back there would be no problem. She came just 10 minutes after the set time. She didn't end the test until half an hour into the session of my next patient.

He brought the money, but just half of the part from last week.

I stopped by the tortilla shop to buy the stuff my mother asked me for on my way back. Then she sent me again for the stuff she didn't know was missing.

Catherine picked me up in the afternoon. We went to eat pizza at Playas and then saw the Star Wars movie.

My mom told me before leaving how my grandpa had called and said he wanted to meet us and say hi tomorrow, in the early morning by the airport. At first, I thought and went straight to the obvious question, but said nothing. She said it in a way of asking what I thought, as if it was just a possibility.

When I returned she mentioned it again as a matter of fact. I asked the question, to confirm what I worried.

"Does Carlos know about me?"

"No", I let the emotion show in my face. "When? At what time?", she said excusing herself. It's not her duty to tell anyone. I don't have contact with him. She is his daughter. Is he my grandfather, though? I can't even remember the last time I saw him. What's the point in showing myself and explaining to someone whom I won't see for another several years?

I had the feeling that somehow it was all my fault. It is my duty to tell the people. "It's not something to be said by the phone", my mom said. It's not something to explain at the airport, either. No matter how much I think about it. There is nothing I could had done.

In Playas I mentioned the elephant in my and Catherine's room. She whine about her job and I told her how she is still there because she wants to. She has the opportunity to leave but doesn't want to. She can come with me to the capital and do something she likes, but she prefers to stay here. She repeated herself. And the emotion came back. I think I ruined my night right then and there.

I resent her for having a high paying job, I resent her for being normal and not having to deal with the things I do. I resent her for not helping me when I need her.

Those are stupid reasons and not valid, how can I say them out loud, how can I tell her?

They are irrational, but they are.

### 2016-12-26

I'm home again after the Christmas holidays. It's been three long days. The first one, two nights ago, before we even left. My mother woke me up around 6 in the morning opening the door of my room to tell me that Carlos had arrived earlier, he was already at the airport. "Do you want to go?" "No, not really". I told her truthfully. I'm not sure if it's regret what I'm feeling. It'd would be nice seeing a reaction, something. I don't think I want to tell him myself, though. They returned one or two hours later. Nymeria didn't want to eat. The food was still in her plate.

We got ready and made the baggage. We left around noon. There were gifts in the bag that lies on the roof of the car and the trunk was filled completely. We were in the 5&10 lane when Miguel told my mom how they had forgotten about the cakes. My father asked if we wanted to return.

Who was it? I think it was my mom who mentioned how my godmother had sent her a text message telling her that the Rumorosa was closed because of the snow.

I got distracted again seeing the pictures. It was from the beginning of my transition, the first appointment with the endocrinologist. I left around my trip to Guadalajara with my parents. No, the first picture I saw today was in the Universal Studios. Catherine will finally go there with her family in a couple of days. The 28th or 29th is supposed to be the get-around of the office. Catherine will be in Hollywood by then.

I got the flight ready for my departure in a just a little days more than a month. I have, have to scan and upload the documents and continue with the studying. I can't let more days go by. Tomorrow I'll work on the evaluations and scan the documents. I can't let more time pass...

We returned home to pick up the forgotten cakes. I remembered about Nymeria's certificate of vaccines in case we were to cross the border. As we, my mom and I, were to go out again, I saw the pill organizer in the table. I had forgotten it. It was good then that we returned.

We spent all of Christmas eve with my uncle. This time wasn't as fluid and alright as the one before. It was messy and awkward. Some slips of pronouns and several mentions of "Ivan". Everyone hurt a little more than the one before. Still, the night was enjoyable. Time passed and midnight came upon us. It was time to open the presents. It's not as exciting as when I was a child. It's not that I don't enjoy opening the boxes or the thrill of trying to figure out what the contents are. It's not a learned state of un-materialism. I am thankful of what my parents are going to do for me. They'll help me settle there and pay for the trip. Miguel got his iphone. The comments, not necessarily in bad faith, of "losing him" or disowning him because he now has apple products was painful to hear. I couldn't help but compare the sentiment with being different, with being like myself. I tried to ignore them. Even though I told my parents not to give me anything and just make the deposit, I opened various gifts. The ones I knew about like the shit pillow or the hot dog one, and the Harry Potter pajamas; some I theorized but weren't really sure, like the box of nail polishes. And some that were completely surprising, like the pajama set I'm wearing as of right now or the 3ds game that Luis gave me in a simple wrapping with the words: "you can keep the 3ds and take it with you to Mexico city".

I was tired, I wanted to go to bed. I cleaned my face and got my change of clothes ready when I heard a knocking on the door. I looked through the peephole and it was my other uncle and his family. They got in and greeted me normally. They stayed for a while. Karl's boyfriend came as well. She introduced me as Sofia. I extended my cheek and he approached it. Does he know about me? Can he tell?

I went to sleep as soon as they left and my uncle and aunt went upstairs.

The next day I got up and showered early. I was eager to put on the new outfit that I bought with my mother. The pants and blouse would hide the unflattering curves that made me so uncomfortable the day before and were really obvious with the gray dress.

After noon we went to my aunt's house, the place where Nymeria was born. It's awkward getting asked about her name. "You named her in a really weird way, right?". They called me just as much m'ija as they used m'ijo. They sometimes said Sofia and others mumbled Ivan. The first half of the day I let it happen and ignored it.

Teo introduced me to his girlfriend. "Do you know each other?" He questioned. I didn't answer trying to think and her looked a little troubled saying: "yeah, but, uh..." I didn't got what she meant until way later. We had met before indeed. She came to my house, she slept in my bed. I picked them up from the consulate. But I looked different. I dressed differently. I was different. That was what she meant.

Some time after in the afternoon, I think it was after hitting the piÃƒÂ±ata, we left to visit my uncle Alex. He invited us to his house with his wife. It was nice seeing them together. I haven't interacted much with his wife. I carried Nymeria without know what to do. Could we enter? Could I put her down on the floor? When I noticed neither of them made any mention of my clothes or appearance, those were the anxieties that troubled me. It was a relief when my uncle told my father they had a dog as well. No, it was my aunt that said it first. My uncle told us she was named Khalessi. That was a similar natured, but different relief.

It was when we returned again to my aunt's house that I felt it too much. I saw the sights, I heard the slips of tongue. Teo told Karla and her boyfriend about the dog, how caring they were to them "until they left and our happiness went away with him". I saw the face of the boyfriend, Louis I thinks he's called, and felt humiliated. My uncle Beto said bye and called me Ivan. My father had asked me to confirm the address of my uncle in the phone "Check it in the map, Ivan".

I felt tired, exhausted. I wanted to go home where I would not hear that name again. I wanted to sleep and cry. I asked my mom to leave. She said she'd wash some dishes and we could go. We didn't exit the house until around 45 minutes later. Even then my siblings and father waited with me outside for another 10.

In the car my grandma noticed there was something bothering me, but I hid with my earphones. I heard the music and cried silently looking out the window. Ivan was still in my ears. The doubts burned me inside. The insecurity, self-hate and fear.

When we finally got home, I changed into my sleep attire, set the bed with my earphones and covered my face with the pillow. I hugged Nymeria and cried until my eyes were dry and my mind went numb. Not much later I fell asleep.

Today we came home. I bought the ticket to the capital. It's bought, it's set. The date is finally set in stone. It hurts putting a different name, an old and forbidden one. Will there be any trouble in the airport when I show my id? I hope not. Will I hide in fear in male clothing?


### 2016-12-27

My aunt and uncle are here in my living room. They came as they said they would in Christmas. In a couple of hours we'll cross the border to give a ride to my cousin to the airport. He'll take a flight to Portland to visit his long distance girlfriend. Just a couple of minutes ago I saw the message from Iris. In it she asks me where did I change my pesos to euros. And if there was an issue withdrawing money from the ATM if the account is in pesos. She, as well, will go and meet his long distance boyfriend next month. Some day of January I think.

Yesterday I bought the flight ticket to the capital. A one-way ticket to Mexico City.

Today I played the Christmas special of Sense8, but remembered that Catherine had mentioned it and told me to watch it together. I paused it and put The OA instead. I watched just a couple of minutes.

Not much later my father arrived with the pizzas and I stopped it. Then, a little after, my uncle came with his family.

I showered Nymeria today. I let her into the shower without clothes and with a bucket filled with hot water. I took off my pajama pants and washed her. She looks way whiter and cleaner now.

I haven't counted my money. I have more dollars than I thought I would. My father gave me the allowance of the week and I have the 500 pesos my mother gave me for Christmas. When I showered and put on one of the new blouses that I bought with her in Macy's I considered cleaning my nails and painting them with one of the new colors. Maybe tomorrow.

Tomorrow we will go to the bank to make the deposit. I wonder of how much will it be. I told my mom about going to the sex shop to buy my godmother the gift she told me about yesterday. No, the day before. We were in the house of my aunt Cruz when she asked me again. She had said that she had made a mention of giving a sex toy to her being playful and I asked her why she wouldn't. She considered it and then asked me if I could accompany her to pick one.

In Facebook I had seen a post about a course of psychometric tests being given by a psychologist who works in the Mental Health Hospital. It didn't show any syllabus or table contents. The price was just as mine but I lack half of the preparations of the facilitator. Today I saw the post again, except this time it had countless comments asking for information and how to sign in.

Now I don't really know if it will actually happen. Several people asked me for information but not a single one has said something about confirming their assistance.

Will I accompany my parents and aunt to the airport? Around an hour ago my father said he would go lie down and sleep a little. Before stepping the stairs he looked at me and asked if I would go with them. I looked at my mom with a face showing doubt. "I don't know", I told him... "Do you want to go?" "Sure".

I feel like going to the bathroom. These last few days I haven't gone normally. I feel bloated and fat.

Nymeria is bitting the border of the bed making scratching noises. I can't concentrate with the words. I'll do something.

I asked her to get up to my bed, but instead I used the dark red blanket to wrap her into. She is there now, calm.

She has her head out of the blanket just enough to continue bitting.

I used one of the pictures that my mother uploaded from Christmas as my new profile picture. I hear the noises of the notifications in Facebook telling me how there are some new, something, maybe comments, probably likes.

There are days when I looked at some pictures of mine or even my own reflection and I don't understand how anyone would ever gender me female. I see my face and can't blame my relatives or my father for keep using an outdated name. There are others, though, when I see that face, and specially that smile, and I get it. I get it why I did it. How I decided to get this way, to fight for what I want, for who I am.

### 2016-12-28

How can I type my words and eat cheetos at the same time? Is it even possible?

This is the second night I've slept in my bed since Christmas. It wasn't this one that I dreamed with my ex. I had a wet dream with her the one before, I guess. There was something about the dentist and a parking lot of several levels and a body thrown and ignored. I can't remember the context of the encounter. I was with her, I recognized her face. I knew it was a dream and it wasn't real. I took advantage of it. Did I enjoy it? Was I a man in the dream?

It was only wet in the name. I reached an orgasm but there was nothing material that could serve as evidence. After the morning I well could had let the dream be forgotten and it would be as if it hadn't happened. Can't I say the same about our relationship? The only thing that remains are the memories. Could I let them go, it would be as if it never were.

Yesterday I finished the words while my uncle and aunt were outside in the living room. I did went with them. It was just my parents, my aunt and cousin and me. We left around one in the morning. My father did sleep a little. My mother and aunt just got into the bed but reached no slumber. Did I even try?

Time came and my mother opened my door. I took my purse and coat and went outside. My aunt was still in pajamas, she just changed and we all left.

The way to the border was dark and calm. We reached it in no time. The lines were short and quick. We stopped by the booth and a female patrol officer dispatched us. She reached for our cards and examined them. I got the same nervousness I feel when I wait for them to make a question or state a comment about my appearance. Nothing happened and nothing was said. She asked where would we be going and for what. My father told her the truth and we went on our way.

He stopped by a gas station and we saw a young man in just a short sleeved shirt. We were all wrapped in coats and scarves and gloves.

We got to the airport around 2 in the morning. The flight would depart by 6 and a half. Not even the checking in stations were open. We sat and wait. There were some people lying on the chairs sleeping and waiting. We talked. My mother kept making comments or references about the emotions my aunt would be experiencing. Eric was nervous and excited. But his emotions were unexpressed. It was, weird, being in there again. I hadn't returned to the airport since my trip to Europe, and then my return.

I left Mexico as a trans girl pretending to be a normal boy. I returned as Sofia disguised as Ivan, even to herself.

I didn't get to finish the review of the pictures. Around July the software keeps crashing. I saw the messages of my first days there. Even then, when months of being out publicly as me and being referred in the feminine by family, friends and strangers, there was certain warmth in the words of Catherine.

In the waiting area I was nostalgic. I kept returning to the thought that I'll be reliving soon the experience of leaving home for a long time. Of traveling to the unexplored and new and scary.

Eric checked in and we all waited outside the security area for him to pass. We returned home and arrived around six in the morning. The sun was barely showing in the horizon when we got in. I lied down with Nymeria and we both slept for the rest of the night. This morning they returned to Mexicali. I guess the same routine of Christmas will repeat this New year. We'll go celebrate the holiday with them, return a day later and receive them in our home the day after. This time we will pick him up. Instead of being dusk we'll receive him in the evening. And then, exactly a month later, my parents and siblings will say their good bye's to me.

Ivan left a long time ago. I'm going to Mexico to finally erase him. To move on, to live my life. To start it, finally.

Today my mother made the deposit to my account. I have money, some. I still don't feel ready.

### 2016-12-29

I'm ready to leave. I guess I should finish the words before asking for the ride. "Interpsique party" was written for yesterday in the agenda. When I transcripted the important dates to the notebook I got into it. The date was wrong. The party is today's Thursday instead of Wednesday. Catherine said she was not able to go because she'd be out of the city, so it was moved to today.

I am all changed and set. I showered in the morning to go see Rene. Nymeria didn't wake up by 7 anymore. The alarm sounded first and we stayed asleep. I postponed it several times, from 8 to 10. Again Nymeria hesitated before eating. I let her.

I talked normally with Rene. There were several things to mention like the trip to Mexicali this Christmas and the reactions of everybody. My crying in the living room after not being able to deal with the dysphoria. I talked a little about my family dynamics and the relationship with my father and his own relationships with his siblings. When I got out I heard the sound of paper bags but I was mistaken. There was no breakfast. I left the house around eleven fasting. I drank a glass of tea with my pills. My hormones and antidepressants were my meal for the day.

I feel more dysphoric than before. Even now with eyeshadow and lipstick and other make up, I took a picture to send to Catherine and I struggle with the image of him.

I dreamed with Monica.

Yesterda. There was something I did not write about. I had written when it happened. I used my mother's computer to pass the pictures. In it, I guessed I could use her facebook to send them to my uncle. When I opened it, instead of stumbling up on her picture as I told Rene, I looked for her. I opened her profile and lurk there in the latests news of her life. I saw her most recent pictures.

And I felt like shit.

The last one even had my mom's like with the fifty something other people. I mentioned to Rene how it was like some sort of treason. She's my ex, why would she like it. And on Monica's side, why hasn't she deleted her? She said she doesn't want to know nothing about me. Maybe that's why. She doesn't want to, so she doesn't look. She has the pictures but she doesn't look, she doesn't care.

Even months later I still am writing about her and I did look for her.

I had dreamed with her a couple of days ago and I dreamed of her again.

Catherine was in the dream, too, but I think I've forgotten her part and most of the context. We looked around in some kind of food place, she wanted to buy something to eat before school. We were in school, was it university or high school? Were there any uniforms? What was I wearing? How was I dressed?

In the market Catherine wandered around but ended up not buying anything because the clerk who handled the food admitted to have just farted.

It's seven pm, the hour Robertoni had posted in the message group that the meeting would start. I had said how tardiness was one of the things I couldn't deal with in people and yet I will be late.

I'll be going without Catherine. I asked her, but she said she was really tired. She preferred going out tomorrow with me. I know if I had left 20 minutes ago, I would had arrived on time, but probably I would had to enter alone.

Am I nervous about being carded? Have I been carded lately?

In the dream that was the last of Catherine. The next scene I was inside a classroom, just getting in and taking a seat. I had seen how Monica had taken or was just to take on besides or behind me. When I grabbed a seat for the missing spot, someone told me how she had moved. We had just talked in my dream. Was it some kind of memory or did we really chatted?

I remember seeing her and wondering if she was mad with me. I saw my phone and somehow I knew I didn't had there anymore. I had deleted her contact just as I did months ago. Was it reason enough to add her again and ask her what was going on? We were just talking moments ago. Maybe everything was left behind for a moment.

But it hasn't. We haven't talked. We won't.

I'll go to a party and drink.
