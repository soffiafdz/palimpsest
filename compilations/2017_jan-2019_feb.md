## 2017-01-01

Yesterday I forgot again to write the words. I was in the United States sitting in the couch watching a movie, was it midnight already or did I give up to the thought of cheating? If I was on the couch watching a movie it was probably after midnight.

The night was easy-going and nice. We leave the house around noon or a couple hours after. Was it that day that I had the argument with Catherine? No, that was Friday when she cancelled our plans. I guess I wrote about it that day. There's no point in repeating all of that again.

Yesterday we continued our silence. The last messages we exchanged the day before it was around 6 in the afternoon that she asked me something after I had just woken up. Nobody continued the conversation. If it had ended up on me, I don't think I would had sent her something on New Year's.

Outside in the dinning room my mother and grandma are talking about Mexicali, I guess something happened with my aunt. "You know when she changed? when I called "Sofia"", I heard my name and paused the music and paid attention. What was that about? They were talking about my aunt Luisa, I guess.

Thankfully it didn't get to that. Catherine sent me a message in the afternoon, asking if we were already in Mexicali. I answered her. The conversation didn't advance further. She told me how she felt ill. Food poisoning. Was that like a reason for her not wanting to go out?

Then it wasn't until new years, when we ate dinner and just as we were getting into our plates, a knock on the door called our attention to receive my uncle and aunt and cousins. Karla arrived later with her boyfriend. He's studying Medicine, does that mean he's more knowledgable about trans issues? Is that something good or bad? Do I want him to be supportive or just oblivious?

I met Edgar's girlfriend. Until now I had forgotten she's actually younger than me. He introduced me as his niece "Sofia". It was nice. She didn't hesitate nor made any face or comment. None of them called me Ivan. That name was mentioned but I can't remember by who. It doesn't really matter. There were some conflicting emotions. Catherine sent me the holiday message and then, some times later asked me if I was upset with her. I told her the truth.

What is it that I feel? I resent her for being successful. I resent her being tired about having a job and being busy and having things to do. I hate thinking how she has it "so much easier" having all her papers in order and a good paying job and yet she has the choice of staying here.

Tomorrow my uncle and aunt will come to Tijuana to pick my cousin from the airport. I am just remembering about how my mother said that if I would accompany her to pick a present for Norma it would have to be tomorrow. I asked her if she will want to go. She answered "yes".

Was it yesterday or today that Catherine and I talked about our silence? Would I really explain to her how I feel?

I told her, I am ashamed of those feelings. I hate myself for thinking that, for needing her help and resenting not having it. I understand it's not her obligation, why does it hurt me so much? Why am I so afraid?

We ate breakfast. There was an alarm that woke me in the early morning. I can't even estimate the time I fell asleep. I was so tired I took the first opportunity I could to go to the bathroom and change into my bed clothes and then set up the couch to lie down.

We visited my father's sisters. I'd be lying if I wrote here I wasn't nervous. We arrived and Martha was sitting in the porsche. I greeted her. A couple of minutes later, my other aunts arrived as well. Alma, Paty and my cousins Juan Carlos and Sebastian. Sebastian acted just like all the other children do. Juan Carlos was excited to see me and hugged me tightly. My aunt Paty said good bye, "mija".

They asked me some questions about the master and my next trip to the capital. I answer those questions with excitement and thrill. Both there and in the gathering of the office, I was told how they don't really like the city.

I know it's not the best, I know probably I won't love it.

It's not the traffic, nor the insecurity, nor the energetic way of living.

I am scared of being hated, and ending alone.

## 2017-01-02

I'm sitting in the back seat of the Mitsubishi next to my aunt. We are on the line of the border to cross to the United States. We are just to the side of the Premiere hotel.

My uncle and aunt arrived around four or five in the afternoon. I am taking my coat off. I feel ill. My stomach is delicate. I have some sort of nausea. Maybe it's the artificial heat of the car.

Catherine sent me a message in the morning. At first it was a screencap of her playing pokemon Go. She said she's been playing the app for half a year and just now encountered a squirtle but has no pokeballs.

I saw her text and felt irritated. I thought of all the times that we walked around the beach and I glanced at her phone to see the game on its screen.

"you know I love you, right?"

I remembered her question when I went to the bathroom.

"Do you want to do something tomorrow?", she asked before starting her shift.

"I don't know, let's talk about it later."

She answered a couple hours later: "but I'm asking you if you want to... Sorry... How much later?"

We talked about it in her break. I am irritated. I think about Friday and all of the emotions that have been ruminating since then. I want to cancel her just like she has. I want to not care about seeing her just as I feel she doesn't.

I asked her if we went out tomorrow, would we see each other for my birthday. She said it was part of her idea. Seeing each other tomorrow would be an opportunity to talk about what happened, and not leave it to that day.

I helped my mom with her PowerPoint presentation. She was working on it in the living room when making a mistake around two thousand blank slides were added.

We are still making the line. Catherine sent me a message asking who would go, and that we should leave my aunt because she doesn't have sentri.

"We can't just leave her, we're going to pick up her son"
"is he underage?"

I was frustrated with her inability to empathize. Yeah, he left less than a week. But she wants to see him.

I stopped the conversation again and questioned her once more about what she wanted to do tomorrow. She hasn't answered since that question two hours ago.

She saw Miguel, her friend, today. They are in Costco. She is just answering. We could go to Playas. Have I seen the episode of sense8? She saw it initiated in Netflix.

I think about answering and the same worry I shared with her. I am scared of being an asÃ­ hole towards her because of all the emotions I keep repressing.

I had told her how I thought about going to Balboa Park and eating at Å¥ guys for my birthday.

When I saw the pictures in my computer, around the beginning of the year when we left to other countries there was a going out that consisted in us going to San Diego downtown and eating there. Was it the first time we went?

I looked and was different right then.

Now it will be one of the last times I'll go to the United States again in a while. It'll be commemorating my first birthday as Sofia, oficially.

Sometimes I fantasize about the name on the cake. I've never been a fan of cakes and birthdays, and yet now I smile with the image of Sofia written with syrup on a dessert shared with family.

I was sweeping the floor when my dad came indoors with a bunch of papers. "are all of them for here?", asked him Miguel.

I didn't hear his answer but can't think of no reason why would he come with letters from other houses.

I was starting with the dinning room when he reached an envelope and said: "I think this is for you"

I grabbed it and looked at it. At first I thought it was something good from the bank of my new debit card. I don't know which I saw first, the image of the hospitals and the health theme or my name written.

It didn't fit. Who would send me a letter with my name? Who knows about it? I opened it and inside came a catalogue and two plastics with my name written as well. It's some kind of membership with a vigency of two years.

And here I am, leaving the north part of the country in one month exactly.



## 2017-01-03

Catherine and I agreed to meet up today. I worried that we would use the opportunity to talk about what has been happening lately, with both of us. Halfway in our date I lost that preoccupation. Just arriving to my home, we lasted about an hour talking, sharing and crying. I said how I've been thinking about breaking up, and then moments later actually feared that the conversation would really conclude there. I had a panic attack, sort off.

The status quo remains, for now. She confessed that the gathering they've been organizing was kind of a surprise for me. That's how the conversation started. Arriving to the neighborhood, I asked her if she really wanted to see them, to go. We stopped and she lowered the volume of the radio. And so it all began.

Yesterday I said good-bye to my uncle and aunt earlier. I went to my bed and lied down. I had done the words in the line to cross the border. Three hours we lasted. It wasn't as shorts as my parents hoped but neither as long as it could had been. We arrived just in time to the airport, even after the needed stop we had to do so my mom could go to the bathroom. I stepped down the car with my aunt and little after my mother followed us. I knew how to look. I searched for the flights on the carrousels of baggage. I found the airline in the screen above the last one and from there I scanned the faces of the people waiting. I think I saw him first. Moments later my aunt did as well. I was the one who took his suitcase. It was a little exciting and scary at the same time. Will I be doing that soon? Yes.

I am eating a bowl of soup and a flour taco of beans. The bowl is empty and there's maybe three bites left of the taco.

I'm going to the kitchen to heat the rest of the soup and another tortilla.

We stayed in the United states less time than the one it took to get there initially. Since the day before that we came back from Mexicali there was a nagging backache that was just gestating. At first it was an unpleasant sensation in my buttocks being seated on half of the seat of the car. Yesterday, maybe because of the cold or as a late manifestation of the lack of rest, it grew exponentially.

It got to the point that I went to bed early and then, an hour after, had to get up again suffocating on the pain and desperation looking for a cream or a pill or whatever that could take the pain away.

I rested and woke up fine. It was late in the morning, an hour shy of noon. We had agreed to meet around two in the afternoon, I had time to get ready. I did. Catherine ended up picking me up. I decided to wear make up, probably I won't tomorrow, even though I'll go to the municipal palace to ask for a new birth certificate. Should I go feminine? Should I tame it down to androgyny?

We went to the plaza in the Playas. I asked Catherine to wait in the car and she noticed something wrong. We window shopped around the plaza and then went to Argana. There was no sign of the waitress who knows us. In the market, the man before us asked me if I was waiting in line with the car next to me. I said no and he joked how he wondered if "the lady will get a chocolate overdose". The waitresses in Argana gendered us correctly the same way.

We watched the first half of the Sense8 christmas special. We bought a deck of cards in Dax and looked at the baggages.

We talked about this Friday, the day before my birthday. What will the plans be for then? We could go eat breakfast early in the morning and cross just after. Spend the morning in Balboa Park and finish eating at 5guys.

I remembered I have a session with a patient and sent him a message to see if I could move him. He hasn't answered back.

From Argana we went to Plaza Rio, we looked around for baggages still, we talked some more and even wandered around the toy are of Sears.

That's why she kept mentioning the gathering of the seven.

What will happen? Will she cancel it? Will we break up?

I'm accustomed to fear being now less than a month away of leaving. What is this that I'm feeling?

## 2017-01-04

"You write 700 words daily and can't redact a single letter?" "In exactly a month from now you'll be doing your exam"

I almost forgot the words again. Not even a week since I broke a 50 day long streak and I would fall again. Will I continue this habit when I leave the city?

Just now I told Jhonny about my departure. He sent me a text message, maybe it was early today, maybe it was from yesterday. "Let's go to six", he invites me. I told him the truth, I don't go to that place. It scares me. He thought I was being playful and insisted. I kept my ground and repeated myself. Just a couple of minutes ago I added this new bit of information he lacked: I don't have much time nor money. In a month I'll be going to the capital.

Yesterday that Catherine and I returned from our date, before we started talking about the ugly past and fearful future, we remembered to buy two agendas again. I want to. I liked having a way of recording the daily anecdotes and occasions. I have an attempt of one in the black book with the logo of the university. I was actually surprised that I really finished this one.

Just this evening I filled the last three days. A full year. What I can't do in this page I managed to in that beautiful notebook that Catherine and I bought a year ago together. Was it after watching The Danish Girl?

It surprises me how I dared to go outside dressed femininely even without starting hormones. I am full time. I live my life now. I am Sofia, inside and out, in my home and my job, with my friends and family and coworkers.

Why does it still feel like a far away wish? I have a prescription with my name in it and I asked Rene for his, as well.

I found really hard to get out bed today. Last night Rene sent me a message to confirm today's session at 1pm. We hadn't set a time for our session. I used the extra time for sleep. The backache returned but not with the same intensity. Several periods of sleep, the last ones, I spent them on my back with Nymeria lying on my arm. Neither of us got out until after eleven.

I dreamed with Alan. I dreamed I was in some sort of house. There was family in there, probably my grandma's home, but not really. I saw him. We talked. In the dream I asked him, no, told him Aidee had said how Monica talk about me behind my back to him.

"Yeah, I was angry with you. She made me be angry to you."

We talked, I don't remember if he told me what was exactly what were told. He looked different than how I remember him. No, the other way around. He was different than how I know he looks, he was more like how I remember him but older-looking.

When I woke up, I stayed with the doubt if Aidee had really told me that Monica poisoned my image to him. I wondered about it, trying to remember. As the day passed I let the thought go, just as I rethink it, I can see how it's not really possible. Aidee hadn't talked with anyone from the university. Monica isn't and wasn't really close to Alan. She might not be the innocent angel as I idolized her, but neither is she a harpy that hates me and wishes me ill.

I focused the rest of my thoughts to Alan. Should I reach out to him? I thought about sending him a message. Something along the lines of saying I recalled his birthday was a couple of days ago, but I was unsure of congratulating him. I don't really know how much he knows about me, or his opinion nor thoughts. It doesn't really matter. If he doesn't mind, good. If he dislikes me now, it's unfortunate but inconsequential. I dreamed about him, that my ex talked about me behind my back and it made me think. That I have no right to defend myself. I know, more like suspect, that they haven't had contact lately, and even if they did, I wouldn't be one their conversation topics.

I thought about our friendship, how he was there for me and we shared so much. I never thanked him. As the semesters pass, I let our friendship drift away. I preferred being closer to Mona and that other group of people, than being loyal to him. I don't talk anymore to neither of those people, some don't want to know nothing about me, and yet I preferred them to him.

I'm sorry and I wish him the best.

I just wanted him to know that I haven't forgotten him, and he's still in my mind.

## 2017-01-05

"Hey, Luis, or more correctly Leslie"...

I opened the blue notebook that was inside the bag I lend to them. I caught a glimpse of what was written inside before he took it from my hands. We started playing chess.

I set the alarm at the maximum I could sleep and having time to get ready and go meet my patient. Yesterday, was it? No, Tuesday I sent a message asking my patient to move our appointment to today. Yesterday, after he confirmed, I sent a message to Liliana telling her about the change and asking if the office would be occupied. She answered back just saying that please to move it to noon. Immediately I sent another message to my patient asking him about the change. There was no problem.

I had an extra hour in the morning and yet I got out of bed completely exhausted. Again the backache was still there, bugging, annoying.

"Katherine, kiss me" is the song that's playing as I return from my distraction and continue the words not even at its half. Rene was right. I write three quarters of a thousand words a day and yet, as I tried to redact the draft of the letter while my patient was answering I was in blank.

I showered and wore the first thing that I saw in my closet. It was the red sweater that looks kinda like a high school uniform as my mother told me. Under I wore the jeans looking stretch pants.

Just again as I went to the kitchen to heat some rice and beans, the pain in my back has returned. Tomorrow I'm supposed to get up early and get ready to go to the United States with Catherine. How am I supposed to do that with this handicap? I remember two years ago when we went to Guadalajara and just like this, I had this very same pain coming in the way to our trip.

I don't think I'll finish the report that I'm halfway done for. I should leave the hope of finishing the letter as well. Catherine set the time for picking me up by 8, so I should sleep as soon as possible. Maybe as soon as I finish this words and bowl of heated meal.

First we talked about going to Balboa Park, wandering around its passage and museums. Then, when thought about just going to the mall and shop around before eating. Then we returned to the plan just to cancel it again when there was predictions of rain. And now that apparently the rain won't come again until Saturday, the plan is back on track.

Just now I'm seating again after going upstairs to my parents room and get my visa and sentri card.

I saw a post in the group of the faculty that asked for girls interested in doing internship in a HR department. "Will the recruitment be done with the vaginas? Because I don't understand the need for the interns to be girls". I wrote that in the comment section knowing very well that I would not be able to send it. I took a picture and sent it to Catherine as not letting be forgotten what I thought.

She agreed that I should not post that. Instead I wrote in my Facebook something that I had thought about a long ago.

"Colleagues in HR, if you limit sex and age in your job description, you're not doing a profile, you're discriminating"

Passed a couple of minutes I thought it would go unnoticed, ignored and forgotten as time would pass. I was wrong. Kathia liked it first and then slowly the number reached like 8 or 9 people. That's enough for me.

It's something that has always frustrated me. I've experienced it myself. In seventh semester when we took the community psych class and we had to cooperate with a NGO that helped the community, the one we were assigned to, rejected us. Then we kept on the look to someone to offer our help, to give them a hand even without asking for pay. We couldn't find one. The teacher kept sending us offers and everyone turned unapproachable. Finally we were sent to the house of the Indigenous woman. Only to be greeted by saying that they were really expecting girls. The leader and head in charge didn't deny the entry to Felix or me, as I was presenting as guy still, but their actions showed her not wanting us.

I'm a recent graduate that can't really find a job. Looking for a master is just an excuse to stop the search.

I hope I get it and in the time I can change all my papers. I prefer a thousand times being rejected because of being a woman than because of being trans.

## 2017-01-06

Today is not really my birthday. Since the start of the day I had the idea that I would be celebrating it with Catherine. The plan was that she'd pick me up and we'd start the itinerary with a breakfast at pozolito before going to the United States.

I had to interrupt my writing to get up from my seat and run upstairs to the bathroom, I think this is the fourth time today that I've sat on the toilet with the intention to release my stomach uneasiness. My legs are throbbing in pain because of the walk. Right at this moment I'm feeling horrible with pain and discomfort. And yet, I remember most of this day with glee and satisfaction.

I woke up half an hour before six. Or was it a complete hour? I read Catherine's message from the end of night and wondered about getting up. It was way too early but would I have enough time to get ready? She had told me she'd pick me up at my house around 8 in the morning.

I did anticipate the alarm but ended up postponing it anyway. I got out of bed at six as it was the first plan. I showered and shaved and dressed and put on make up and got ready with extra time. She got here around eight ten. I saw the gift she had ready for me in the backseat before returning home to get my coat.

She drove to the University along the familiar drive I used to take almost daily some time ago that seems like an earlier life. Seeing the campus and the faculty again brought back all sorts of memories and emotions. Catherine proposed to go get two burritos from the place next to the bookshop. We could buy them and take them with us to The United States in our journey. We finally got to the plaza and specifically the mexican restaurant we discovered in our last semesters and fully enjoyed various times and occasions.

She parked the car giving its back to the locale. I mentioned her how my mom asks my dad to park in certain ways to avoid the sun to directly hit her seat. She asked me to grab the gift from the seat and she took some balloons and party hats from the trunk. I saw them with disbelief. Was she being serious? Did she really expect us to wore those and me to be there with that bunch of balloons?

I hesitantly walked with her. We sat at the table straight to the entrance door. I saw the silhouette of two women but paid them no attention. Subconsciously I thought how one of them resembled Anahi. And then it hit me when they stood up. The mysterious woman was Anahi, the other one was Paola. Catherine had mentioned a surprise gathering. We had all agreed to meet this Sunday so I had forgotten all about that. It hit me totally by surprise. I saw the tables and the number of chairs and still thought it would be just the four of us.

Catherine told me then that Chevo and Jessica were on their way.

We all had breakfast together and chatted and had a nice time. Paola brought some Kings' bread and we cut it as if it were a cake. They sang me the Happy Birthday song and in my good mood I misheard them gendering me correctly. They did say my name, though, that was enough to make me smile stupidly for the pictures.

We all said our good-byes, took some more pictures and then left. Catherine and I went straight to the border and we crossed it. I made the first stop in the bathroom in those offices.

We went directly to Downtown and took the bus to arrive to Balboa Park. We watched the dogs and saw some museum and walked around the botany garden and Alcazar garden and one with statues. We took lots and lots of pictures and had so much fun I forgot lots of times about the next trip and my dysphoria and my fears.

We ate at 5 Guys and I made the second bathroom stop. The burger tasted like glory and we talked some about our pasts birthdays. We made a stop at Horton Plaza where we wandered a little and she bought some tennis shoes. From there it was all a trip home.

Tomorrow maybe I won't see her. This time is turn to celebrate my official first birthday with my family.

## 2017-01-07

"24th, shouldn't it be 1?"

I didn't understand her at first. One? Why one. What could one mean? My first year as Sofia. Last year I already knew. So did she. Maybe it was because of that. I loved the pictures. I can totally notice the difference between past birthdays and my forced smiles. I was actually excited blowing the candles and seeing the sparks from the little thingy.

This is really my birthday.

Shrek is playing in the living room. We're all sitting together watching it. Both of my parents and my brothers and even grandma. The movie was playing in Dish but it was only in english. I was the one with the idea of searching for it in Netflix. And that's why and how we are all here.

Last night I finished the words and went straight to bed. Every word left was excruciating. I finished and as soon as I set the folder that I shared with them I hid under the covers as if being in my bed would do something about the pain. It didn't. I tried moving the legs and leaving them still. The pain was still there growing. It was excruciating and unforgiving.

Time passed. I knew the pain would fade away as I slept but reaching sleep was impossible with the pain. I really don't know the time I actually fell asleep but it probably wasn't earlier than two in the morning. I put on long socks and then changed my t-shirt to something more warm and finally I put the bottom of my pants inside the socks.

I can't remember what I dreamed. I know it was a lot. I didn't get up from the bed until after noon. Some minutes after one.

I went out of my room. I was really tired but the pain was gone. The first one to congratulate me was Luis. He extended his arms to hug me. Then my grandma remembered after giving me my plate and hugged me strongly. All of them hugged me and wished me the best. Miguel and my father, even. He extended his hand but I ignored it and hugged him instead. He didn't use any name.

I opened facebook not knowing what to expect. I knew there would be some people congratulating me. I know there won't be all of them, I don't expect either the number to be big.

Yesterday I celebrated with both my girlfriend and closest friends.

When I saw Jessica's post with the pictures and the video of them singing the Birthday song and stumbling with the gendered letter made me insecure. I checked some of the pictures and looked at all of the masculine features that betray me. I shared it with Catherine and told her how I did not really wanted to see the pictures of us. I knew I had liked some of them and seeing them with those eyes would really hurt me.

Today there were some pictures, too. I wore the blouse I put on Christmas but skipped the black cardigan that hide the uncovered shoulders. I liked most of the pictures. I told my parents to go to Hornero, that place I had visited with Catherine.

My father left in the morning to put gasoline in the other side of the border because of all that's been going one with the prize of the gasoline and the manifestations and the scarce because of them.

The movie is finished and everyone is standing up and getting ready. All going to continue their life.

We ordered pizza and spaghetti and salad. The pizzas were of chicken and chipotle and the other mexican. The spaghetti was with italian sausage and the salads were caesar's and cilantro.

Someone from the other table helped taking a picture from us. The food was amazing and the time we spent as well. We stopped by the bakery to buy a cake. We got here after maybe an hour from all the stops and waiting. I exchanged messages with Catherine after eating the cake and taking some pictures. Here they sang the tune correctly. The sparkling candle was sprinkling and there was a silence that broke with my grandma's singing.

Nymeria was nimbling something and my mother asked me to see. We're watching now the movie "Eight basque last names", with my mom and grandma after finishing Shrek. It's nice remembering the accents and those familiar voices as when I was there.

Johanna sent me a message saying how I looked really happy and Consuela was the first one to congratulate me on Facebook.

## 2017-01-08

I almost forgot to do the words again. I came back from the restroom after feeling an urgent need of going to the restroom. Luis was in the restroom we usually occupy so I went straight to my parents'. My mother is downstairs doing something on her tablet. I had just went outside to see the last episode of Sherlock as some kind of rest from redacting the evaluation report. I just need to finish the conclusion and print it. If I had finished it, I guess I would had come to bed instead to rest. I had totally forgot about the words.

Yesterday was my birthday. It's a little sad. I remember half a year ago when I came out publicly on Facebook and didn't care about the number of people that added me as a gesture of acceptance. Now I do think about the ones that I can recall not wishing me a happy birthday. I see Omar's and Diana's updates and think how they are way closer to my ex. I guess, because I don't really see what she does or publishes.

I told Catherine how I had thought about sending something to M's father. He was the first person I knew that shared a birthday with me. It was fun to have a mutual congratulations. I wrote a simple but heartfelt note lying to him saying that I had no ill feelings towards her daughter. Why do I really want to contact him? What is the real reason I had the urge of him knowing or facing my transition? Catherine is right mentioning how it would be the same feeling I have when knowing that my mom is still in some sort connected to my ex. I have no reason to communicate with him after the breaking of contact with M.

I type her initial as some sort of euphemism of her name. Why am I avoiding it? Do I expect me to eventually forget it?

I woke up late but not as late as other days before. Nymeria was by my side in bed. I can't recall if I dreamed or if it were a dark boring night. This time there were no pain or ill-thoughts that bothered my sleep. It was a clean dive to the sea of slumber.

How many days have I written in english since the first time that I had the idea of using this second language as a way of avoiding censure and over-thought and to use this habit as a way of strengthening my english fluency? Is it a year? More?

A year from yesterday I went out with Catherine in a rainy morning to eat breakfast before my session with Rene. It was one of the first times that I went out in a feminine attire. My lips were red and I think I wore these pants. My sweater was for men but I felt exposed. I see the pictures and see so much difference and yet I still think other times that I haven't changed at all.

She gave me a dvd of Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. The wrapping of the box was of newspaper, specifically the ads section. I noticed my name was in one of them and I point towards it in the picture she took. In the video that the camera records appears how I notice a second box that advertises a transexual prostitute. It was a weird king of laugh. Catherine was mortified and her apologizing shame made it alright.

We went to a motel, a fancy one, where we took our clothes off and enjoyed our bodies. It was after feeling feminine even without clothes, after freeing both loved and free, that I found the courage to call again to the endocrinologist and set the appointment stating my intention of starting medical transition. Three and a half months later I took my first dose and a year from that first day was sitting with my family behind me wearing nothing but female clothes and hearing them singing the birthday song with my real name.

I set the appointment to deliver the results of the evaluation for tomorrow afternoon. Again I kept postponing the scanning and writing of the letter. I asked my mom to go to Costco to buy the pills. The didn't have them. I asked my dad to stop at the other pharmacy near home, but instead of paying 20 or 30 pesos for every box, it was 87, 200 and 300 instead.

My mom gave me a bill of 500 to pay for them and even then I felt the cost hit my wallet. I have more money than ever.

I posted again the ad for the course that I would give this saturday. There is still 5 days left before its beginning for people to inscribe. Will I actually give it? Will a single person pay me?

Sometimes no matter how useful or skillful I think I am, I can't help to feel like a useless and dependent person incapable of sustaining myself.

## 2017-01-09

I'm home. As I opened the door Nymeria ran from the door of my room to receive me at the entrance with hops of thrill and enjoyment in her eyes. I see her now as she's wandering around my seat. I can't help but think about the last day before my departure. How will she take it? Will she know? How will I?

Yesterday was when we had planned to gather to cut a King's bread like the day before of my birthday. Paola cancelled at the last minute. Catherine and I had decided to skip yesterday and just go today instead. I went but she did not.

There was some issues with my patient and the delivery of her results. I was annoyed by Lili's attitude towards it, saying it was a must that the three of us were together. I can't see other reason than it being because of the money. It all was set to this morning. We agreed to meet at noon today. It wasn't as late as her appointment with Lili but it was early enough to agree with her schedule of work. I finished the evaluation last night after returning from deciding against seeing the latest episode of Sherlock.

This morning I received a call. That arabic song surprises me every time that it plays. It was her. It would be hard for her to attend today's session. Because of the rain they took her car and it was ugly where she lives because there isn't any pavement. Apparently it was raining. I hadn't realized. I told her it was alright. As soon as we hung up, I sent a message to Lili. We agreed for tomorrow at noon. Everything was set. I went back to sleep and didn't get up until two hours after noon.

I know I dreamed something. I have this sense of an alternate reality. A sort of return from a different scenery and experience. I can't recall what it was about.

My grandma prepared breakfast as if it wear a lunch and I ate it besides Miguel. A little after, in fact as soon as we finished, she sat at the empty table and finished her meal.

Today was set for going to drink a cup of something and see a movie. Maybe passengers with Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, maybe the reencarnation, some sort of scary movie, or maybe something else. I sat at my desk with the intention of writing and finishing the motive letter. I did start it and I did advance, but I did not finish. I made a draft but discarded it. I hesitated without knowing if I should write my name in there or made a mention of me being transgender.

When I told Catherine she found it hard to see why would I put it in. What does it have to do my gender identity with my intentions of studying a master in neurobiology. It's more about introducing myself. The motives letter is the first way of letting them know about me. How can I present myself without letting them know the most important thing about my identity? How can I put another name that not represents me?

I let it pass and just wrote.

I have maybe half, maybe just the introduction. I decided against just listing my experiences and what I've done. Maybe tomorrow that Catherine comes with me, and before picking up Luis for the movie I could finish it.

In a moment when I needed a rest from thinking about the letter I entered again into the site of rents and looking for roommates. It was stressing and like a slap to the face about the imminent reality I'm about to step into.

I agreed to go see them but told myself I would probably not enter to the movie and just spend some time with them until the movie would begin. I drove there using some of the last eight of gas in the tank. When I arrived Paola and Chevo told me they were thinking about going to Carrousel Plaza instead, the movie would being in 20 minutes.

At first it was a little upsetting realizing that my trip would end up being for naught. They asked me why didn't I want to go. There was a promotion and Paola would drive me from there and back. I thought how I told Catherine: "If I don't go today, I don't know when I will see them next"

I agreed.

## 2017-01-11

I cheated yesterday. Why?

What was I doing or what kept me busy? I saw Catherine yesterday. That's right.

Firstly I woke up and got ready to see my patient at noon. I wore... It wasn't really feminine but it wasn't male clothes either. I wore the dark red hoodie. Did It rain? I took a uber ride to the office. I got there first before Lili and my patient. I took the laptop with me. I had the intention of finishing redacting the motive letter. The office was closed so instead I waited outside with my phone and the internet. My patient arrived and we chatted for a while. I asked her if she entered to classes yet. I knew she was studying two careers. I waited for her answer explaining me that she had already finished in UABC and then I clarified that I was talking about Law.

We talked a little about how it has been and she mentioned an issue with her professor. That talk led us to the issues there are even with psych professors. I let it pass and just heard what she had to say. It got to a point that I could not resist. "Who?" I asked non-chalantly.

"Vinicio"

Liliana arrived a couple of minutes after noon and said how she has to work with her lack of punctuality. We sat and the session began. I gave and explained the results and my findings. I concluded and gave the paper to Lili to sign it. It was alright. They congratulated me again for my job. She told me how even before beginning Lili said only good things about my work. The hour passed really fast. We both would wait. The patient for her session with Lili two hours later and I for Catherine to arrive.

Lili asked me if she would see me later. I told her that probably not. I would just wait "for my uber"... "Catherine?" she understood my joke and laughed. She entered with her patient and I sat in the waiting room with the macbook on my lap and continued redacting the letter. Not much later Catherine sent me a message saying how she was around the corner. I put my things in the bag and went downstairs.

In her car she drove us to Plaza Rio. We would not eat yet. We instead sat in Dinasty12, order two cups of tea and started browsing the hotels for our stay in Mexico.

An hour and a half later we went to Luis school to pick him up. We arrived and there were two people standing in the door of the building next to the one that used to be the kindergarten where I went. Now it is the middle school that L attends. I stepped down the car when I saw the principal step outside with them. I saw their mouths move as if she gave notice of something. When I approached them to ask if the kids were still in there, they told me that they had already called my sibling.

Had they known I would pick him up? Do they know me? They know L situation and that means they probably know about their trans sibling, which I am.

We went to Plaza Rio. They ordered Ramen and I, a Lebanese hot dog. We sat the Assassin's Creed movie in 4d. It was really fun, all of us enjoyed it. She drove us home, but did not stay as we had talked about.

When I got into my desk, instead of keeping looking for hotels I told her I should instead be browsing apartments. And then I realized I had to finish the letter. Signing it was way harder than I thought. Putting my legal name felt fake and the real one felt imposing.

I finished and went straight to bed.

No. I'm lying. When I got home I asked my parents if they knew of any open gas stations. As Catherine brought us, we were on the lookout for the closest stations. She kept the lookout on her way home. My parent told me that the nearest one beside the London Bridge, the one we could not see because of the underpass, was open. "And there isn' any line, either". I grabbed my keys and went. It was closed. Instead I kept looking until I found one that was just opening. I paid 400 pesos of gas.

Today I had a session. I had forgotten about it. Miguel had asked me if I could take him to school. I told him I had no gas, but since I put some yesterday I took him today in the morning. From there I returned to get ready and leave for my second to last therapy. Or is there another one?

The lady from the dental office started talking to me, saying I couldn't be there. It was private and they paid for using them. I didn't understand her at first but she was just talking. Suddenly I just said. "I didn't park there" "Who did, then?" "I don't know... I came walking". She just apologized and left. After my session I went to Catherine's. We kept looking for hotels and I uploaded the documents I scanned in the morning.

The reservation is done and my application is set.

We watched together Sausage Party in her bed. We touched each other under her cover. After the movie she gave me the second part of her gift. It was a Wreck this Journal like the one I gave her before our departure and a photo album with pictures of my first year as Sofia. I wanted to hug her and kiss her all over, again and again.

I don't know how much I'll miss her. Neither the album nor the thousands pictures I have will help me with her absence.

## 2017-01-12

Thursday now is ending. Another week almost passes. This next Monday will be the start of the second half of the month. Exactly three weeks are left until my departure. The day after tomorrow was supposed to be the day of my workshop. It has sense, thinking about it now, that nobody gave me money for it. People who don't know me are not really probable to just deposit money to a stranger without even an address of office. I decided against collaborating with Lili because of a possible lose of money. I would had given her half of my earnings, I figured. But what I didn't realize was that I would be gaining a source of trust, a contact who could propagate the information to countless patients students of psychology. I could back myself up with the name of the office. Even losing half of the earnings, had she given me just one or two patients, I would be having more than nothing.

Tomorrow I have to talk with Paola. What are we going to do? She reserved the place. 200 pesos had to be paid as deposit. Will I give her the course? Will I pay her?

It's uncomfortable just thinking about her. I confessed to Catherine how I came to feeling that organizing it was a bad idea. Now I just feel worse about my situation. Not only am I unhirable, apparently I'm unable to even get clients myself.

It was all Paola's idea, she pressured me to do it, convinced me. Even after the first time that I had to cancel the improvised one, that would had been augure enough.

I had to interrupt my writing because of Nymeria. She was just here doing her usual troubles nibbling the box spring under my mattress when I held her down and reprimanded her. Without intention I ran over her paw with the wheel of the office chair. A sharp cry of pain came from her. She ran away. She was clean. When she returned from outside the room I noticed red spots. She had climbed the bed. At first I thought it was like when I tried cutting her nails. I might had injured her with the chair, maybe the blood came afterwards instead of instantly. I took her down of the bed before it looked like a crime scene. Her paws were clean. The blood was on her head and both ears, and spots were on her back as well, marking the white robe my grandma put on her. I went to the kitchen and wet a kitchen towel to clean her up.

Moments ago I went to the bathroom and after exiting, instead of returning I went to L's room to play videogames. My grandma shortly after came to the room as well to lie down. We heard her scream. "Somebody must have stepped on her", I disregarded it. When I saw the blood I thought of that. Maybe the injury was from there. I ran upstairs to ask Miguel or my grandma. Miguel was in the bathroom. While I was upstairs she cried again. It was a cry of pain, like a stab or a bite. I ran down. Maybe she did it to herself again with something. She was just waiting before the fence.

I kept cleaning her but nothing appeared. She's clean now, lying on her bed. I don't really now what happened. Probably she cut her ear with one of the springs from the bed.

Tomorrow I'll see my patient. I should go to order my birth certificates. Not tomorrow, but soon. Maybe next week. Will I have problems with that? Should I try to go as neutral as possible? I don't know how much it will cost me.

The reservation of the hotel is set and ready. Now it's just matter of paying Catherine. I could exchange half of the 4k pesos my mom gave me and use the other half to pay her. The trip is paid as well. All is set until our departure. Three weeks. Three weekends. 21 nights in my bed, with Nymeria, with my family, with a home.

I'll see Rene probably two or three more times. I'll see once my patient before giving him the results. Next monday was set the meeting with the psychologist who leaders the Association of Trans care.

In her email she talked about empowering trans women with a workshop or something like that. Catherine was the one who mentioned the absence of trans men. The only other trans person I've known personally is a trans man. I have read about and understand the evidence behind negating the idea that there are more trans women than men.

Is it as uncomfortable the exclusion now that I am in?



## 2017-01-13

I saw my patient today. I thought it would be the last session of tests applications, but I was wrong. I will see him again before the last one.

Yesterday, had I finished my words already? I think I put in the last section how Nymeria was bathed in blood. I reprimanded her and accidentally ran over her paw. Later, when she returned she had her head all spotted in red dots of blood. I was scared. I still don't really know how it happened.

I went upstairs to call Miguel, maybe he had seen something. My grandma came downstairs to see what happened. Miguel was in the bathroom but as soon as he got out he came as well. Even my mother, an hour later that the both of us were already in bed, opened the door and asked me.

I heard through the door how my grandma told her the story. My mother ended up believing that I ran over her ear instead of her paw. I was angry because of that suspicion. Maybe it's because I'm not really convinced that didn't happen.

At night, when it was time to go to bed, she was agitated and conscious about her surroundings. She was extra aware, as if she felt in danger. I looked at her and it scared me. She couldn't stay in one place. At first she would walk to the corner of the door and looked around as if she heard or saw something. Then she would walk to the other part of the room, next to my desk where all of her toys are. I went to bed thinking that eventually she would follow me and climb to my side. I was wrong. Time passed and she stay there, or swapped places between the two extremes of the room. I would turn the light on as minutes pass to check on her and she would keep looking around waiting for something.

I grabbed her and took her to bed with me. She was panting and breathing so fast. Her ear was still moist with the red liquid. I held her close to my chest trying to calm her down. She would for a while but then her respiration would accelerate to that frightening state. Minutes turned to hours. It was around two in the morning and she was still doing it. I had her under the sheets by my side, it was cold. I was cold.

I don't know the exact time either of us fell asleep. Maybe I dreamed something but I would not really remember. I have snaps of other dreams, fragments of lives and worlds that are not these.

I had my alarm at eight and nine. Today I would meet Lucas in the office at noon. I heard the voice of my grandma and my mother before her departure to work. She doesn't take L anymore. Grandma made her breakfast, it was on the table. I heard how she said that she prepared eggs for me. I didn't get up. Was Nymeria asleep?

The alarm sounded and I turned it off. I had an hour left for sleep. Then the alarm sounded again. I got out of bed and ate. The eggs were in the pan covered by a white plate. There was another pan with beans in it. I took two tortillas from the fridge and heated them. Did I make myself a taco or did I use the tortilla as a spoon?

I swallowed my pills with the leftover juice in the blue jar. I've been gaining weight. It doesn't matter how much I think about controlling what I eat, I can't seem to stop.

I showered and got ready. Miguel didn't get out of his room until the afternoon. I got to the office and it was open. I waited my patient, he was a couple of minutes late. The test was halfway done when I told him he could leave.

I took the wrong exit to my home. I had to return and do almost the double of the normal trip.

I sent a message to Paola asking her if I would have to return her the deposit of the hall or maybe I could go and give her the material. I had just told Catherine how I dreaded that conversation.

Apparently she didn't even booked it. She wanted to wait until the first client.

It's cancelled, I guess...

Lili didn't mention anything about going out. I didn't either. Tomorrow we might go to the united States. I wish. Even if we don't, I'll go with Catherine this Sunday.

## 2017-01-14

I knew today we would go to the United States. Yesterday my dad confirmed it when my grandma and L arrived from school. I set the alarm to get up early in the morning. Because of not having a sentri card anymore, we would all be having to do the normal line. So before sleeping I set the alarm to eight and a half and nine.

I can't remember if I dreamed something. I feel like I did. Something about my cousins or being in Mexicali. I don't really now. Nymeria declined sleeping with me in the bed. It was a lonely night. I didn't get up from the first alarm. I don't know if it was then that I heard the sound of my father in the living room. At nine, the second alarm, I did get up. My father was changed and ready watching television. I asked if somebody was in the bathroom and he answered instinctively. Miguel was showering. Luis was still in bed under his covers and my grandma was in her bed as well but awake. I came downstairs again to wait. Father was watching the daily show recorded from yesterday. As I stepped out from my room he paused it and rewinded it so I could hear the joke he was laughing about.

I went upstairs half of the way several times to check the status on the bathroom. Finally when I went upstairs Miguel was out of the bathroom but it was still busy. Now my mother was the one who was giving it use. I had to wait again a couple of minutes. My clothes stayed on the stairs with the towel over them.

Finally I showered and got ready. I shaved my chest knowingly that I would be wearing a long necked purple blouse. I tamed my hair and even wore make up. When I came down Luis was eating scrambled eggs at the table. Since he was eating I thought I could eat something as well and skip the breakfast stop. I acceded when my grandma offered me a taco of chorizo and eggs. "Just one, of corn". It was ready before I was.

My mother ate as well, we left the house around an hour before noon. I had given my mom my visa.

We crossed the border by Otay's crossing. It was short indeed. There wasn't more than 40 cars ahead of us. Mostly we lasted maybe a half an hour.

The border officer reviewed the cards, he passed my parents and stayed on mine after passing my brother's. I noticed and just raised my hand shyly. Probably she know what was happening. I had make up on and a subtle, but still noticeable red tint on my lips. She asked my mother's name and then my father and just made some jokes about where would we be going and the shopping.

We went to a money exchange booth. I went with my dad. There was a long line to the 8 windows. Just getting in, in front of the entrance was a sign stating that windows 9 and 10 were express for cash only and less than a thousand dollars. He stepped in and made the exchange. When we went out, the young woman who would use it, asked my father if he was going there, he said no. "Because there is a line"... "But they're express..." "The line is for all the windows".

He said nothing and we just left. I felt awkward for a long time and my dad really didn't seem to care.

We stopped in the mail to get my packages. I have the razorblades, my cable and adapters, the earphones and the pill container keychains.

We went to Las Americas first to buy my shoes. I didn't find the japanese ones I wanted, nor any shoe in Adidas. I bought a pair in Nike. Funnily it costed 75 dollars, just as I had told Catherine.

We bought some clothes in Old Navy, mostly me and my mom. L bought a hoodie just like my mom's.

From there we ate at 5 Guys. The postcard that I posted was still there. The one Catherine put with both of our names wasn't.

We went to Target, I bought a set of baggages. I looked at the agendas but could not find anything. What else did I buy?

In the first shop in Las Americas, as I was browsing, I noted the shop owner talking to my parents. As I went closer he said "and the young man..." I looked at him directly and he corrected himself " or... miss".

The cashier and 5Guys, after taking my order, addressed me as ma'am.

The lady in Old Navy, after asking for a fitting room, gave me the closest one to her and didn't gender me.

Catherine told me that is this weekend when his father is in Las Vegas. We cancelled our going out tomorrow. Maybe Tuesday we'll go to the United States or see Sherlock.



## 2017-01-15

I'm lying down on the couch writing the words in my phone. Nymeria is lying on my crotch and stomach, biting and nibbling her green rope toy.

I dreamed something this morning. This time I do remember. Again instead of having my current girlfriend in there sharing this fantastic reality of foreign circumstances, I had the visit of the phantom of a past relationship.

Nymi went down and ran away. I already closed the door because she had the marvelous idea of bitting her mat of pee.

Another of her latest activities is taking the rug from the edge of the first step of stairs.

In my dream I was in a home somewhere. This time it wasn't Mexicali. It was our house but it seemed different. It had this kind of "new" atmosphere. There were various animals, too. Nymeria, another dog and Pucca, the black cat of my uncle.

Was it some kind of reunion? I felt bad. Depressed. I wasn't in the mood for talking or relating to others. For some reason M was in there. We were nothing. Was it weird that she were there? How did others treat her?

She asked me if I wanted to talk or go somewhere. I, somehow, agreed. I don't remember the trip to our destination. It was some restaurant. In the table we're sitting three people, she, I, and her current boyfriend. Was he in the house as well?

The waitress came to take our order. I asked for just a glass of water. For some reason M stood up and went somewhere. Her boyfriend went behind her and I called for him, except I couldn't remember his name. Finally "Luis" flew from my mouth and he caught it. I extended the keys of my car and told him. "this was a bad idea, take her home, use my car"

I went outside and met some stranger that was smoking.

"Could I take one of those?"

He agreed to share one.

I smoked, waiting for her to come out and asked me what the Fuck was my problem, if I smoke now, why would agree to go out I would just bail, how would I return home?

I started smoking.

There was no sign of either of them. I kept smoking, relaxing. Paolas and Chevica arrived instead.

Through my mind passed the thought that there couldn't be a fittest moment for real friendship to come and give support.

Somehow an old teacher came and recognized the group. I can still kind of see her but I don't know who she is nor where I met her.

In the dream she recognized all but me. I confronted the situation and told her playfully. "I've changed a little since the last time we met... Can you notice the changes?"

I don't remember anything more.

I came out of my room to eat when my father arrived with the breakfast. One biscuit and two tacos.

I continued watching the A series of unfortunate events. Miguel has been talking to me more lately. Is he trying to be closer?

Right now nymi has gotten down again to go to him waiting for him to drop something or give her food.

He caresses her. He likes her more now.

In the television is the Harold and Kumar movie. The one where they get caught over a misunderstanding and sent to GuantÃ¡namo Bay.

I remember the first time I caught this on the television. Was I living here or in the other house in Otay?

I felt really uncomfortable in the scene where one of the protagonists masturbates and his shot of cum splashes his face.

Then, in the prison they're forced to suck a soldier's dick. Again it was unsettling.

Finally when they escape and get to a party in Miami where all of the girls are bottomless I changed the channel.

Tomorrow I'll meet with the psychologist that Melissa gave my contact information to. They and Anna, her friend, and another colleague.

We'll meet in a coffee shop in River Plaza. I could wear one for the blouses that I bought yesterday.

A couple of moments ago I painted my nails. Three of them already know I'm trans. Two of them have known me mostly as a man. Why would I care to show myself feminine?

I tried repairing the ipod nano. I disassembled it and looked for the missing "nipple" as one of the videos called it.

I ruined it. When I took the screen of, I ruptures the cable. Finally, after trying to paste countless things to the switch, I broke it.

I didn't used it, anyway. It's not a big lose.





## 2017-01-16

I'm home. I feel as if I hadn't done yesterday's words. The little boxes are checked all until today's. I haven't missed. Supposedly tomorrow I'll cross the border with Catherine. Either today or yesterday she went to Ross and bought three blouses really cheap. She showed me the images through Whatsapp. I told her that I wanted to go, too. "Today I browse the blouses, with you I'll browse the dresses."

We haven't set the details, but I don't worry much about cancellation.

These are just the only plans I have of the week. Today's, tomorrow and Friday's. Oh, right, Thursday's, too. I should go to the Municipal Palace to do the process of the birth certificates. I really don't know the time it will take to get them, nor the obstacles I might go through.

Even now as I'm typing, I know what I'm going to write about, but I feel like getting distracted. I have this urge to pause the typing and get up from my chair, go to the kitchen and see what they are talking about, what are they thinking?

Miguel is sitting on the couch watching the last episode of Sherlock. I haven't watched any but the first one. I told Catherine I wanted to see them with her. The series I am almost done with, on the other hand, is A Series of Unfortunate Events. It hit me like a truck when the parents on the show finally meet with their children and they are not the Baudelaires. They tell you from the very beginning of the show, even the theme song's chorus repeats it every episode, this is not a happy show. This won't have a happy ending.

It makes me think about 500 days of Summer, and its very beginning that warns you that it isn't a boy love girls story.

I think about that movie and how I liked it. He was a writer and I identified with him. I liked the cinematography and writing. I loved the scene of the juxtaposition of both expectations and reality. I recommended it to M, when we were still a couple. She hated it. At first I suspected it might be because of an identification with the character Summer.

Those first viewings I hated her. I saw her as the antagonist, the evil one, the one who did the wrong. Later I saw it the other way around. Until not long ago, Catherine told me that I was in Summer's place. And she's right. I behaved just like her. I treated Catherine as she treated the protagonist. I told her since the very beginning that I didn't want anything serious. That I wasn't looking for a relationship and kept my distance.

I didn't see it.

I had the meeting with Paola, the psychologist that works with the Transgender Association. I met her and saw again Ana and Melissa. "Since she arrived I saw her as Sofia, she's Sofia". Melissa mentioned the old name and it stung. Not really hurt me, more like a distasteful pinprick.

We talked about the project, or projects. In the short term they're looking and trying to plan an educational program of empowerment to Trans Women. We will collaborate with the design of the curriculum and the looking of bibliography. The second project is a kind of demographic study about the Trans population here.

The talking wasn't just about social programs, it was about research, about field work, making project proposals and designing protocols, looking for funds in the UCLA and the William's Institute. It was amazing, motivational, just wonderful.

I told just little to Catherine wanting to wait until tomorrow to tell her everything.

"It wasn't really like 'I wish I could stay so I can continue with this program', but yeah, a little"

The way there was really stressing. I left 45 minutes before the meeting time. I took the 5&10 thinking I could just take the freeway and arrive shortly. The traffic stopped me even before the under-bridge. I re-routed through the Ermita street but hit a stop at the Aguacaliente Blvd. From there the stoplights were eternal. It wasn't that I caught all the red ones, but even the greens were immobile. The worst was arriving to Paseo de los Heroes, the roundabout just before the Plaza and waiting two 5 minute red lights, with a minute green light inbetween.

I used the claxon when the red light kept shinning and when the green changed, I used it even more.

I got there half an hour after the meeting time. We will meet two days before my departure. Three...

Paola offered me to introduce me to Ruby, the leader of the organization, and said they have lots of contacts with whom I can stay there.

I'm doing it. I am really doing it. My life is taking form.



## 2017-01-17

L is resting their head on the side of my grandma's bed. When I climbed the stairs to enter the restroom, I saw them with their head on Grannie's stomach. She whispered something to them while caressing their head. Something about happiness. In the messages that I have with Catherine is one where I tell her that They seem weird. He came down with a sad and burdened face. Their headphones seemed to hide them from reality and its cruelty. I moved my head up as if asking what was wrong. He just shook it dismissively.

I have a new purse. It's a dark red almost looking like purple. "It's burgundy", is what Catherine said when I said out loud my thoughts about its color. It's small and has a zipper to guard its contents. I can't help but think about L wishes of having one. They want one way more than I ever did.

Yesterday we agreed to going to the United States. The plan stayed as going shopping, looking around for an agenda and eating at chip0tle.

Honestly, after Catherine fell asleep last night without agreeing on the terms of today, I thought the date would be cancelled. She said she's been feeling ill lately. The bottle with water spilt inside her backpack and wetted her work shirt. She blames that as the cause of her flu symptoms.

But she didn't really fall asleep. After some minutes she returned and the plans were set. She'd pick me up around 10 in the morning. We'd go. We could go to Ross and see some clothes.

I fell asleep. I dreamed something, I guess. I feel as if I did.

I haven't cleaned my face from the make up. I woke up before my mother's departure in the morning. I took Nymeria outside like those old times. I should see the date of the supposed appointment with the vet. 25th of January. We are at the 17th. More than half of the month has passed by. Less than half a month do I have left until my first test and barely more than one until the second that I don't even know the majority of its contents.

Catherine said that Nymeria's habit of biting the bed, the stairs and lately the walls, might be because of anxiety. It's true. I haven't taken her outside lately. She gave me the advice of taking her for a walk. Now, as I'm writing this paragraph, I'm holding her between my arms on my lap. She's barking now. Maybe she wants off. I put her down.

These last few nights she's been sleeping on her bed. I keep inviting her to mine, but she prefers her own.

Why do I feel to blame about L's sorrows?

I wore the new pants I bought this last Sunday with my family at the Old Navy. The morning was cold. I had the plan of wearing the gray new blouse with Catherine, the new shoes and the old pants I bought with her when we went to Chula Vista Center, and specifically Hot Topic. They were some of the last male garments that I bought. I even remember the disappointment I felt when I realized I had paid 30 dollars for a pair of pants that I well could had bought with my parents.

It was a nice surprise noticing how it was way harder to put them on, and not because of the thickness of my stomach.

I showered and shaved and got ready. Catherine arrived just at the time she said she would. We crossed the border around noon. The line wasn't long but it took its time. Little after we entered the building, I decided to stay at the right lane. When we approached the officers' booths, I noticed the woman who would attend us was taking her time and asking her questions. She held the cards and examined the pictures profusely. What would she say to me? This is not the first time that I am in this situation. Both my jeans and my hoodie were masculine. Even though there was no reason to be worried, I was relieved when the other office of the sentri booth called me.

We took the trolley and went down on Palomar. First we entered Office Depot but found nothing. They were expensive and not really noteworthy. Then it was Ross. Catherine had seen one and wondered about buying it to me. We found it but she was right, it was way too feminine for me.

Micheal's was next. There we both fell in love with the options and their discounted prices. Still, we decided to wait. Finally, in Target, we bought the cheapest ones we'd seen all day. We are both real happy with our purchases. Mine is a colored stripped notebook and hers has all this different patterns to be colored.

We both bought a blouse and I the purse I wrote about earlier. We ate at In N out. I convinced her to buy two burgers each. Maybe that wasn't such a good idea.

We crossed the border back and went to River Plaza. Dax and then the movies. She bought herself "tostilocos".

Before coming home, we stopped at a car wash.

Catherine and Anahi are talking about reuniting, going out. Maybe this Friday. Next's will be the departure party with the gang. Days keep getting busier.

I have a planner now to write everything and take them out of my mind and relax.

## 2017-01-18

"The days keep passing by faster than ever..." "Well, next one will be the last one won't it?"

Luis is right by my side. Sitting on the bed, he has the DSM 5 on his lap, and has opened it and browsed it. I glance at the page and see he's on the notes about Gender Dysphoria, the Differential Diagnoses.

There are two next weeks and I'll be leaving home. The openness of the one-way trip is a little disconcerting. I feel as if I'm wandering off to the edge of the world. I've seen already that it's not impossible. I have lots of options and opportunities. Rene reaffirmed it this session.

I will see him one or two more times. I've seen him for more than three years.

I woke up early from some terrible dreams. In the first one and only that I remember I re-experienced the disheartening horror of dysphoria as I haven't lived in a long time.

In the dream I'm talking to someone on the laptop. I know in some part of the dream I was actually playing videogames. It is some kind of reunion in a house. Here are different families and people. I've seen my friends and relatives. Anyway, I'm on the laptop with someone on my side video-chatting with someone else. In the screen I can see myself smiling cheek to cheek until I catch my glimpse. The smile vanishes as the the light after blowing on a candle. I don't like how I look. I seem weird and foreign. Is this really me? My face looks almost the same, but a little narrower and boxy. My hair is short, like when I attended high school.

I step out. Some things happen, but I can't recall any of them.

I'm outside in some kind of terrace. Catherine is next to me and Jessica in front. She looks different than how she really is. There is something with her teeth. Now she wears braces. In the dream she has no teeth but a single long one. I guess we're talking about how I feel, because she offers: "Why don't you just learn to care about yourself?"

I experience the known feeling about being in-comprehended. It's so sickening that it makes me turn and throw up over the fence. I faint.

The others are long forgotten.

I took Nymeria outside I think. We returned and went back to bed. After inviting her she did climb up and lied besides me. I hugged her close and we both fell asleep. It was almost noon when I finally answered back the messages in my phone. I talked with Catherine, telling her that I was exhausted. I wanted a day of leisure.

She asked me if I wouldn't be going out. I though about our meeting, she was referring about Rene. "It's tomorrow, isn't it? Fuck, it's today." I didn't have to review the messages from two weeks ago to confirm my fear. The same thing happened last week. I was convinced the session wasn't until Thursday.

The clock had two minutes left until reaching the highest point with both of its arms. I got up and looked at myself in the mirror. I didn't think that I looked that bad. My beard was barely noticeably and my hair wasn't totally a mess. It could be done.

I had sent a message to Catherine wondering if I could just send a message to Rene telling him that I wouldn't be able to attend. She mentioned how this would be one of the last sessions. I sent her a picture of my face asking her if it was blatantly obvious that I had just woken up. "Yeah", she told back.

I put on the burgundy jeans and the long-sleeved blouse I bought yesterday. I went upstairs to both rinse my face and shave with the machine. I put on a black beanie and a hoodie and it was done. I was ready. I left like that. I ate, nothing I think, and took my pills.

I got to Rene on time. I asked Catherine if she wanted me to go to her house. I could just come home, shower and eat something. She said it would be better to let it to some other time. We would lose much time if I ate and showered before. I don't mind. I have the document shared from Paola, and the rest of the uninterpreted tests of my patient and the themes I haven't really studied for the tests.


## 2017-01-19

I dreamed something. Differently than that other time that I relived the experience of frustration of hair dysphoria, this time I was and felt feminine. The first dreams were again in a scholar context. This wasn't the same location that repeats over and over in my dreams of the campus where I attended in grade school. This time it was a university, except that it wasn't the one I know and am familiar with.

I shared the classroom with Catherine. One of the professors attended after a series of missing classes the whole semester and gave some sort of speech about his grading rubric and shit. For the firs time in my whole life, the students dared to raise their voice. And I was one of those. Catherine was first and said how she saw it unfair. I defended her against the illogical rebuttals of said professor. I can't remember textually what was said.

Then, in a change of scenery we were all in some sort of hall or theater. Another professor, this time a woman, was giving some sort of cathedra. The students weren't conformed with what was said. Some got up and left. Then others until most did.

Finally in the last scene, somehow I reunited with a classmate of grade school. Ismael, I think he's called. He used to have a sister when I knew him. I think she's younger than him. Their mother is a medical doctor. I haven't seen him since 6th grade. No, I haven't talked to him since jr high. I had hacked Xennia's e-mail. I knew her password, and in a burst of guilt I confessed and told her to change it. Maybe that was the reason we stopped talking. The last time I talked to him was when in a instant messaging conversation he asked me, no, told me, to give Xennia her password back. It was a misunderstanding. In those times what was habitually referred as hacking was when somehow, usually through social engineering, yo change their password and locked them out of their account. He thought I had done that and refused to "return back" her account. But that wasn't it. I tried to explain that there was nothing to return. I told her to change it if she wanted to, but that was the most I could do. He kept insisting to just give her password back, so I ignored him.

Both of us liked her. I think she was my first crush. Sweet innocent infatuation. More than 12 years later I'm a transgender woman in a lesbian relationship and she's probably asexual. Who would had known?

In the dream I was invited by him to his house. He showed me a room where there were lots of pictures. I recognized some people in them that I really don't know. And lastly, on the last few, I saw myself when I wasn't actually myself. A young little boy with short hair and sad eyes playing the piano, and in other posing with his parents to the camera failing to smile.

"I guess I have changed a lot".

Before that he had looked at me and asked me with a face of wonder if the hormonas had changed my Adam's apple. I told him I didn't have much to change.

His mother arrived and noticed me. She asked me if I was there to visit, I can't remember the name she said but I assumed it was his sister. I told her no, that I was with him. She made some face and a comment. I think it was "Wow, right about time". It was awkward but at the same time, validating.

I woke up.

I didn't do much today but sleep. My mother left in the morning because the classes weren't officially suspended. She and Luis arrived an hour after noon. I was woken up several times in the morning. One of those was a call from Lili asking me when was my birthday. I told her the date and she was amazed that it had passed already. We set a date for a celebration. I told her something nice and calm, and mentioned the Cafe del Mundo. It will be next Wednesday around 5.

Catherine left for work and came back.

I haven't really studied but I did advanced the projects of Paola. I added a Unit about Communication to the program and found some references. Today I downloaded various articles about Transgender people. Mostly are in english and just two are regional or in Spanish. I could use those to hunt for more references later.

## 2017-01-20

The plan of this day was supposed to be that I'd get up in the way early morning. I remember setting the alarm by 8 the first one, a second one half an hour later and the last, as an emergency, to 9:20. I had calculated roughly that I would be needing time to shower, brush my teeth, shave and do all of my morning ritual with enough spare to be able to go to the Municipal Palace and do the procedure of solicitation for the copies of my birth certificate. I didn't know how much time would I need. I didn't even know if there would be a parking lot available for me to use. After doing all of that, it was a must that I'd be available before noon so I could see my patient for his last session of testing.

I don't remember if I dreamed something. This has become some sort of cliche in all of my writing. Either I spent several paragraphs on the dream of the night. Like yesterday's that more than half of the entry was about narrating the dream I had, specially because of its difference to the one before which reminded me of the very known but recently forgotten sensation of dysphoria. Either that, or that phrase.

I was in grade school, older than 7 but younger than 12, when I was in the car and my godmother mentioned something about dreams. We dream all nights, she said proudly of her new discovered knowledge. "I don't", I told her. I tried to remember and there were countless nights dark and black. That weird occurrence of closing my eyes in the night and opening them by day. An eye blink that last the whole night. "No, you do. It's just that you don't remember".

I didn't believe her. There must had been a mistake or her information was wrong. It wasn't that I didn't remember. I knew about those times, getting out of bed with the experience and knowledge of that different reality and seeing that life drift away into oblivion and vanish.

I grew up, and I left that circumstance along with the rest of the memories about her and them and those times.

In school I researched about the stages of sleep, I knew about REM stage and their duration and nature. In college I review them and actually understood them. I left behind the concept of dreams as these metaphysical manifestations of a different reality or a premonition of the future. I don't even buy the psychoanalytical stance of unconscious manifestations of repressed emotions or pulses.

I got up not at 8 nor 8 and a half. I even postponed the 9:20 alarm to ten minutes later. I enjoyed all of that time of sleep and rest. The bed with fresh cleaned sheets was a delight I had completely forgotten about. Even Nymeria, I think, accompanied me after the sun rose and my father left to work.

I showered and shaved and did all of the things I do in the morning. My outfit wasn't feminine but it wasn't masculine either. I wore the red hoodie and black leggings that look like skinny jeans. I didn't wore any make up. I expected to be asked about my name and information. I didn't know how the people would react.

I left the house around 10 and a half. It was raining, but since the classes were suspended since yesterday, I assumed there would not be as mush traffic as another rainy day. I drove as if I would be going to my mother's school. The trip my father took countless of times when I was in jr high or had L's age. This time I was driving the jetta. It was actually the same car that my father drove me in. And this time my hair is long. And I don't look like an Ivan.

I got there but found no parking lot. Not close, anyway. There was one with space on the other side of the "White offices". I walked across them and the ICBC in the rain, with my dark red tennis of canvas soaking wet. I got to the Palace and asked for information. The woman in the booth was actually nice. I got inside and again, asked for information on the Civil registry. I waited in line until I was called. Nobody asked me any information. I gave the copy and just stated that I wanted three copies and they had to be "Fidel copies of the book". I went to the cashier and paid.

I saw my patient. Lili waited with me in the waiting room until her patient arrived. She asked me some questions. First if I was already attended. I told her I was waiting for My patient. "Oh, so you are a psychologist, then." She used the feminine word.

Lately, I assume that all the times people gender me correctly they do it out of a niceness and support.

I came back home and the light went out for like half an hour. Luis did have his session. L did have their session. When they returned, I heard my mother whisper something to my dad. She told me that she had to ask me some things. I kept insisting and she told me what about. The psychologist told her that L does act differently with her. L lets themselves be however they feel. They also keep some information.

The therapists asked my mom about signs that I would have caught. She didn't believe her when she told her that I was surprised. "Sit with your daughter and ask her for the subtle signs she caught, ages and timeframes. She must had seen something"

I did. Oh sure, I did.

## 2017-01-21

I'm on my bed after hitting myself falling from the stairs. There is No internet. I returned from cathys house. I did studied today.

Inwont be doing the whole entry.


## 2017-01-22

The day before today I cheated. I had returned from Catherine's house and there was no internet home. I used my mother's phone to made the words. I didn't had the energy nor patience to type them all in the little keyboard of that iphone.

It was Saturday, the first day of my second to last weekend before the trip. I had talked with Catherine about plans of meeting, seeing each other. We haven't seen the latest episodes of Sherlock. In the morning, no, the night before, we both fell asleep talking about it. We didn't agree on anything. It was my turn to drive, so I would be the one going to her house instead of her, even though I had the episodes recorded in my DVR.

Eventually, in the morning, she told me that she would be going out with her mom to Costco and some other places. Maybe she could ask to return earlier so we could meet. At the end we decided against it, so I didn't shower and stayed in bed reading about cualitative research methodology.

In the afternoon she sent me a message that she was already home. Had I showered by then? And she laughed. I hadn't. I didn't feel like it. I had given up to the opportunity of seeing her. Thinking about showering and changing and getting ready was a bother that I preferred to avoid. I had to study. I have to. The days keep getting fewer. The number is going down and I'm afraid I'll end up failing the exam because of hubris.

I used that as an excuse. Catherine bought it at first but then let show her disagreement with it. "But... no, you're right, you do have to study". "...It's just a little upsetting that you study just in my free day."

She was right. I told her to give me an hour and I'd be leaving. I showered and put on jeggings, the same ones I'm wearing. The ones I used a year and a half ago in my first Pride Parade, and the ones I bought the first times I went clothe shopping with her full of nerves and fear. I wore them and the blue blouse I bought with my mom. The one that's labeled as a "boyfriend" cut. It's styled as a garment of clothe that a girl borrows from her boyfriend. It's made just to look as if it's ill-fitting. I don't know if it's a little ironic or just paradoxical that after my transition I sometimes keep using men clothes with the sole intention of them looking "unfit".

I arrived at her house. She was out in the balcony when I parked the car. I had already eaten the second biscuit from the morning, but she told me that we would eat at her house. She and her mother bought ribs like the other time that I went. We ended up watching a movie instead of the sherlock episodes.

Her mother gendered me correctly the whole time. Her father, on the other hand, slipped some times in the plural words.

Was it yesterday, too? L had asked me to borrow the 3DS cable. I could not find it. Maybe it could be on the shelf where all of the cables and stuff lies while I look for a place to put them. Maybe it was behind the night table, connected since the last time that I used it. The reason L wanted it was because their cable was broken.

I looked for it after not being able to locate it. Had I lost it? He had just given it to me. It was where it was supposed to be. I opened the door to give it to them, but L was already with our father trying to repair the broken one. I left it on the table. 5 or 10 minutes later that they finished. My dad told them to bring me back the cable.

"Dale el cable a... uh, regresaselo".

He stopped himself from making a reference to me. He avoid using the old name, but didn't dare to pronounce mine. It was an uncomfortable laugh.

The internet came back shortly after I had done the words.

Ive been watching the series The OA. I'm just one or two episodes until the end.

I have a backache that's been upsetting me. It started mildly today, but as the night has been setting it has been getting worse. I hope it fades away soon. I should lie down on the bed and rest. Tomorrow I have to get up early and go to the lab. 6 weeks after my session with the endo is supposed to fall on Thursday, but I worry that he would want to see me soon and I won't have time to meet before my departure.

Time is running fast and catching up.

## 2017-01-23

I'm cold. My fingers are stiff and kind of frozen. Each movement is like the breaking of ice cubes. It's not unbearable, on the contrary, the cold is something that brings me back to my first days in Spain. The only time that I remember being colder than then is once that we went to the Theater of the university to see someone's school show. I can't remember if it was Luis' or Miguel's. Probably the latter. I was wearing the hoodie that I sometimes use for staying home, except then it was new. I remember thinking about finding someone known and being recognized. The wind was piercing, like a sharp dagger that scraped the bones. Every blow was a penetration that went through the clothes and skin. I've never been colder than then.

Was it in the morning or late at night that I cancelled the alarm? I should be getting to bed soon. In the agenda is written for today the appointment with the lab. I had the alarm set to 7 in the morning. I reconsidered and postponed it to today. It's not the beginning of the week, but I could use the opportunity of going out to pick up my birth certificates on the way. I had thought about taking Nymeria to the vet and then going to the lab, but I guess I'll just take her Wednesday in some free time I find. Later my parents can take her to shower and getting her hair cut. I'll be leaving her in a little more than a week.

I finished grading the tests and almost done with the evaluation report. I haven't talked with Lili about making the appointment of our patient to deliver him the results. I guess I can deliver the report to her to read it beforehand. I think I'll leave the conclusion for tomorrow. As soon as I finish these words I'll get into bed and sleep.

Tomorrow will be another free day for my mom and L. Miguel will return to classes normally. The showers haven't stopped.

Wednesday will be my second to last session. I haven't decided if I'll tell Rene to close the process right then and there. Maybe the last session could be the day before my departure.

Catherine sent me a message some moments ago telling me, the University sent us some information about the time and place of the exam and it requires us to answer back with a confirmation. I had seen the notification in the home screen of my phone but it was just the telling of a new message, there was no sign of its importance.

Little more than a week.

"I'm both excited and scared about our leaving".

Today I marked some apartments that I found on the listing page. The prices are different but the zone is almost the same.

I have still the backache that's been annoying me for a couple of days. I remember the time we flight to Guadalajara I had it as well, one or two weeks before our departure. Today it was worse than ever. My mother told me to make some pasta. Then she and L could go to Costco. I did it or at least tried. Looking for the spaghetti was excruciating, but trying to hold the pan so I could fill it with water literally brought me to tears of pain and desperation. I climbed the stairs after looking for anti-inflammatories or pain relievers and not being able to find any. Upstairs I asked them. Seeing my mom still in bed after all day, and my grandmother not hearing me, made me scream at them.

I had to lie down. My father bought some at the pharmacy and they've really helped. My grandma prepared some tea. My mother did take my prescription and found some boxes. She returned with a plastic bag instead of the usual paper one. I asked her if they had it. She told me they did but they were expensive. I grabbed the bag surprised. She told me she payed 500 pesos for them. I looked at the receipt and checked. She bought 30 boxes of 14 pills each for 20 pesos each one. Less than a dollar. I paid the same amount a couple of weeks ago and they have almost ran out. The boxes will last me approximately three months.

How many boxes should I take with me? Will I last more than three months there?

Not even knowing how long I'll be there, is something that keeps me nervous.

## 2017-01-24

Without realizing it yet, I'm done with all the things that I had in mind. The report of the evaluation is finished and saved, waiting to be printed, signed and delivered. The three copies of the original birth certificate are in the folder. The results of the blood analysis are on the web. There is a message on my outbox of the cellphone, but because I have no credit it wasn't delivered right. There is another one telling me it was sent "upon charge", but I can't be sure that he'll read it. Tomorrow I'll buy some on my way to Rene. Nymeria is clean and with hair short. Like the phone credit I'll take her tomorrow for the medicine. There is half a tank full of gasoline in the car. The card is activated and I've set up a NIP. So it's all done. Item by item are being checked off my list.

I woke up early in the morning, not as soon as the first alarm, but before the last. Nymeria was by my side. The pain receded. I got up and showered. It was around 7 in the morning. I went masculine to the laboratory. Not like the first time that the beard could be seen and my clothes were all masculine but the underwear, but similarly. It was the same jeans but the purple blouse. On top I wore a red think hoodie. I didn't apply any make up. I think it's the first time that I went to the lab without. Did I wear some the last time?

I'd be lying if I wrote that I was calm and sure. I got out of the car was received by the same man who opens the door. I've been there 6 times, or is it 5?, to that same place. I was called as Miss Sofia by the cashier and asked some information. Everything usual. I saw the paper and noticed the big F on the gender marker. Everything was safe.

I passed to the chair and the questions continued. They always asked about my medication, and I've always wondered if that's information enough to assume of me being trans. Usually young people don't take hormones, less with a diuretic with known effects of being antiandrogen.

I was sitting on the chair, I don't remember it the blood was already drawn or not. The phlebotomist looked at me and asked something that I didn't quite got. She repeated herself "when was your last menstruation?". I smiled shyly and told her "I don't have them".

Maybe she glanced at the order and specifically the medication I listed. Maybe she had noted some signs but not realized it completely. She looked at me again, and wondered: "oh, like transgender?" "Yes" I replied.

I guess it would have to happen sooner than later. I smiled and kept smiling along the day.

I noticed in the paper that I could pick up the certificates from noon until 2pm. It was way too early, so I returned home. I decided to take Nymeria to the vet, I could get her the profilactic and ask about the haircut and bath. I left her there. They took her. They checked twice, even three times that she had all of her vaccines. They would call me around noon to pick her up. Again I returned home. It was, lonely. It hasn't been really unusual opening the door to find and empty house. I guess I've grown accustomed to the hopping joy of Nymeria's reception. How will I do without her next week?

I told my mom about my picking up of the certificates and she offered me the keys of the parking lot in her school. I arrived and was walking towards the Palace when my phone rang to tell me that I could pick Nymeria up. It was surrounded and guarded by police. My father told me yesterday how it was closed because of the manifestation recently and it being taken. The police had the entrance guarded and were asking all the people entering of their motive and destination. When the officer looked at me, he asked me with just a "girl".

I told him and he let me pass. Will I stop being nervous about the presence of authority? I can't imagine how it would had been had I gone like this to pick up my militar service card.

Tomorrow I'll see Liliana. I sent her a message asking her when to see our patient but she didn't answer. This is the last one before my trip. I don't know when will I return. It could be months, it could be just a couple of weeks. I could just write that this is the last report I'll have her sign for me, just then the return after the two failed exams and continue in her office.

I hope I can find some place to live soon and make the changes to my papers. That would be good enough. More than enough.


## 2017-01-26

The front pocket of my gray hoodie is broken. Nymeria bit it and I didn't realize it until it was already too late. Yesterday I cheated the words. I had time to do them. There was an hour until midnight when I was home, but I decided not to. Did I cheat in my home or before returning?

It was a long day. I had thought about taking Nymeria in the morning, but decided against it. I slept the extra hours and got up just having enough time to get ready before therapy. I showered and shaved. What did I wear? I put on the black jeans and a striped white long sleeved t-shirt. I left without any make up. Rene's was my first stop and errand of the day.

I drove there. I parked the car where I usually do. It was before that, though. I was on the turn from the Las Americas Blvd, where the street is closed and you have to make a U-turn to get into the other boulevard. There was a traffic congestion there. I made the turn and barely found space so I could let the traffic continue up-way behind me. After two red lights and staying on that turn, I glanced to my right to the man in the black car next to me. It was a young man, unknown to me. He wore a camouflage beanie and a light blue jacket. He noticed my sight and met it. There was a woman next to him, and a young girl on the backseat. I could just see the hair from the lady in the front. It was a straight long dirty blonde hair. Familiar hair. But it could not be. She works an office job, why would she be driven by some man with a child? The woman was turning to the other way.

By then I had already returned my eyes to the road. So I turned again, just to confirm it wasn't her. It would bring an end to that neurotic uneasiness of my mind. She barely turned but the man's face was still on the way. Just her lips and mouth were seen. Pink pouty lips on a white face. Familiar lips. Really, it couldn't really be her, could it?

The lights changed and the black car's lane got to move before mine. It was a black Mirage. The name was a teasing wordplay.

I mentioned that situation with Rene, and then later with Catherine when I arrived at her house. She didn't seem to like it that much.

I went to Catherine's I offered her to bring her to my home and take a uber to the office. I asked her to seeing her earlier, just after my session. We went and picked up the pizza. We barely eat and came home. We had just enough time. Here Nymerie tried to climb her legs and jumped to meet her. I finished with my make up and we left.

There was a meeting with a friend of Lili's. I didn't notice at first she was deaf. I thought it would be awkward the communication with her. She reads lips and talks fluidly, but... there was something. Do people feel that way about me, when they know my "situation"?

Something in her story almost brought me to tears. Was it the part about having a secret and living this two lives? Some part of her being hidden from everyone, from the world.

From there Iris gave us a ride to both Catherine and me to the Cafe. We drank and ate. It was nice. Graciela, the director of APSOR, accompanied us. It was really nice. I am glad of meeting her.

Today was another day. Yesterday we set the meeting with Lucas, my latest patient. This evening at 5. I did nothing today but wait 'till then. Both of us waited 20 minutes to Lili to receive us. I had thought she was with a patient, but she had forgotten about the appointment. I gave the results. It was a little awkward when Lili gave him an ultimatum. He has to meet with the psychiatrist before their meeting this Saturday.

I shared with him my experience with both depression and gender dysphoria. The utility of the medication calming the numbness and the fog of the mind.

Tomorrow I'll see the gang.

My dad approached me when he got home. It was awkwardly and clumsy. He asked about the hotel where I would be staying. Then he asked me when was I planning on returning. I told him it depended on how everything went.

"Return, came home and you can go back later", It wasn't an order but it didn't feel so much as a proposition either. Was it a begging?

Does he want me home? Does he want me here? Does he want me safe?

Or is he just not ready to let his son go and not returning?

## 2017-01-28

It's been both a short and tired day. The countdown on the assistant page in my phone keeps getting smaller. 0 and the departure day are closer than ever.

"Happy trip, Cath and Sofy", says the cartel that Chevo and Jessica made for us. Did I do something yesterday besides the planned? I don't remember most of the early day. It was Friday. Both L and my mom went to school. Miguel was away, as well. I slept with Nymeria and postponed, again, taking her to the vet. It's been three days since the supposed one that I should had taken her to take a profilactic.

L is in the living room watching the "Chumel Torres show". I tease him about it, but I think my dad sometimes sees it, too.

Yesterday I got out of my room in the early morning before they left. I ate two burritos and then returned to bed. I took my pills. The organizer is empty, should be filling it now.

I showered and got ready. I painted my nails. I even shaved my legs after I don't know how many weeks. I put on my clothes and did my hair. I even applied make up. It was going to be a party. It was supposed to be a farewell gathering in Paola's home.

I told Catherine she could come here and we could both take a ride from my dad. She agreed. The Uber's fare to my house was estimated at first at 120 pesos the first time she checked it before getting ready. Later, it was estimated at 180. I told her I could go pick her up and bring her here, she could give me the 100 pesos that she was going to pay at first.

I had already asked my dad to give me a ride, so he was a little confused when I asking him to move the car. I left the house around 7 in the afternoon. I was passing the oxxo downhill when in a message she told me that the fare now was around 80 pesos. I was at her house waiting for her to come out when I saw the offer in Facebook. It was a job offer of one of the Associations that care for Trans Rights locally. They were recruiting a HIV and health promoter, someone in the field of psychology or social work with experience with the care of minorities. It was a perfect fit. The offer had a limit to the first of february. The day before we leave.

From her house we picked some stuff at Paola's. The cooler with the beard that was left from the christmas party.

We were around Diego, her son. We were called his aunts. It feels both weird and kind of sweet. She gave us a gift. It was some kind of pouch or bag, small but useful. I know I'll find a use for it.

I remember an old dream I had of me being in the capital and the process of application to the master. I know it won't be anything like that.

Although I can't help but return to my nervousness about the process of boarding the trip or getting into the test. When I make my bags I have to make sure, completely sure that I take with me all of the papers necessary. Both of the original receipts of the bank, the printed pass to the test and my identification.

We got to Paola's. Her boyfriend and Andrea and Rafa were already there. Most of the night everyone addressed me and treated me correctly. Just once did I hear Andrea exclaim "Catherine and Ivan should play, so they get the chance".

We drank and laughed, we played and ate. We danced and sang. I got home around 5 in the morning. I woke up by 10 in the morning. L came down to my room and told me they were going to the United States and if I wanted to shower. I asked him if Miguel was ready, and if not, I'd go after him.

The second time he came I noticed my nausea and lack of energy. I was way too tired. I decided against it.

I sleep the rest of the morning. I've been reading, maybe I will finish the book before leaving. Tomorrow we'll celebrate L's birthday. Just 5 days. Monday I'll have to gather with the girls of the assoc. I'll meet RubÃ­. I should gather some more references or information. Maybe tomorrow.

## 2017-01-29

This is the end of my last weekend before my leaving. We celebrated the birthday of L in advance. I'm sitting in the computer with my pajamas on and my face cleansed. In Facebook, specifically the group of the assoc., is the confirmation to tomorrow's meeting. I made some comments and looked for some references, too.

Why do I feel like I haven't given much, then?

Am I nervous about meeting with the other girls? Will I meet some of them?

I woke up in the morning and heard the voice of my dad and L. I could had sworn that there was a paper-bag rustling. I excited my room and went to see. My dad was telling L there was no point in him buying breakfast. Then we would not get up until noon and eat it, and we were supposed to go out an eat.

I returned to bed and slept again. I know I dreamed, I dreamed lots and lots of different things. I woke up with an exhausted mind and can't remember almost nothing of those.

It was one of the afternoon when I got out of bed again. My mom was in the couch under a thick blanket Both my dad and L were ready. I felt tired and lacking energy and motivation. Am I nervous? There are just three complete days.

Tomorrow I will be leaving around two in the afternoon. Tuesday I told Catherine I could go to her house and help her with her bag. She could help me with the search of an apartment. Then, Wednesday, she told me she would come to my house to help me with my bag. Then we could continue with the look for a place of staying.

And then the waiting is over. I've been thinking about moving the books and references for studying to my kindle.

I haven't forgotten about my lack of interest in the supposed unknown subjects. They are several and I haven't even made an intent in making some research.

My mom showered after me, and then it was Miguel's turn. When he was getting ready I was chatting with Catherine. Maybe she could come with us, be with us. She had just gotten out of her shift and was on her way to Mexico. She crosses the border several times a week.

Nymeria is wandering around her own bed looking for a placer to set. I like looking at her and forgetting I won't have her with me at nights by the end of this week. Will I miss her more than she will me?

My dad and L went out to buy some material. The waiting was just for them. I told Catherine we could wait some for her, but understood if she didn't want to. She declined. I will see her soon, anyway.

My grandma heated some chicken and ate some salad with it. She had to take her pills, she said. She was waiting for us to leave in the morning.

We got to Friday's. The waitress called me miss several times. It would be encouraging and validating if it weren't for my own projecting myself into L place when I heard his high voice and she called them 'young them'. Do they feel as I felt before transitioning? Or is it more like the pain after I had already told people and thought I was seen androgynously.

I ordered a burger. So did Miguel. I ordered a Long Island Ice tea. It was the first time that I drink that. I liked it. It had tequila, rum, gin and vodka.

I guess L did have a good time. I asked my dad to stop by the grocery store to buy Nymeria some food and the pharmacy so I could buy some pills. We stopped in the River Plaza. My mother came with me to the pharmacy. She gave her card and I gave her a 500 bill after she extended her hand. I guess my father noticed, because this evening, instead of 600 he gave me a thousand pesos.

I have around 6000 counting the the money I will use for therapy and the one I have to give Catherine for the stay in the hotel.

Were I not to find any place to stay, I guess I would go the second to last day of Catherine's stay to a motel and asked how does it work with me being a trans person. I should not think about failing the search.

I don't know what will happen. I have several days. I will find something. Everything will work out alright.

## 2017-01-30

The days are even fewer. Three is marked in black numbers in the first box on the help screen of my phone. I had my first appointment of the week today. I reunited and met with Paola B, Melissa, Ana and got to meet RubÃ­, the activist of the Association. She is the director. "I've worked 8 years for free, so I know how is it."

Should I add Abyss on Facebook. I unfriended him, no. He's still in my friends' list, except he's in the other one. He didn't add me like the rest of my now friends. Why would he? We never had a real relationship. Sure, he was my teacher for a semester. But I doubt he remembers me, even as the person I used to be.

Catherine hasn't answered in almost an hour. She sent me some messages while we were in the meeting, she was getting off her shift and arriving home. She reminded by herself that I was busy. I answered back when the meeting was over.

How was my day?

I remember dreaming, I remember Nymeria in my dream, I remember the feeling of being in a male body, being male identified. Just yesterday I read a reference about a mexican article which studied the dreams of a transgender population. The ones who started their transition younger were statistically more probable to dream themselves as their respective gender.

My dreams, how are they?

Mostly I don't notice whom or what I am.

This time, even in my dreams were an exhaustion that accompanied me to my awoke state. I had Nymeria by my side sharing the bed under the covers. My body was heavy, immovable. It weighted tons and I was the weakest person on earth. The sleep grasped me and pulled me back. The alarm sounded and even then it was harder than ever to get out of it.

Finally I did. Grandma told me how she left me some eggs in a plate. I ate breakfast by her side and took my pills. Before the organizer is empty by the end of the week I will be sleeping in a strange bed. By the next time it will be empty again, I'll be by myself in a foreign place.

Catherine hasn't answered back.

I showered and got dressed. It was hard deciding what to wear. Should I go formally as last time?

In the morning while I was still in bed Catherine mentioned how the big, huge panties she bought at ...

Nymeria just peed on my bed. I turned after leaving the laundry basket on the floor so I could put apart the clothes when I'm finished with this. She climbed the bed and started sniffing it as a strange object. As I took my sight back and then returned it, I noticed her with her vulva on the mattress and her legs arched. I screamed at her and she stopped. I pushed her down and noticed the long dark spot of liquid.

Just thinking about not sleeping anymore with her is breaking my heart a little. She hasn't tried to climbed the bed since the third time that I pushed her down.

The message from Catherine in the morning says, "the underwear that I bought yesterday fits me" and a concerned face. I don't recall exactly how the subject came, but she mentioned that ... oh, right, she asked me if I wanted to go to the birria's tacos that are close to the office. I asked her about when.

"I was thinking about tomorrow in the morning, and from then I could go to your house to help you with the baggage. I think it's better than Wednesday that the day is cut by your therapy.

I said that if I made the suit tuesday, I would need to leave clothes out for both wednesday and thursday, without to count the ones that I'd be wearing that day. That was what I said, but besides that there was something that bothered me about changing the plans we already had.

We haven't talked much today. There was that in the morning, and then my course.

The local study that would had been done on the local trans population might become national.

Rubi gave me her card and offered me help with a contact she had in there who works in the registro civil and also could help me in case I don't find anywhere to live.

It's reassuring having a back up plan, or knowing of something else in case something comes up wrong.

When I told Catherine, I said I would contact her later. I guess she took in the wrong way. She said she didn't understand why not now. She could help me with a place to stay. I tried to explain to her that I'm not comfortable reaching out instantly to her. Preferable I would like to live near the University. She insisted, I know it wasn't her intention, but I felt again pressure on something that it's hard for me and I haven't felt any support on her behalf.

That was the last messages she sent me.

I try to change the subject, asking about the time we would see each other tomorrow. But she ignored my question and just commented how the dollar is lower. She hasn't answered since then. In a quarter it will be two hours since that comment of hers.

She had mentioned that she felt sick with her food and was trying to puke when I just got home. Maybe it's that. Maybe she fell asleep.

I don't know.

It's been typical lately that the plans stay shapeless the night before until the morning when we have to give them form in a hurry.

Maybe we won't see each other neither tomorrow nor after.


## 2017-02-01

The entry from the day before today is plagued with the word cheater. Why did I do that? I remember being tired. No, I was in bed. In the early evening. In the morning I got up and showered. Catherine would come pick me up, we'd be going to eat breakfast after... what was she going to do?

It wasn't. I think I stayed in bed while she showered. She proposed me to bring the birria instead of picking me up and going ourselves to that recommended place. I showered and got ready pretty fast. She came and picked me up. I did not wore make up. My clothes were leggings and a loose sweater. Everyone gendered us correctly. We did go to the "Tio Pepe"'s. I ordered two tacos of birria and one of potatoes. They were all really good. We returned home and she helped me browse for apartments. It was disheartening. Was they after or before the bag? It was after it. At first we returned from the restaurant and I met the clothes taken out of the drying machine.

It was rushing, and stressing, she wanted to start but I had to put the clothes back to the closet. She didn't understand why did I have to, if we were going to put them in, anyway. Finally I did, and we started. We were going in order, first pants, then t-shirts, then long-sleeved blouses, hoodies, dresses, etc... Until we went through all of my closet. The pants were dirty. I just put them apart and threw them to the washing machine.

When the bag was filled with the clothes that I'd be putting in later, I set it aside and we sat in front of the computer to see the apartments. We browsed the ones I had marked and then made some new searches. It was really disheartening noticing the majority of them asking for only girls. Thinking about asking for information and being rejected because of the information in my official papers or my genitals makes me feel hopeless. After looking and saving several of them I lied on the bed and shyly cried and hugged Nymeria. I don't know if Catherine noticed or not.

She left after an hour, maybe. I don't remember what else did I do. In the evening I was really tired and went to bed. I slept and didn't got up until late at night. When I exited the room, both of my parents and siblings were already home.

Today was and is another day. The last day before the trip. I got up in the morning knowing it would be harder tomorrow to leave Nymeria on the bed. I went to Rene. I stopped at the bank and filed a deposit of two thousand pesos to my debit card. With Rene it really was a closing session. I starting talking about how I remembered or recalled the first time I went to his office. How different did I looked then than how I do now. We continued on that train of thought. All the changes I've gone through, what I've accomplished and what was something that was left to work with.

He gave me a palming on the shoulder similar to the one that he gave on my last session as "Ivan".

"This time there won't be a "See you next time", I said mortified.

I've done this before. I've left home. I returned, except I didn't. Ivan left three years ago and I came back in his place, in his clothes and in his role.

Will something like that happen? Will I return differently? Will I make it? Will I came back triumphantly in more than a month from now? Or will it be like my father advised me, and I'll return defeated with my tail between my legs and my head sunk.

I'm smart, I'm strong and brave. I can make it. I can.

I have to study more. I have to read and prepare. The day after tomorrow, no, the one after that is the test.

I have to find a place to live. I have lots of things to do and worry about. Nymeria, nymeria, what will happen with her?

I have still the backpack and the handbag yet to fill. My laptop and books and notebooks. My pills. Will I hug her tonight? Will she be here waiting for me when I return. Will she still love me the same? Will I cry tomorrow before I leave?

Will I cry in a week after I'll be alone.

## 2017-02-02

I remember being in a hotel sitting just like this, with the computer in the desk and behind it a mirror in which I can see myself typing. This is the first entry in this new city. I've been here before in what seems as other different life. It was like 20 years ago. It was a different me and a different city. The only thing I remember is walking through a park, getting in a ride that resembled a working machine and taking a picture behind a wall with a cowboy and a horse painted with their faces being holes in which you pose.

Me, I am 20 years older, I am no longer a little boy but a grown woman.

I woke up four hours after midnight. Nymeria was in the bed with me under the sheets. At first she was energetic and biting. I could had let her go to her own bed, but knowing it was going to be the last night in who knows how many that I'd share with her, I insisted and grabbed her. Eventually we fell asleep. It's hard for me to even estimate the hours I did sleep. I remember putting an alarm half an hour before the hour I wanter the getout of bed. I was awake when it started playing. My heart broke when I left Nymeria on the bed even just for showering.

I got ready. I did my hair and put on the clothes. The bags were all ready. I played chess with L before leaving the house. I went for Nymi and grabbed her to the table with me. I wanted to be close to her.

Everyone came downstairs eventually. My father drove the pick-up with me and my siblings. First we took L to their school. On the way there he mentioned how they were 13 already and it came to me how it is their birthday. I didn't even hugged them. Will they miss me? They asked me since last night about playing chess but I had to answer negatively because I hadn't made the baggage.

The next stop after the jr high school that came after the grade school where both me and Miguel attended was the airport.

We got there around seven. My father parked and accompanied me to make the check in. I had just registered the suitcase when Catherine and her mom arrived. Catherine's mom called me beautiful. My mother posted a picture of me outside the house just leaving. I was wearing a closed hoodie, no make up and my hair tied back in a pony-tail. "Do I resemble Ivan?" I asked Catherine. That was the intention. I would need to appear like the person in my id to aboard the airplane. She had said that "uh, yeah(?)".

When I saw the picture that my mother posted, even then I looked feminine.

The flight was tiring. I fell asleep on the last third of it. I was coming and going in a state of dreams. I confused reality with my dreaming.

Arriving at the airport, we waited for our suitcases and took a cab to the hotel. From here we went straight to the meeting of roomies that was near Roma. We would need just to take a line of subway and three stops of the bus. It was tiring and stressful and annoying. I got lost getting into the subway station that's just two streets next to the hotel. In there Catherine asked for a card and was told that they didn't had any. Then, she asked for a ticket and was replied in a really rude manner.

When I asked for my own ticket, the salesman gave it to me and just stayed quiet. I asked him how much was it and he answered back, again, in the most patronizing way possible.

We were confused how to take the train the correct way. We stumbled a little but got to our destination. Later, when it was time to take the bus, we found out they didn't have any cards left and that was the only way to board. We had to ask for a favor to a passerby, which, when he tried, could buy one card.

We ate a burger. We got into the wrong building, and by when we had realized it I didn't have neither the energy, nor the will to socialize and meet new people.

I asked her to come back. It was the last of the busy hour. We were trapped in both the bus and the subway. It was weird boarding the first wagon exclusively for women. I felt as if I were intruding, as if I was incognito and could be discovered. Did that mean that all the women how saw me there, saw me as a woman? Maybe they thought I was like those men that were there by mistake or just because of carelessness.

Tomorrow we'll go to CU. I should look around to advices of apartments and ask for vacancy.

## 2017-02-03

Today, this moment, more than ever should I be studying or reviewing the information for the test for tomorrow. Right now it's eight o'clock in the afternoon. The only stuff that I've reviewed is what I've read in the first part of the flight to come here yesterday.

Catherine has uploaded a post to Facebook with a picture of herself in front of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. We went today to the University. We didn't got out of bed in the early morning. I asked her to come to sleep early after the itinerary we had yesterday. I was extremely tired, exhausted. Even after catching the movie of Sweeney Todd in the Warner Channel and loving that the songs were in their original english I couldn't stay awake. Catherine told me in the morning that she couldn't sleep and noticed how I did really fast.

It's been months since I've wanted to sleep by her side.

Did I shower before or after doing the words? Just stepping to the shower with her made me have an erection. I felt the skin stretch to the point of discomfort and it brought me a mixture of both pleasure and pain. It wasn't until the morning, though, before I was completely awake nor ready to get out and start the day, that we started kissing and touching our bodies.

There was a comment in the airplane of how I move a lot while I sleep, supposedly more when I am dreaming. Last night I was in a university. It wasn't the national one that we would visit later this day, but it wasn't either the one I am accustomed to. In there, I noticed a girl that resembled my ex. She had really short hair. Its tips were barely showing under the edge of a beanie. Later, when I passed through a classroom I saw a familiar coat and her backpack. I felt really uncomfortable. Why would I find her there? What could she be doing that would led her up to that place.

Later something happen with a classmate that wanted me to confront her. I remember, too, not wanting her to see me with the clothes I was wearing. I don't know exactly what were they. I thought how many other times I looked way more feminine. How do I usually dream about myself?

We took the metro after eating breakfast in the restaurant of the hotel. It was way more empty than yesterday's evening when we returned. We took it all the way to Copilco. It was a trip of around 40 minutes. Tomorrow we plan to wake up in the early morning and get ready to be leaving around 6 in the morning. We have to be there by 8 and a half, and the exam will start by 10.

We found the auditorium after struggling with the maps and the entrances.

Something happened just like that when, after leaving the university, we took a bus to a plaza to look for a ATM of my bank where I could withdraw money. We finally got to the mall but could not find the entrance. We wandered around and around but couldn't find the ATM. Later, when we ate in the colony where Andrea lived, I tried to withdraw from a different ATM and was charged 17 pesos.

In our trip around Copilco and Coyoacan we gathered the little pieces of paper with the numbers of the people offering them. Most of them asked for just a specific gender, or tutors who could aval the process or letters of recommendation.

I was really nervous about the process of calling or contacting them and explain my situation.

We got to the hotel and started with that. I dreaded the idea of using the phone and exposing my voice and history being vulnerable to discrimination. Sometimes we took the first wagons of the metro that is exclusive to women. I feel their eyes on me. I feel as an intruder. I don't have a piece of paper or something that validates me. I have nothing but my appearance.

When we exited the Sanborns, one of the people that passed us was a person visibly masculine with a skirt and a light sweater. They were noticeably uncomfortable, with a binder or notebook on their chest. I saw their eyes and found the fear sometimes I want to hide.

As soon as I finish these words I will get to study.

Tomorrow we'll see the first room. Then Sunday. I'm scared of taking them. I am scared of being denied. I am scared of not finding anything and end up homeless.

## 2017-02-04

The test is done. We've done it. I feel like a huge load has been taken off my shoulders. It was a short test, it could had been an ordinary semester exam from my time in the bachelor's. It wasn't hard, but it wasn't that easy either. I guess I was more nervous about the dealing with the registration and the id than the questions themselves.

Last night, we finished with the calls and messages of the rooms. I've seen the first one already, it's shared with two students of UNAM, one of math and the other of physics. I didn't told them I am trans, but I can't be sure that they didn't realize it. Tomorrow we'll visit the other two rooms that we agreed to. Both of them know about the discordance with my identity and the presentation and name of my id. They seemed okay with it. The first one, I told her out of despite and as a trial to see what would be sharing it with strangers. It's really hard, this feeling of being vulnerable, of being a marginal person.

After that we studied. She finished before I did. I stayed on the other bed with the screen lighted up and reading about the statistical analysis of testing of hypotheses. Not much later did I turned it off and accompanied her under the sheets. I took my pajama bottoms and hugged her. This time she fell asleep first and she was the one with the movements and the snoring. Not much after I slept as well.

It was around 5 hours of sleep that we got before the alarm brought us back to this foreign city. As I opened my eyes, a cold and sharp blow of air cut me in half. I felt it through the sheets, my skin and bones. It woke me up more than any cup of coffee would have.

I took the sheets with me to the bathroom and showered and got ready. I wore a male shirt, I tied my hair and didn't wore any make up.
I looked ambiguos enough to lessen my worry about the procedure and not too much to feel it unbearable.

We took the metro a couple of minutes after it opened and still it wasn't that empty. We got to Copilco and stopped at a mexican dinner to eat breakfast. The waitress didn't gender us. We waited in the faculty outside the auditorium. There were lots and lots of people, easily enough we surpassed the thousands.

The exam wasn't that hard. More than half of the questions I answered with the surety that they were correct. A quarter, I guess I think of them correctly, but they might be wrong. The rest, though, I hesitated before putting my answer, and most of them even changed it afterwards.

I won't know the results until the end of March, more than a month from now. It's time enough to deal with the papers and procedures.

After the test and killing some time around Copilco, we went to the subway station where we would meet with the potential roommate that would show us the room. He was the only one that didn't know really about my transness, but I was wearing ambiguos clothes and it might had been noticeable. Neither he nor the other roommate made any comment or face. He even recognized me from far away as we exited the oxxo.

We came back to the room, the subway was as full, maybe even a little more, as the first day. Because of how I looked, I didn't feel comfortable enough to wander there, even if the crowd were less constricting. We experienced the first time a man pushing and getting into the line.

We got here and stopped near the market to buy some food. We got to menus to go and ate them half-naked here in the room. I bought eggs and longaniza and she, meat. It was really good. After the food and the day, I was exhausted. We lied on the bed and I couldn't help to fell asleep.

In UNAM, we sat in the grass of the faculty of humanities, there was some kind of park were lots of dogs were running and playing. My mom sent me some messages and in them shared how Nymeria cries when the evening comes or sometimes just stays at the window whimpering. I miss her. Will she recognize me when I get back?

## 2017-02-05

Catherine is about to paint my toenails. I'm sitting on the bed, the one on the right, where we slept the first night in the city. She's lying on the other one, with the her suitcase next to her and her phone on the hands. We woke up again early but didn't really had a reason to. Yesterday we didn't go to Tlatelolco nor the Zocalo because I felt asleep. We planned of getting up early and going there before visiting the first room of the day.

I have just sent the message asking for it. Saying that I want it, I'm sure.

We woke up when her alarm of the phone sounded. She was really tired, so she asked me if we could sleep some more. I totally agreed. The breakfast was from here, the restaurant of the hotel. I got... I don't remember what I was typing. I just received the message confirming the room. Just tomorrow I make the deposit and can take the room. It's a weird feeling, having now somewhere to stay. It's a huge relief and yet it's some kind of despair realizing that I don't have to return anymore.

I dressed with the intention of looking feminine but I guess my choice of clothes wasn't that obvious. After breakfast we took the subway, the first time we did use the first wagon that is reserved for woman. We got to Copilco, outside the metro station I called the woman that I had chatted with but nobody answered. We went straight to there. We got to the street and finally the house. Last night we looked for it on Google Maps and the street view showed us a green house of two flights. We got there but there was nobody to be seen. I sent another message but it stayed unlooked. I knocked on the garage door first and waited for a quarter of an hour, then a second time minutes before the time we had said we would leave.

I don't remember how was it that we decided to keep looking on the numbers of the houses down the street. It was half an hour after the agreed time. We found a house with a repeated number and the letters "bis". We kept going and my phone rang. Just moments later did we find some women outside a house that seemed to recognize why we were there.

They showed us the room. The mother, the one actually named Rosa, welcomed us and gave us a tour of the building. Before leaving, she added that "and about what you told my daughter, you don't have nothing to worry about here." She commented about the couple that lives with her daughter. We left.

From there we took the subway to Coyoacan and walked towards the Frida Kahlo's Museum. There was a line that got to the end of the street, but that was the one for the people that already had a printed ticket or bought. Catherine was discouraged of going and talked about returning. I convinced her of staying... well, she says that I told her that if she wanted togo, go... Anyway, we stood on the other lane that got to the end of the street and then came back. The end was almost to the same place that it began. A couple of minutes later she had the idea of buying the tickets over the internet in her phone. We used my debit card and it was a success.

Half an hour later we were in. We took some pictures and I posted one of them on Facebook.

There was time still before going to visit the second room, so we went to a little faire that was in a park nearby. I bought a quartz with a painting on it of the tree of Life. "Wherever you are, I'll be; wherever you go, I'll go; wherever you die, I'll die."

I think about giving it to her for her birthday tomorrow. We've made some different plans that even now I don't know what will happen.

We stopped at a coffee place and drank tea. The other room was real nice and clean. The potential roommate interviewed me right then and there and we seemed to click it off nicely.

After visiting the Zocalo and eating dinner her, I decided to sent a message to confirm the room.

And it's all done. Tomorrow I'll make the deposit and everything will be set.

I'll finally be moving officially here.

## 2017-02-06

Catherine is my age now. Today is her birthday. We woke up un the morning and I used the phone to ask for breakfast. I ordered her some pancakes with fruit, and for me scrambled eggs with bacon. The restaurant was barely opening so they told us beforehand that the order would take a while. We used the time to fool around, kissing each other and exploring under the pijamas. When she got into the bathroom they called us for a third time after telling that they didn't had any grapefruit. This time the waiter asked us if we were there, because they had sent the food but nobody answered. I told him that we hadn't heard anything. He sent her again. This time I left the door opened. Cathy didn't like her pancakes. We showered and got ready. This time I wore something more feminine and still I felt like people would see me suspiciously. It's weird, I see pictures of myself and I looked more different than the past months of my transition.

Yesterday was when a kid selling and offering something approached us outside the Museum of Frida Kahlo, and told us "Take it girl... girl, boy, I don't know".

First we went to the Vasconcelos library. We used the metro to get there. It supposedly would be open, but it was not.

No, that wasn't the first thing. Yesterday I sent a message confirming the rent of my room. Before going down the station we looked for an ATM and I made a withdraw. I took enough money to pay for the deposit and the first month of rent. There was an oxxo further down the street so I deposited the money and sent a picture of the receipt.

I officially have where to stay and sleep. Tomorrow is the last full day I'll share with Catherine. The night after tomorrow will be the last one for a while.

When we returned from the closed library, I asked Catherine to stop by the metro-bus station to see if I could buy another card. I was introducing the money when the couple next to us asked us for help. She had put in 15 pesos, but the machine didn't give her nothing in return but a receipt. I showed them how you pushed the button and just introduce the coins, it would be more than 16, but the card only costs 10, the rest is its funds. The machine threw me mine, and I exchanged it to her for her bill of 20 pesos. Catherine showed her hoy to refill it.

Her husband told her to thank the "young man... lady" he corrected himself as Catherine pointed out. People here have been accepting, but, does this mean that they see me and know I'm trans? Do policemen cloak me at the entrance of the exclusive wagon and just let me pass?

From the library we went to Tlatelolco. We stopped by the arqueological zone and saw the building where I'll be taking my other entry exam in a couple of weeks. We sat by the Plaza de las 3 Culturas. There was a plaque with the names of some of the dead students that were killed in the massacre of the 68th. Both of us felt a knot in our throats. I mentioned my interest of visiting the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires.

In there I told my family and friends that I've found a room. I chatted a little with my parents and L. My mom later sent me pictures of Nymeria looking out the window. I miss her more than I ever think I would.

We came to the Zocalo, the Main Plaza of the city. We ate tacos de canasta and shared a torta of wienner sausages. We kept going t the Latinamerican tower and saw the Bellas Artes Palace. Both of them were also closed.

In the Hotel, as we returned after the trip, we lied on the bed to rest. Catherine had her period. We fooled around without getting under the clothes. But I mentioned I was sleepy and it killed the mood. She were distant. "Every time that I start things you get either tired or sleepy".

I resented her, because I was angry at myself. She took my bra off, she left me in a tank, cold and she was the one that stopped. I made a comment, but she stopped. I used that excuse to turn around. Then I fell asleep.

We had made a reservation in a restaurant with a view to the Zocalo. We changed and went. We had an entree of avocado and tuna, beer in a cocktail with clamato, our main plates were arrachera steak for her and meatballs in a chipotle sauce for me. We took a shot of tequila for celebration and finished the evening with a corn bread with eggnog and vanilla ice cream.

We were talking about everything, the notebook that she bought yesterday and I said I would write something in it.

"I'll draw a picture of a dick in it, maybe the words "I love you" written with the little veins". She made a face and her eyes started watering. "I was going to tell you no, but I remember that you always used to draw me dicks."

She started crying. I asked her if it was a good or a bad kind of cry. "A little bit of both". "I think about it, and you'll stay here". I cried with her. Two girls in a romantic dinner sobbing before the main dishes came.

Maybe neither of us want to think about it. We had a full day still. I don't know how I'll deal with letting her board the plane.

This will be the last night that I'll share with someone I know before sleeping in a stranger's bed. In less than 24 hours I will leave Catherine in the airport and return to my new room. I live here now. I've paid the deposit and the first month of rent.

We've done...

I don't know what I was typing. I'm here lying on the bed and Catherine is sitting on the other one. Her tablet is streaming an episode of House. The one where the patient is paralyzed and can't move. He can't do anything but blink. Then he can't even do that. I remember seeing those episodes of House weekly when they were showing on air tv. I used to wait every day the were playing to catch them on the time they aired. I maybe was in jr high. Now that I am seeing it again, I can feel the emotions related to it. The frustration of not being able to communicate, the loneliness and despair. The feeling of hopelessness.

The first thing we did today was eat breakfast at the restaurant that is a block down the street. I ordered northern eggs, scrambled eggs with stranded meat bathed in green sauce and Catherine ordered scrambled eggs with sausages.

We returned and ordered a uber to take us to my new room. The next time that I enter in there I'll be alone in this monstrous city.

I broke the handle of my suitcase. The first flight of stairs was easy, the second, not even with her help could we take it without issues. When the landlady saw us with the case, she said: "This girl brought her whole closet in wheels". Catherine told me to bring the large suitcase. She's flipping me off as I read out loud what I am typing.

From there we walked towards the metro station in Copilco, looking around seeing all the little shops and tailors and beauty shops and inns and butchers around the area, my future neighborhood. We intercepted the microbus I could be able to take when I am in a rush to get into the university or to the metro station.

We traveled towards Chapultepec to visit the Forest. In there, was saw the lake and the little stands with souvenirs and bags and clothes. Both Catherine and I bought each a bag. Mine fits my laptop perfectly and I can use it as a big purse. Catherine's looks more like a backpack, but it's small enough to be used as a purse as well. She told she has always wanted something like that since for ever, but never really found one that fulfilled her wishes.

We visited the Chapultepec castle, now the national museum of history. Catherine bought me both a dreamcatcher to put over my bed as the one I gave to her from my trip to Guadalajara with my parents. She also bought for me a jewelry box. A little wooden jewelry box with a carved cover.

Exhausted we walked down the castle and another blocks looking for a place to eat. I chose a restaurant from google maps because of its name. It is called Mexsi bocu, a play with the pronunciation of Thank you in french and the mexican language. I thought it would be a corny little funny place, and it end up being a fancy french restaurant with plates way over our budget. Catherine ordered a tartar steak and I a roast beef sandwich. We were overblown by the tastefulness of their home bread.

After our dinner we walked a little more and stayed in a homey cafe sharing a frappe of chai tea.

Tomorrow is Catherine's departure. She's deciding what to wear tomorrow. I had to before we left today because I would take the rest of my clothes to the new room.

We're sitting on the bed, she's by my side. We were just talking about my money situation. I came here with 1200 pesos and 4000 in cash. Now I'm left with less than that and a month paid of rent. I have 6600 pesos in both cash and funds. My father deposited me a thousand pesos. Is it enough money? Am I still being dependent of them?

That was never the idea. Even when I lived with them my father used to give me half a thousand every week and my mother a thousand every month.

They can still help me. Not because they send me money does it mean I'm a failure.

Does it?

It feels extremely weird changing the location in Google Maps of "Home". In the app citymapper, I had the hotel as the "home" reference. I didn't want to change that, but i's the most useful app here, so I did.

Now, I already showered and am lying on this my new bed. I'm tired. It's barely 8 o'clock. I want to sleep. I feel like crying. Since yesterday I have lost count of the times I've cried.

At what time did I finished the words yesterday?

Later that night, we were both on the bed and got intimate. I don't really remember how it started. We kissed and caressed each other. We moved it to the bathroom and continued rinsing our bodies. She asked me to lie down on the floor. She did and I sat besides her. I touched her and made her come. There were red spots on my finger, she was ashamed. It's the first time that I've seen her menstrual blood.

I don't and won't have any, ever.

Just now I feel like crying again. Is it the hormones or the feeling alone in a huge city or the pictures of Nymeria that my family keeps sending me on Whatsapp.

This would be like the fifth time today.

I hear voices outside of the flatmates. They are all women, the ad asked exclusively to young ladies. Maybe that has something to do as well. I feel scared of going outside, I feel vulnerable. They are like 5. Will they accept me or see me as one?

Catherine cried when she read the page I wrote for her in the notebook she bought. Yesterday she wrote one for me in the notebook she gave me. I haven't read it. I'm a little scared.

We woke up early today. She asked me to stay asleep and in bed. Before I went to the shower she touched me and pleasured me. The orgasms I experience are way different.

We got ready and checked out of the hotel. Did we ask for an uber or did we take the metro? No, we used the metro. We walked here and I came up to leave my backpack and bag and then returned downstairs with her.

No, we didn't take the metro, we used an uber, but why? We told him to continue the street until the end. No, no, that was before, when I brought the big suitcase. This time we did use the metro while I had my backpack and the bag. Again we used the women only wagons and nobody said a thing.

From here we walked to the metro and returned to the hotel, but instead of getting in, we came down the Museum of Bellas Artes and walked to the Latinamerican tower. We made several stops in different shops and didn't even climbed the tower.

We ate outside the metro, an order of 5 tacos and half of another each.

The walk from Bellas Artes to the hotel, took us time enough to pick up her suitcase and order a uber to the airport. She did her check in and dropped her bag. We went to wings and ordered a soup each and some fries. We chatted and laughed. Did we cry there? Yes, a little.

From there we stopped at the bathroom. It was way too embarrassing for me and she does not know what happened. We waited in line to use the toilet. Two people were occupying two of the four stalls, the third was being cleaned and the fourth was the one who kept getting vacant and occupied. Catherine went and the cleaning lady finished with the stall and invited me in. I sat and peed. I shat, too. I had no intention of doing it, but it happened. I sat up and looked for the mechanism, the button or stick or whatever to flush. I thought it was a motion sensor. I put down the lid and as I walked out I heard a flushing sound assuming that it was mine.

When I got out, another lady got in. I was washing my hands when the stall opened and the lady asked how to flush it. I felt my face reddening and wanted to get swallowed by the earth.

I waited with Catherine for a little while outside the entrance of security. We cried there just as we did last night when we hugged. Just as I am doing right now.

I took the metro alone for the first time here. In Copilco I went to the other side to Walmart instead of coming directly here. The walk is a kilometer approximately. I bought groceries, 600 hundred pesos worth of groceries and walked back with them a kilometer and a half with what easily could had been 4 or 5 kilos of stuff.

I have some things to do, Paola gave us some stuff to do with the work for the association. I could do it now, but I guess I will wait until tomorrow in the library.

I might take Catherine's advice and go to the library. It might be good being outside and not hiding in this room.

## 2017-02-10

It seems that I forgot to do my words yesterday. I've been getting accustomed to the city life. I used to live in a city before as well. But the size is way different. How big is this city? It's not about its size, it's its population. I am always surrounded by people. Even in this house, in just this floor, there are easily other 6 girls, maybe more.

The washing machine is not working, it won't be fixed until next wednesday. The landlady offered to take my dirty clothes to her sister's laundry. I accepted. Just today I left the plastic bag of my clothes downstairs next to the washing machine.

This morning I slept and slept. I didn't want to get up. Now is more correct the expression getting down. My bed is sustained over the floor, I have to climb down a set of steps. A wooden-made ladder of four steps, where the second is loose. The sound of the mrs asking if she could clean the rooms. I got down in a hurry and made myself look presentable. She didn't knock on my door.

Yesterday I had planned on going to the bank or taking my pictures for the certificate of the english language I have to approve if I pass the first round of testing to the psych master. I did both. I showered and wore the white blouse that I bought yesterday at wal-mart.

I took a plastic bag with my shaving soap, brush, and razor and wrapped it around the towel. Since a couple of days ago I started going to the shower without any underwear. I can easily put the clothes over the door and put them on again after I finish. Then, I think it was yesterday, I saw one of the girls getting out of her room with a towel wrapped around her waist and a blouse on top. Maybe I could do that. It is easier to keep the towel over just half of my body than completely.

I have two days to write about and I can't even reach half of today's quota.

Yesterday I did study. I took the red notebook and wrote in it. I read about scientific notation and logarithms. It was more exciting than making the plan of the workshop for the trans ladies.

Just now I was texting Catherine how I wish I could start the process of changing my birth certificate. The only thing that I have left is the prove of home address. I guess it's not really necessary to have my ID stating my home here as well.

I read a post about a Baja Californian man who did the procedure with the T-squad, the association that offered the apartment. I could contact them if there's any issue with the prove of address.

The plan is to start it after doing the other exam.

I have to inscribe myself into the language one. I needed to pay for it in the bank. I did it. After I showered I left and walked south to the university, looking for a place to print the bank order. I guessed there could be something inside the campus, but I didn't find it. I went to UNAM store.

When I showered, the razor slipped and broke. I don't have my double edged razor anymore. How could I shave? I went to my room and shave my face with some moisturizing cream. The results were acceptable. I put some little make up to hide the shadow. In the mart I bought a spray for my feet and shaving cream and salt. There was a bank inside but I decided against getting in without the printed order.

Outside, before taking the metro I got to a picture place. The man gendered me female. I guess. He addressed me as a girl. But now that I think about it, when he asked for a name and heard mine he made a sound and a face as in confirming a theory.

Here I don't know if people address me as a female because I am seen as one or because of politeness.

I walked to Wal-mart again, but this time I went to the bank. Inside, the man who gives you the ticket told me that for the deposit I could ask his partner to help me. I told him that the paper clearly stated that it wasn't accepted the atms, but he insisted. I waited and finally the lady that helped me agreed with me.

I made the deposit, the bank teller behind the window treated me nicely. She apologized after saying my name outloud. I don't know because she realized it was a man name or because she said my last name wrong.

I went to the library to study, but I don't think I'll do it again soon.

## 2017-02-11

Days keep going as fast as ever. They are way faster. It's been more than a week since I came here. This will be my second weekend, my first one alone. I didn't realize it until yesterday when I asked at the photo center their open hours and he specified for the weekend. It's just a couple of days that I've been renting here. Yesterday I left the plastic bag for the mrs downstairs. Late in the evening I saw it still. I kept studying after returning from the failed attempt at the library.

I woke up with the explicit intention of spending most of the day studying. I prepared myself breakfast, using the stove for the first time. I scrambled two eggs with tomato and onions. Was it before or after showering? I shower and put on the long sleeved blue shirt. I know it looks masculine, but I put it on on purpose. That way I could avoid going out and spending any more money. It didn't work. There wasn't no cups for coffee nor tea here. They have drunk but I guess each have their own.

In the shower the mrs showed a room to a girl with a man. The young woman asked questions, the mrs answered them, there are a couple of girls here, some study veterinary, others psychology, she thinks. "So there are only women, then?" "Yeah..." Meanwhile I was naked in the shower cubicle trying to shave my beard with a disposable razor.

So I put on my purse without any makeup and went downstairs. There was Rosa there, the mrs, she wanted to tell me something.

First, when I slide the door one of the wood pieces fell and made a sound. "What happened?" ... "There was a sound as if something had fallen". I said nothing. Then she told me... The bag of clothes. Don't I have more? There are just so little. It wouldn't be enough for a single load. Something about the many liters of water that are used, and then again after rinsing.

"No se si te puedes esperar a traer unos dos pantalones mas, no seas malito..." Did she notice my face? Did I make any? Did I notice it or it was her reaction that reassured me? She hit lightly her forehead and apologized. "I have to get used to it".

Used to what? The only time she has seen me as a man or even known my name is in the picture of the id I gave her.

I took the opportunity and asked her about proof of address. She told me there was a mailbox next to the washing board outside with different bills by the names of her, her husband and her daughter. I could grab and use any of them.

"There is something, though. The names don't match." She reassured me that the girls, or people in general have used them without having any issues "it's just for the university".

"But that is it, this doesn't have to do with the university but with the civil registry"

She told me to just say that I'm staying with some friends, but I know it won't do it.

I just went outside and walked to Wal-mart, again, to buy a cup. In there I bought chorizo, too, and on my way back a kilo of tortillas. I ate that as a meal, potatoes with chorizo and two of them. It's weird. When I lived alone years ago, tortillas were a prized possession. Now they are some of the cheapest foods I can get.

Returning she told me that she had taken my clothes with some sheets. I hung them outside.

I've been studying. I have reviewed a little more than half of the themes. Most of them are things I already know, so it's not a fair metric.

I knew about the proof of address. So I sent the message again. This time I got a better and more complete answer. She gave me her number. I called her. Her voice took me by surprise. In her pictures I even doubted she were trans herself.

She told me that there is no problem if the proof of address has a different name than mine. I just need a copy of their id and a simple letter stating that the person is renting me: "put that they've been doing it for the last three months", and that would be it. Doing it with her I won't need an appointment. The process will take around two hours and by the end of it I'll be leaving with my pre-certificate.

Two weeks later, I can pick up the real thing.

Will they accept giving me a copy of id?


## 2017-02-13

I keep studying. The themes keep getting fewer and shorter. This might not be such an impossible test after all. Now I am lying over my bed with the laptop where the pillow should be. Studying gets tiring.

I made myself breakfast, eggs with tortilla pieces and tomato. For eating I made myself a sandwich and a bag of instant soup. I've been getting nervous about the food. I don't really get why. I guess I have enough for maybe this week. Easily for half of it. Money is not an issue either. My dad sent me another email where he deposited 1000 pesos in my account. When I checked the account online, it seemed that I have more than 6 thousand. The balance was of 5 but had another thousand in the frozen balance. Later it would adjust with the withdraws I did these week, but still, it's more than I thought I had.

I can go to Wal mart and get some more food. I have bought every of the non consumable items I need. My suitcase will do for a basket of dirty laundry. This week I have nothing to do but get ready for the test of next monday.

That's not true. I had an appointment today. I was supposed to get in Skype and attend the meeting with the girls of the association. I was all done and ready, but it was postponed because Rubi, the director, is sick and had to left for home.

Tomorrow at 3pm in pacific time.

6 days of studying and I will go to make that exam.

I sent a text message to my dr, the endocrinologist. Two or three weeks ago I checked my T levels and awaited for the setting of the next appointment. Time passed and I'm here. I don't know when does he expects to see me. I don't know when will I return. In the text I remind him that I don't know when will the next appointment be and that I am already in the capital. So I wish when to expect it so I can organize my time.

I don't know if he answered. I sent it around noon. The last time I checked it was still unanswered.

I opened Facebook and thought about posting the picture of Nymi looking out of the front window. I typed the perfect description, an open letter to her: Nymi, yes, that's my car but I'm not home. I don't know how to explain to you that I won't be coming tonight.

I didn't post it and yet I had tears running down my face.

I miss her a lot.

There was a post in Facebook today, in the group of Trans people. Someone gave advice to anyone just to do the process of change of papers. If the address in the id is not the same of the one in the proof of address, then the owner of the house has to make a letter stating that the person does live there and adjunct a copy of their id.

It's kind of what Daniela told me over the phone. It should be easier. It's a simpler reason of explaining. Why am I still nervous?

It's just asking. I won't loose anything. Even if they say they can't, I can contact the other association. There are still options.

I don't know what has happened with L.

I don't remember the day that was mentioned for their family session. How was it? How will it be, if it hasn't happened?

Are they feeling alone? Do they miss me?

Do all of my family?

My mother mentioned the other time how my grandma got up to made me breakfast. It was a fun bittersweet intention what drove my mom to share it, but it left a sour taste in both our mouths, Catherine and mine.

I should be getting down from the bed and continue with the studying session. I'm half over biology and just to start bio-chemistry. After both of those is familiar and known territory.

One week before the test. The day after tomorrow I can choose a group and date for taking the other test of english. Then it would be just wait until the second week of March, and either do the second test or wait for the last few days to the last news.

How much will I stay here? Maybe I won't pass neither of the tests and after finishing the procedure I can get back home. Maybe the dr asks me to return to see him and adjust the dosage. Maybe I pass both of the tests and have to stay here until the start of the semester.

I don't know.

First I should get the courage to go downstairs and ask for that proof and a copy of id and signature.

I don't remember if I did yesterday's words...
 It's weird, I have more time than ever. Justo today I finished both the new episodes I downloaded of the TV series I binged in Netflix and the themes of the guide for the test of the master.

Yesterday the woman didn't returned much call. I sent her a text to call me, but she didn't. Today I expected both her answer and the endocrinologist. Neither of them.

Catherine doesn't have a phone either. The screen of her iPhone is not responding so we're burdened to talk on Facebook.

It was yesterday that I sent a friend request to Zuri. The girl I had a crush on in middle school. I remember the weird sensation of both remembering my naive infatuation of yeas before, and being really happy in a relationship with another girl while she sent me a message to tell me that she had just thought about the gift I sent her and how I called her princess.

Not much later, she got a boyfriend or the one she had became serious. And then, some time later, she got pregnant.

I don't really know the reason why I sent her the request. Did I want her to accept me? Was I expecting her to recognize me?

When I asked the landlady for the papers she kept misgendering me. When I went outside to ask for the copies, I felt the people's eyes on me as I walked.

I feel vulnerable and alone. I feel tiny in this huge city.

I'm surrounded of people. Thousands, millions of them who pass me by, and glance at my body or face.

Catherine told me to give the woman today to call back. Tomorrow I could call her again.

I thought of when I called her. She was busy and just told me to meet her at Salto del agua the next day. What?

She confused me with somebody else.

Today I sent her a message through Facebook. She saw it almost immediately. She told me to call her. I did.

I'll meet her the day after tomorrow at 9 and a half. "we have to be there early because that's the time the lady that helps us gets in. We should get all the papers in order before the judge arrives, she's the one that lets me pass all of you without an appointment."

I am both excited and terrified. This is why I came here. I'm going to do what at some time I saw so so far away. I even kind of see it as a reward after getting into the master program. I'll be doing it before even doing the first test.

They will probably keep my ID. The people at the university ask for a legal ID at the entrance. Fortunately u brought my passport. I have short hair and a shade of black beard. I look nothing like that.

I hope there won't be any problem. This time I won't have Catherine by my side.

Should I tell my parents or wait until I have the pre-certificate? Why don't I want to mention it? Of what am I scared?

My mom sent me a text today, calling me sofy and asking how I've been. I told her good and studying. It might had sounded rude, but I honestly haven't done anything else.

I chatted a little with two of the girls. One, Lucy, the one that touched my hair because it was pretty, is studying anthropology at the University. She is starting.

The other, one of the group of girls, Sinaid, I think is how she's called, is doing her internship at an animal's hospital. They are veterinaries. They have a month here and will stay just two more.

She did mention my accent. I do sound different. Should I assume that they know about me?

Today I neither shaved nor showered. It might be the symptoms of depression or just the trying of not dirtying more clothes.

Tomorrow I will go for groceries and to get the copies I lack.

Friday I'll go to the civil registry, Monday I have to get up even more early to leave for my test. Tuesday I will have to have finished the project of the association because is the potential day of giving the program. I told them I could be online but I really wish I won't be able to.

I like working for them, being a volunteer. Maybe being a teacher is not what I'm best for.

It's been months since the last time I wrote in here. I stopped altogether when I continued forgetting about coming back here to type and record. How much has it been? I was already in Mexico city. Right now I am sitting in the black chair that my father bought for me in one of my birthdays. It's a month and a half before the start of the new semester, the new stage of my life.

Today I was supposed to get up in the morning to see the live webcast of the informative session to the grad school accepted students.

Did the last time I wrote in here was before my first return to hometown? I have both my birth certificate and official id. In one of the reunions with the psych team of work, an acquaintance of Ruby asked me what was my next step of transition. "What is next for you?"

It wasn't until then that I realized I'm finished with my transition. I could go to some more sessions of laser so that I don't have to worry about the hairs on my chin, or wait until the second year of HRT is over and the changes are all set. But this is it. I am done.

Is this just something that I got an urge to pick back up or is deep down the intention to actually keep with it.

What was it that brought me to this?

I am typing these words on the external keyboard connected to the laptop. I bought a different one after letting mine to Miguel. It's a mechanical keyboard with the clanky keys that made that sound that I used to hear in the television programs of when I was a child. They keys are all blank. There is no use anymore to lower my glance.

Is this it? Do I want to have something to write so I can use the keyboard?

No.

This morning after returning to sleep after there was no webcast, I dreamed with both Anna and Melisa. We were in a different town, being hosted by some aunt from my father's side of the family. It's been weird in my last dreams. I don't notice my gender. I don't really know what I was when I wake up. In this last one I know I was myself because I remember a feeling of not being able to carry all my stuff. I had a backpack with me and my purse and a phone and some other stuff.

The night before I had a dream with my ex. I didn't mention it to Catherine. It's moments like these that made me think I don't really have anyone besides her. I do, but, it's not the same.

It was a sure thing that Catherine would come with me to the city. We were even looking for rooms to share or a flat. Then her doubts came back. Now it's a limbo. I am both hopeful and grieving. I both miss her and resent her.

A couple of dates ago we kissed and I could feel the passion and emotion behind her lips. It was as if my movements controlled her inner feelings. I felt a master of her desire. And just then at the moment of that realization I stopped. How could she be kissing me when in a couple of days we will part ways and stay separated because of her choice?

Now I know for sure that the father of my ex knows about me.

I was outside the woman's bathroom in the faculty watching the purse and bags of Paola when I saw the Dr Gonzales walking down the stairs. Who saw whom first? One smiled and the other waved. He approached me with a confession that he did not recognize me. He asked how I've been doing. By then I already knew that I got accepted to the master in neurobiology.

I purposefully told him to give my regards to her family. Weeks later I saw him again in the conference of the research I participated with in COLEF.

In the dream I had with her daughter, I was friends with her. Again the same idea of knowing that after nothing we had come back to peace. I knew it was a dream. I knew it was not real. I had all the intention of using every minute of it. It's not the first. Am I worried that it won't be the last?

Today I got into my mother's bedroom and saw her ipad on her bed. I grabbed it and opened it. I logged into her facebook and saw the ex's profile. I looked through her last updates and pictures. What she has been up to. She can know about me seeing my mother's posts. Does she?

I finished and had this weird melancholy accompanying me for the rest of the day. She seems happy with her partner. For an instant I thought about writing how I am happy for her, but I decided against it. Is not that I don't feel it, but, why should it care?

I long for a friendship that may have never really been. I saw my reflection in the mirror after logging out.

In less than I week I'l be leaving this town for good. Wednesday. Wednesday I'll leave for the rest of the year.

Am I scared? I am numb.

Exhausted.

## 2017-06-16

Sometime happened today that I never would had imagined.

I had the alarm clock but postponed it several times due to tiredness. Catherine would come pick me up around 2 in the afternoon. It was half an hour before noon. The shorts and underwear were all set up in my desk just for taking them and carrying with me to the bathroom.

Yesterday the plan was set. Catherine would come pick us up with her dog and we'd buy something on the way to the beach. Maybe a pizza and a six-pack of beer. The fantasy and memory of me running through the sand with Nymeria was something that would never fail to draw a smile on my face.

This would be an inexpensive date before tomorrow's night out. The night was postponed since the week before that I was hit by a stomach flu and nausea. I went upstairs and brushed my teeth. There was nothing weird. I sat on the toilet and noticed a small brown dot in the bottoms of my underpants. I was disgusted so I took them off and put them away. I ran the water. The droplets took their time to get hot.

I would wear short shorts today so I shaved my legs just after putting on shampoo. I shaved my pits and chest. I put on conditioner. It was around then that I felt nauseous. Would the symptoms come again? I remember that other time when I had to grab the upper part of the glass door. I was light headed but didn't realize it. Then, in a flash I remember being on the floor and the metalic taste of blood inside my mouth. I passed my finger through my lips and checked the color of it coming out. Because of the mist from the cold water I didn't realized that my vision was blurred.

I shut the water and stood there for a moment. I stepped out and everything was whiten out. Like a blank cloth that covered my view. Million things ran through my head. Could it be an aneurysm? Maybe an ischemic infart or a tumor. The vision came back and the reflection in the mirror was clear.

One of my front teeth and a lateral one were chipped and broken. Then reality hit me. I passed out. I fainted in the shower. I could had died. There was some kind of irritation when I thought it was just the nausea that I would have to cancel our plans again.

I stepped down with still my pajamas and my hair al wet. I didn't even shave. Catherine had send me some messages asking if I was still asleep. I called her but she turned the call off. Maybe she thought it was a mistake. I tried again.

I was crying and my voice shaken with fear. I told her what had happened and that I was scared. Was I alone? Miguel was in his room when I got in the shower. I remember that. I didn't want to say anything. What could he do anyway?

I called my mom with the same fear in my voice and asked her what to do. She told me that there was the option of making an appointment with the dentist. She could pick me up as soon as possible. She took the care to inform my dad.

I was misgendered twice today. First it was him when we were waiting in the dentist office. The other one was the dentist when he finished the work and told his assistant to pass the mirror to me so I could see myself. He asked me what was my name mid session. Maybe it had to do with that as well. He apologized, though.

I asked my mom to bring me back home to shave before going to the doctor. There was a lot of traffic so it was impossible. I ended up buying two packs of jello, a small bottle of water, a sports drink and a two razor pack and did the job on the way.

I didn't want to have to deal with awkward questions.

He checked me. He was really nice. I still don't know if he realized I am trans. I didn't hide it but I didn't tell either. I asked about my medication without saying what they were for. He's a doctor, though. It might have been obvious. He gave me an order for studies and we will go tomorrow morning. He marked Female sex and order for the female one.

Should I had corrected him? Will it cause any problem tomorrow?

## 2018-12-01

Even after a complete day, there is still this aura of anxiety surrounding me. I don't think I completely get what it is about.

Today and yesterday were whole days of completely doing nothing and yet thinking -and worrying- about everything. For this story I would need to go three days before, to Thursday. It was like any other day in the office. Nothing really happened and not much work was done. And yet we were all tired. I was irritated by the message I received from my flatmate. Some woman would come to clean. It would be 250 pesos. She was going to clean the living room and dinning set. She was also going to ask her to do a pass on the kitchen, see, there were some pieces of food both on the counter and the stoves.

I read the message and felt both angry and ashamed. In the morning, when I exited the bathroom, I said hello to whom I thought was Maleny. I wasn't wearing glasses but it didn't took much time before I realized it was a stranger. Some friend of hers preparing breakfast. She answered back and I went into my room.

Maybe the uncleanliness doesn't come from me. But maybe it does and I should feel ashamed.

Everyone mentioned how I seemed uneasy. Stressed, maybe?

By then I didn't know yet if I would do the final exam. Not all of the professors had given their grades. There was a short list of people who got below 8 as their final grade and would need to completely redo their exams in one big long "fuck you" test comprising the whole 20-something modules of the semester.

I could be, for the first time in the master be one of those poor fucks.

I've always been good with both tests and grades. But this isn't high school anymore. I've gotten 0's. Just this semester there were three or four modules I failed.

Anyway. I asked them to go eat. It's the time we go out, relax, chat and drink. It's the time when we mostly drink.

"So, do we take our things with us?", asked Said.

"Aren't we going to return? Because if we won't, I don't think I'll be going", answered back Diego with another question. He is studying to get into the master that I myself am finishing. Both he and Vivi both are trying to get into. The studying guide for the entrance exam was in his laptop. The same laptop that he no longer has with him. That could had been my laptop as wellâ€¦

I was the one who told him we would return. We could leave our things behind. And that was how everything began.

We went to the pizzas and order a bucket of beers to accompany them. That first became a second, then a third... fourth. After the karaoke, and as the hours passed by, both the night and the check came back. It was 1800 pesos in mostly beer. Said paid it when I went outside with Viviana. It was almost 11 when we return to the lab. It wouldn't had been the first time that we returned drunk in the middle of the night for our things. But this time it was different. They didn't opened the main door for us. Then they didn't open the parking lot entrance. Diego and I went to the third and then we were denied.

"Everything is closed. I won't let you in with alcoholic breath".
"...We don't have alcoholic breath" I answered stupidly as if it would had made a difference.

We return defeated. My keys to my apartment were in my backpack. I had no way of getting in. My shitty phone's battery was dead, so even if Maleny weren't fast asleep, I couldn't get a hold of her.

We met Said and he told us Viviana was inside. She went in through the gates. The next day after I woke in Diego's bed with the same clothes I had, I regretted why Said didn't stop her. Nothing was better because of her breaking in; all was worse.

She returned and said she didn't had any keys. I gave her mine. I didn't stop her either.

And so everything went from bad to shittiest.

The guards armed with flashlights corralled her outside the building and escorted her with her arms full of our stuff. She got her bag and their coats. Gave me my laptop with the drive and Diegos' charger. Then handed their bags to them. It was all she found. My keys weren't there. They grabbed both Diego's computer and Viviana's credential. We exchanged angry words, useless requests and finally left. Diego let me stay at his house. He lend me his bed. None of us rested that night.

The next morning our stupid shit turned into real problems. Viviana is banned from the lab until everything clears. The laptop is confiscated until the "investigation" is over. Eduardo talked with her and made no mention of the incident to any of the rest of us. Or at least to my knowledge.

I came back home yesterday and slept most of the afternoon. Diego called me in the afternoon but I ignored his call. Maybe it was something about that. Who knows...

And here I am. Still anxious, still not working.

## 2018-12-04

The first day of the month, I rediscovered this site from a fleeting memory. I recalled those old days when I had this inner will to form habits. Where I actually had them. The responsibility and weight upon me to do things.

I used to try to exercise. I completed almost 200 days of daily writing and entry on this digital journal.

After just one night, I'd forgotten about my starting and then just ignored the urge to continue.

I don't really understand what brought me back tonight. It's almost the end of the year. The conflict that I narrated the last entry hasn't ended. Just yesterday, when I was working in the lab, three or four times I was bathed in the cold feeling of a burst of anxiety.

I exited the office walking towards the bathroom, when Eduardo came out of Jorge's office and asked me if Diego and Said were still in the lab. We had just came back from Le petite cafe. It was Monday, so the menu was vegetarian. I have no problem with no eating meat. But vegetarian usually means an excessive use of cheese or cream. Which was the case in both options, hojaldre with rajas y crema or spinach lasagna. I ended up ordering flautas. None of us asked for beer with our meals. Even after a whole weekend, we're all filled with anguish and guilt. With the uncertainty of what will happen.

I returned from the restroom and the office was empty. I saw the shadow of Diego's back through the glass wall.

When they returned they whispered we were fucked. Just earlier that same day, Diego whispered in the same way that they were going to kick us out.

Eduardo was angry. He asked about me, where I were. They omitted the detail that the situation had already been resolved. There was some sort of confusion. Even yesterday Diego hadn't gotten back his computer. He went to retrieve it with a piece of paper that confirmed that it was his. The only detail that above his name was Jorge's, as he's our superior, and responsible of us.

They told him they would give it to the head of the department. Some woman charged with the clinical divison of the hospital. He would have to wait until the report were sent. Even then, just in the morning, before nothing was officially reported, everyone knew the basics of what happened. All of the guards see us, knowing, whispering.

"The gossip of the girl who broke in" someone said when he entered the government building.

In all this disastrous confusion, be it malignant or unintentional, the message came to both Jorge and Eduardo that the laptop that they, we, tried to retrieved and the guards ended up keeping wasn't Diego's but Jorge's.

That would complicate infinitely the situation. Now it could really be a legal conflict, something that could warrant the kicking of the four of us. Or even more serious. They tried to explain what really happened and, as they later would tell me, finally went to the office to just see that Jorge's computer was sitting just there in the cabinet.

Apparently after that was cleared, Eduardo's mood cleared as well. He mentioned nothing of that to me. He hasn't said anything about the situation to me. Not a word.

I don't know if that makes it better or worse.

Today was a supposedly relaxation day. One of those were nothing really happens nor is done. I have clear set up goals and things that I need to do. That's how I like to work. Even this tasks are things that I enjoy doing. And yet I haven't, and probably won't, started.

My nipple is hurting, almost all of my right breast. There was some yellowish discharge in the inside cup of my sport bra. The pain come and goes. I firstly attributed it to the overdose of hormones caused by the change in my prescription. But I'm not so sure anymore.

I won't do anything, I won't look up the endocrinologist nor make up an appointment with one of those free clinics. The situation just lined up in the worst possible way. He scheduled the yearly check-up of my blood levels after changing my year and a half medications and dosage. Not just that, but I'll leave the country a couple of days after my appointment with him.

I just hope that everything clears up by then, both my health and the situation with the Institute.

## 2018-12-05

"I've returned to the Institute in the same conditions"

Those were the words Jorge confided to Said before Viviana and I returned from eating. I guess everything is OK now. I had the idea that yesterday was when it was going to be the "trial" of Vivi. Diego was supposed to go and give his account of the events. Jorge told him to wait until then to pick up his laptop from Lourdes, the woman who insisted on making it a big issue, bigger than it should had been, as the Dr in charge of the Teaching department told Viviana in her supposedly judgement.

"He defended me more than myself", were her words after returning with a huge grin on her face.

All is set, all is over.

Not just that, when she went into Jorge's office to apologize after Said came out, he told her that there was nothing to apologize for. It was just an incident. He understood. She mentioned something about looking for a job, and he told her that actually there were two openings for positions there in the hospital. She should ask Erik for the information about some justification letter. He was thinking of proposing both her and Alejandra for them. Both are trying to get into the Master I'm finishing.

Was I jealous? It's a common theme of Said and I that we would hate working in the Institute. But then again, I've never in my life have had a job.

The secretary or coordinator or whatever position has the woman who replaced Leonor answered back my e-mail of the letters for my research visit to the NIAAA, stating that there were some errors in the schedule. The objectives and expected results were missing. And also it had to be signed by Eduardo.

What in the hell could I put as expected results? What am I expecting to get from there? It's a sure thing a job won't be. "A better future", answered Said back to me.

There are lots of plans, really achievable plans in my near future. I just rejected a presentation of my project in Vancouver. Eduardo wants me to publish my thesis project in JAMA Psychiatry a 14, something Impact Factor journal. Not only would my first published scientific article would be one where I am first author, but it'd be in a high impact journal. In a couple of weeks I'll submit an abstract for a conference in Rome. There is another paper in the way, with the same potential of being in an important journal and which Said already said that I would, again, be first author.

There is a lot of potential in my future. Most people seem to notice.

Why can't I get a job, then?

Even thinking about a doctorate. Israel told me that it would be reasonable to expect an offer of doing it there in Maryland with Tomasi. With that paper published, is not that far-fetched to think I could get accepted in the program of Bloomington that interests me.

But I can't apply for this year. I'm trapped again in the process of papers and rectifications. I'm not able to graduate until my university certificate returns corrected. Which God knows when that could be.

So, there it is. I'm fucked again by circumstance.

I corrected the schedule and sent it to Eduardo to look over it. He told me to correct the English, there were some mistakes. Which was weird because I actually asked Viviana to proof-read it. He proposed sending it to Sarael and Barrios, as they have more experience in these kind of procedures than him.

Minutes after receiving the e-mail from Nuri, Leonor's replacement, there came another e-mail stating that the next academic committee meeting would take place in the 8th of January. So, any cases had to be turned before the 11th of this year.

So, again, fucked by circumstance.

Tomorrow I'll send the schedule to Dardo whether I hear from Sarael or not. I have that day and the next to receive his answer; Monday for Eduardo to sign it and I can send it then just in time.

Monday is the Datablitz. That lame event -the last lame event- for the Scientific communications class. After finishing with presenting my research in 5 minutes or less, I'm done with this semester and all the classes of the Master.

After next week, I'll be almost done.

And then I will be going to Tijuana. Again.

I hope this time is less catastrophic than the summer.

## 2018-12-06

Another day, almost another week. It's been like a month, maybe just a little less, that I keep counting and thinking about the days left before I can return to my parent's house, my hometown, for the holidays. Now it's less than two weeks. But I've stopped counting.

We were walking, exiting the institute with our stuff and keys. We can be a group of drunk idiots, but we learn from our mistakes. It's just one week after that incident, but as I wrote yesternight, everything seems to have turned out OK. We can laugh now.

We just went to eat wings and then for another couple of drinks in the Salamandra cafe. I'm a little drunk, though I didn't drink as much as last time.

Anyway, Vivi cancelled her appointment with her analyst so she could stay all the afternoon with us. Obviously she didn't state the reason why in her text message. Both Said and I commented that when we were in analysis, we told our therapists everything. They knew everything about us.

Again, topics of conversations surge spontaneously that I think about an anecdote or this piece of information, but a part of me, like a little alarm, makes me be alert of what I could say and how much information I could splurge from my past.

Kill, Marry, Fuck...

When did I learn about that game? It was in college, I think. Paola A introduced it to us and we played. Then, most of the girls married me from all of the classroom. Now it was the other way around. Although it was just the four us, the guys killed each other, said they would fuck me and marry Viviana.

Now that I write it, the logic seems all wrong. The logic I use to feel insecure, I mean.

Then I remember thinking, as a supposedly man, how girls didn't want to fuck, but marry me. I guess it might seem that I was intelligent, nice, or with a potential good future. But I didn't feel attractive...

Now that it's the other way around and I am the women being judged and objectivized by men, saying they would fuck me and marry Viviana, I felt disposable. The least of two evils. Something to be used and thrown. I don't even fancy the idea of being with men. It's just a rationalization, an excuse to validate the idea that I am shit and unattractive and damaged goods.

With the talk of analysis and all of that I remember the times with RenÃ©. I did use to tell him everything. Well, not really. He wasn't the first to know me, the real me. It's weird the sensation, the memory of having the confidence of talking about [almost] any thing, be it a dream or a shameful thought, and compare it with this, each day more common, feeling of hiding my past. This huge part of my identity. Maybe not who I am, but who everyone thought I was...

Dardo sent me back the schedule with his signature. I sent the e-mail in the morning, around 7 am just after waking up, without waiting for Sarael's comments on the document. When I got to the laboratory I forged his signature on the updated one. I mean, he might just delay a little before signing it anyway... It wasn't even half a day and already I assumed the worst.

Now I just will wait until tomorrow for Eduardo to sign it, scan it and send it again.

One week and a half...

With all this talk of analysis, free association and resistance...

Eduardo sent a message a couple of minutes ago, asking if we were going to do a Christmas party "at least have some tamales". Do I even have the time? Most of my next days are filled with stuff to do.

I haven't finished the analysis on the data that I've already analyzed countless times. A month, maybe two ago, I started redacting what would be my first scientific paper. "I want to submit it before December, so they can review it before the holidays" was what Garza said... It's like instead of advancing I'm going backwards.

And just like going backwards, am I avoiding the subject?

It's not like the times before that I had a reason to be excited about going home. I mean, sure, for the last month I've been using this piece-of-shit phone and the replacement is waiting for me there.

But, after all those months of not writing here, those empty boxes filled with stuff that has happened and changed. I haven't mentioned those big changes.

Sure, the master is almost done. I've changed apartments twice already. I have these huge goals and potential successes in my near future. But the people around me is not the same. My therapist, even the fact that I have one, is not the same.

I am not lonely, but sure as shit I do feel like I were...

## 2018-12-07

Eli, the MRI technician asked both Vivi and me if we were going to go out this holidays. I answered back affirmatively, saying that I'd be going back home to Tijuana. We chatted a little about all sorts of things. He asked me if we were going to see each other before our respective holidays. "If not, come look me up to say good bye".

He's a really nice guy, and someone who knows his stuff. Later in the afternoon, in Le petite cafe, we mentioned how he was the complete opposite of Raul, the medical physicist who replaced Edgar. In the time I've been working with the MRI machine, I've lost count of how many physicists have come and gone. Edgar was a bit of an asshole sometimes, but this idiot is a total cunt.

The whole day, from start to finish was a series of really unpleasant events or turnouts.

It started really early, even more than the usual weekdays when I went to class. Even next Monday that I have to get up early, it will be later than the time the alarm clock had to sound in the morning.

I don't remember what I dreamed. Some night this week I had a sexual dream. In my life I haven't had many of those. I don't think I can recall even one who could fulfill the definition of 'wet dream'. There was once, when I was around 5 or 6. Or was it 9 or 10? I was still a kid, and used to have this kind of weird dreams that gave me strange sensations. From this one I woke up with pajamas wet, but the bed was all dry. It wasn't urine. It was something else. But I was way too young to be having wet dreams. I don't know what was it.

Since the hormones, maybe a couple of years before, I feel this weird sensation in my body when I get turned on. It's not just being horny. At first I confused it with being hungry or really really thirsty. Like this urge for... 'something'. I can't really put my finger on what. Or what do I want to do with that thing that my body wants.

In the calendar my next estrogen shot is supposed to be tomorrow. The last one I had it a day late. Tomorrow is Saturday and I really don't want to shower, change and walk like a kilometer for it. I could look up a place Sunday after therapy, but I don't feel like that either.

Have I written about my suspicious of being on an overdosing prescription? The itchiness, soreness and pain on my nipple has subsided. If after my next shot it comes back, I think I might suspend the shot for these months.

But I was talking about all that happened. I got half an hour before eight to the laboratory. The patients were scheduled both at 8pm. An hour passed and neither had arrived. I was downstairs in the hall next to the MRI, when Alan came down to tell Raul that one of the subs got confused and thought that he was scheduled for 9. The other one was stuck in traffic, there was a manifestation nearby.

A couple of minutes later, one of them finally arrived but had non-zero alcoholic levels. They send him back to have some breakfast and return later. Around 10, Thania had her patient, so we would wait until after her to scan ours.

I was just showing Viviana how strict is the journal where Eduardo wants us to publish our results when I remembered the things I read yesterday about how they discourage the publication of the manuscript on preprint servers, that all of the authors have to fill a form stating clearly their contributions to the study, and that one or two named authors had to state that they would take responsibility for the validity of the data and the precision of the analysis.

There was something in that request that made me nervous. What if there was something wrong with my data? What if my whole career came stumbling down for some stupid bug in my code?

Just then I noticed how the levels were different for the same subject in the three analysis I ran, when there were supposed to be no variation. The matrices were read wrong. So all the data was wrong. It wasn't just the TMS project but the metrics I lent to Said to do the Machine learning analysis.

All the work of this past week has been for naught. I have to do it all over again.

It was the afternoon and we were just scanning the subjects scheduled for 8 in the morning. The cherry on the top was how Raul, again, kept treating me as an idiot. Both Viviana and I have prepared patients alone for the running of the sequences. We've been doing this for more than a year. This fucking moron probably hadn't seen a MRI machine before coming here and he has the nerve to treat me as an imbecile.

Even Viviana noticed it.

Monica sent me a message last night after I told her I would go to sleep. She said how she wants for me to have my phone back. There are lots of things she wanted to tell me. Could she sent me a bunch of messages? "I love you", she finished, before telling me to "hold on". I didn't really got that last part.

Around noon, she sent me like 10 screen-captures of her phone with the conversation on whatsapp that she had with Luis, her ex-boyfriend.

I even felt bad for the guy. She put him in his place. Why did he keep sending her memes or starting conversations like nothing had happened after the drama he made asking her to not contact him? What did he expect from her? She was sick of it. She didn't want any of it.

It made me remember October, September, and those messages that seemed to come out of nowhere.

## 2018-12-08

Like all those nights when, after a long week of not having enough sleep, I sleep for more than 10 hours, I had a series of long and weird dreams. By now I think I have forgotten most of them. Is there a point in remembering them?

Again, like all the weekends, I found it hard to get out of bed and start to do the lots of things I had to do.
Most of the afternoon I spent fixing the stupid mistake I discovered yesterday. Tomorrow I have to get up in the actual morning and go to therapy. This will be my last session of the year. Maybe after returning from home, Fausto will tell me to see each other once a month, entering a new stage of maintenance.

Yesterday, in my words, I touched the subject of changes. Having transitioned, the changes in the pictures of my past have more meaning to me than to any other person.

After she showed me the screen-captures from her conversation with her ex, I let the conversation die. I was really tired. I had something for dinner and then went to sleep. This time were more than 14 hours of sleep. I woke up and grabbed the laptop to my bed. My phone is a shitty device for wasting time in Facebook or Twitter, or anywhere else for that matter. I saw I had messages from two conversations, the first one was one from my mother. It were some pictures of the wedding of Edgar and her, I guess, fiancee. The other one was Monica's. Of course reading the pseudo-apology and kind-of-begging of her ex, I couldn't help but remember that although I either look nor am nothing like I was four or whatever years ago, I still am her ex, too. Even though everything seems OK now, the things didn't end too well, either with us. It was years before we even got to talk again. Should I be careful?

"Hello! Gentle reminder that you're such a beautiful woman! Countdown wooo".

I felt a little calmer after reading that. She told me a little about her night before. Later in the morning she asked me if I know how to apply eyeshadow. I told her I did, but didn't felt really confident about it, and almost never used.

She told me to teach her.

Two years ago, maybe, I was in Aidee's room learning how to put on make-up. She asked me how were things with Monica, and if she had seen me as a woman. And here we were now, her asking for my help with those kind of things.

I looked up pictures with eye make up, just so she wouldn't get her expectations too high. I found one from February, when I was in Tijuana for Catherine's birthday. The clothes I wore were really casual, actually. Jeans and a t-shirt, but I did wore make-up. I took a self-picture with my phone in the car to show Catherine how I was dressed. I showed her that.

She really liked how I looked. I found other pictures from a month before, in Tijuana as well, again Catherine and I were sitting in a Brazilian restaurant for my birthday.

It's been almost a year, and I couldn't really tell if I look that different by now.

I am a little thinner, but other than that?

Monday is the last event I have to attend in the university. I have to present my project in 5 minutes, from the introduction to the conclusions, and after that I am free from all the classes and credits. I will send the schedule they rejected for Washington and the only thing left would be the abstract for OHBM and my article.

Edgar is married and has a son.

My uncle no longer lives in their usual home. Maybe a couple of months ago they finally bought a new house. When my mother showed me some pictures it looked in a really bad state. There were lots of things to do before I would consider living in there. Walls, the roof, painting...

A week and a couple of days and I'll leave this city. A month later and I will be leaving the country...

If everything turns out OK, that is. They have to approve my funds. I feel really uneasy writing, talking or even thinking about NIAAA, because of that. What if I end up not going? What if something, anything happens and it's ruined?

Monday morning I'll send that paper and hope that everything turns out fine.


## 2018-12-09

I haven't finished my presentation for tomorrow. I'm doing it, well, it is kind of done, I guess. I just need to enunciate the conclusions, modify the stats data and change fonts and colors. It's gonna be 5 minutes. And I have 15 slides. The rule of thumb in slide timing is to assume a minute for slide. I'll be fucked.

I'm tired, I am a little hungry but I need to finish this. My mates asked us to be there around 8, 8 and a half. I'd need to get up around the same time as Friday. Then again, it is going to be last event or to do in the semester. Maybe in the whole master.

I'll do fine.

I have been working most of the afternoon. I got up around 9 to get ready for my therapy session. A part of me didn't want to go. I didn't really know what to say. I mean, there are things. Yesterday Monica said some nice things and we made some plans. This last two weeks have been really stressing, taking into account my not-yet-done paper and the situation with yardis' pizzas and the guards of the institute at midnight. Catherine's grandma died and I said nothing. Well, I told her nothing. I sent a message to her mother, giving her my condolences. Monica, when I told her, said that was the worst idea.

In this week that I've been coming back to writing my words, I haven't mentioned Catherine once.
Just now, the second time I typed her name, felt a weird, uncomfortable tingling in my back. My fingers clenched and I can't wait to change the subject.

Today was the party of Sofia, the Sofia that went to study a master in Lyon, not the other Sofia that asked me to help her with her class assignment of a research project in which she wanted to study the stories of transgender people.

Of course I didn't go and of course I haven't done what she asked me to. I guess this weekend will be two weeks since she finally sent me the questions after I not-that-kindly blew her off and then accepted out of pity.

One of the homeworks, maybe the last one, that Fausto assigned me was to make a book of stories with the lives of important, be it famous or just important to me, transgender women. I mean, I have been kind of busy. But I guess I do have been putting it off. Why is it that relating to other trans women makes me this uncomfortable? Is it because of their passing compared to my own?

The last one I met, Vania, I didn't noticed at first. There was something in her mannerisms or posture that made me look to other signs, like her feet, hands or even the presence of a bulge in her pants. I hate doing those things, because I hate thinking people do them with me. Was I uncomfortable in the same way with her after she disclosed her history?

Do I feel this way around Paulina? She is the other way around, she is eons ahead of me. She has done, in her own words, all of the surgeries. She looks and acts the part. There are some hints in her comments and way of talking about the subjects of transitioning that remind me of the women I worked with when I was in the group of Ruby. Those women from a different generation, which feel proud in distinguishing themselves from the lesser trans. It's not explicitly, of course. But maybe it's more of my imagination.

I took out some money from the ATM to pay Fausto and then took a bus to his apartment. I got in and it wasn't until halfway that I noticed that it was the wrong one. The destination I take is Pino Suarez, and I recognized TaxqueÃ±a, which is the first station of the subway, one before my drop-off.

I walked like a kilometer, maybe less, to Fausto's. I got 10 minutes late. I rang his electronic doorbell, but he didn's answer. I rang again, and nothing. I sent him a message in whatsapp, and a couple of minutes later I called him. Apologetically he asked me if he didn't cancel me on time. I said no.

We talked about seeing each other next week, but I think I will cancel him. I don't know. I lost almost three hours going there and coming back. And yet again, I think I will lose another one right now eating something for dinner and relaxing a bit.

## 2018-12-10

I was asleep. I was really, really asleep. Maybe even dreaming. From the start of today around 6 in the morning I knew today would not be a day when I would do much work. I would go to the university, give my presentation as a final project and event of the classes in the master and be done with this. Then my day would I end, I would be able to rest.

I finished the slides around one in the morning. Maybe 1:30. I brought them down to 15, and practiced the presentation lasting around 6 or 7 minutes. That was enough. I went to sleep my good-earned 4 hours.

The morning was cold and unforgiving. I shower fearing having another black-out again. It was one of the last entries, I guess. Before entering into the master I wrote how I fainted showering in Tijuana and was really scared about it. It has happened twice again since then. The second one was around September, or was it October? And the last one a couple of weeks ago. None of them made me really fell, but I did lose consciousness for a bit. Is that feeling close to how it feels to die?

Diana asked us to be in the university early, around 8pm to get things ready. That's almost an hour earlier than when we usually got there for classes. I underestimated my morning time and got there around 7:45. I bought a latte and waited for people to arrive. I was nervous. I don't know if it was because it would be a graded presentation or because it would be the last one marking an end of a period.

Everything went well. People showed up. The presentations were fine. I was up last and think I did a good job.

When everyone started leaving we talked about doing something. They said going to Xochimilco's trajineras. At first I took it as those empty plans that get build over thin air. But after a while it got serious. We ended setting for going to eat wings, like, was it last semester?

The agreed date was the one when Eduardo set the Christmas party for the laboratory. I haven't decided if I won't go to that. I guess I'd prefer going to the one with my classmates, but I'm not really sure.

A couple of days ago I sent Paola a message asking how she was. She didn't answer. Today Jessica sent me a message in Facebook asking me if she had already told me that I would be Rafa's secret santa. Surprised I asked her if wasn't I Jose's secret santa. I didn't tell her that I already asked for his present to be bought. Though it was the first thing she asked. "The thing is Jose is no longer going to the party".

Well, duh...

I thought it was weird that he'd go. Maybe the thing that happened wasn't so serious. Maybe he was closer to us in some way. Of course not. Not much later I fell asleep.

I went to the pharmacy after the presentations to get my hormones shot. It hurt again. I don't know if it's the medicine that make it sting or the way the dr applies them. I haven't felt any of those side effects of last time. Maybe in a couple of days.

When I woke up Paola sent a message in the group of the gang asking if someone wanted to see the grinch on Sunday. Catherine answered, asking for a time... "She was going to go to mass"

One week. One week and I will be home. Will I really rest? I have lots of things to do. The article has to continue.

Said sent a message to Telegram saying he ran the corrected data again that I sent to Telegram and, again, the prediction was perfect. Either there is something wrong with the data and the way I extracted t he graphs, or we are onto something big. They think is the latter, I wish for the former.

Alan send me the last database with the clinical data for all the patients until the 32. I can technically continue with all the analyses, but even though I slept most of the afternoon, I'm tired.

Tomorrow I won't go to the lab. I'll stay home and hopefully continue with the work. Wednesday I want to tell Garza I'll be going home. Thursday I have a meeting in Copred, Friday will be either the thing with the lab or with my classmates, Saturday is the Yaaj's Christmas party and Sunday a meeting there. I will cancel the appointment with Fausto. And finally Monday is the day were I clean my room and make my bags.

## 2018-12-11

Well, I guess I did plan it. Today would be one of those days. Did I say that I'd do nothing, or that Monday I'd do nothing and work all of the pending tasks today?

I did nothing more than eat and sleep. I woke up in the afternoon. The night before I did some reading on the statistics book. I read those chapters and learn about this robusts methods that could really work on my data and think about implementing them. I slept in the afternoon yesterday. After coming back from the university I lied down and got up in the early night.

Even though I got up around an hour or two after noon, I ate, watched some series on netflix and then went straight to bed again. I did start feeling a little stinging on my right nipple again, but I would not blame my lack of energy on my hormones issues. Maybe it's just that time of the year. Last year when did I went home? No, not by now. I go three weeks. It would be the same as this year.

Both Chevo and Jessica answered back my messages. Jessica finally sent me a screencap of what Rafa had asked for the secret santa thingie. She apologized and told me that didn't have her phone. Apparently the rice method did work for hers and it was fine now. Yesterday I tried turning on mine again but nothing happened. I don't know if taking it with me to Tijuana and disposing it there or just throw it right now on the trash.

I haven't finished the bottle of coffee liquor that I bought on my trip to Queretaro with Paola. It's maybe just a shot left.

Is the time before a trip when I start calculating how much food is left and how much more should I buy so it exactly finished by the time I leave. One week. 6 days and 7 nights. I laid out the plans for each day in yesterday's entry.

Last night when I was lying in bed I started to worry about the OHBM abstract. I have too much different results how the fuck will I be able to present them in a poster. Will I have them finished by next week? I should finish all of it by now.

Eduardo hasn't told me anything yet. He wanted us to send the paper by last week. I still have much left to do, to finish and to write.

And I've never felt more tired in my life than now.

At least school is over.

I mentioned to Monica how I was practically done with the master. She congratulated me and said it was a big deal and something to celebrate. I did have this feeling that this time that I went to Tijuana would be like the last one, time would pass and we would not see each other. But, there are certain things or comments, like that one about asking me to help her with the make up. Or some months ago how she would take me to this restaurant because of something and that time that said we had to go out dancing. I guess by then I didn't know yet she actually knows how to dance while I just make a fool out of myself.

She told me yesterday she was sick. She had to leave the office. The night before she had gone out dancing with her class friends and met with Ivan Rupit there. She uploaded some pictures to IG. She had mascara on in them. I mentioned how she was wearing it and looked fine. She answered me back today that I didn't know that she had to clean her face 10 times before it looked OK.

Don't all women do that?

Will I wear make up for one of the things in this week?

I guess the one that excites me more than anyone is the thing with my class mates. I would be really disappointed for it not to be actually done. I read about the christmas party at Eduardo's and now that they mentioned about doing this elephant gift exchange I feel more and more OK about not going.

It'd be nice hanging out with the time, but the people I actually care about from them I hang out with like at least once a week outside the lab.

I guess this week we won't do it.

I have a thing for every day of the week except the last one before the trip and tomorrow.

And yet again, I could not be more tired

## 2018-12-12

At least today I did wake up early, not around 6, but I was out of bed before 8:30. That might not sound like a lot, but compared to Tuesday that my day began around 2 hours in the afternoon, it is something.

I hesitated about buying something for breakfast and ended up getting a cup of cheap coffee and some pastries in the convenience store near the office. I thought around 10:30 would be a good time so the lab would be empty. I was way wrong. I got there and it was full. Diego and Said sharing his desk, Eduardo doing something in his, and some guy in the one with the available monitor. Was he using it? No, he was working on his laptop.

Just now, my laptop froze and, again, I feared that most of my work was done and erased with my shitty hard-drive.

Everything seems OK, but there is a weird red signal next to the names of the partitions. I just see that it says that the symbol means it's not OK to remove the drive. Some program might be using it.
Who knows. Getting home I will get my other drive and use it as some sort of back-up. I could buy one, but I don't have enough money.

I've been expending it carelessly. Most of my plans now I consider them thinking about how much money they will cost me. I went to the supermarket and bought exactly what I might need for this week. We went to Le petite to eat.

The lab was full and it was hot in there. Said and Diego were going out for a walk and I asked if I could join them. When we were going out, we saw Mercadillo. He made some small-talk with us before entering to see Eduardo. Said had asked Eduardo if he wanted something from the store and first he said no, but then, when the boys were outside, he stopped me and asked me for some Halls.

We returned and both of them were going out. Apparently they were going to the cafe. Maybe they would share a cup of coffee for their talk. We didn't do much in the lab before going out again.

When I first got there, Eduardo asked me how were things going.

Just yesterday I was really anxious and irritated. Mostly with the psychiatrists and residents that have shit for databases. There was a mistake in the sex of a subject. It wouldn't mean much, except for the fact I had just paired the subs with their respective healthy controls. And now that the number of sex was mismatch I had to fix that and run the comparisons of groups again.

I sent a message to the group of the Christmas party asking if they had already set an amount of money for the cooperation of the food. I already knew we haven't. But it was a starting point to say that I would not eat Lasagna with them but I could cooperate with the rest of the things. In my mind it was perfectly clear that whoever would buy the stuff, they would not just buy the main dish. There would also be sides, disposables, napkins and cups, maybe some chips.

The first one to answer was Catherine. She replied how They hadn't talked about money, and that we always take our own drinks. Maybe it was my own place of mind, but I read it as dismissing and unhelpful. Not much later Paola S replied too saying mostly the same thing but in a little different tone.

Later I would tell Chevo that, hadn't I calmed a little, I would had started arguing and making a whole scene.

The conversation kept going and everything flowed alright. Paola said something about the list of things to buy, and what side dishes they had talked about. Without thinking I sent a screen-capture of the conversation. There were the comments that Jessica, Christian and Catherine had made. Except that Christian and Catherine's names were grayed out next to their phone numbers, meaning I don't have them in my contact list.

Would she notice and/or care?

Would anyone? Would I, if the situation were the other way around?

Eduardo and Mercadillo ate with us. I ordered a beer with my food. Eduardo made some teasing comments about what happened some weeks ago.

He asked me if I were going to the dinner party in his house. I lied to him saying I had an event with COPRED.



## 2018-12-13

"It's perfect? No, then the data is wrong. The graphs are wrong. There was something you might have done were there was an error"

Diego told me yesterday how Said had said that he might not send anything to OHBM. He would not send the analysis with the data the way it is. The difference is too large. It "can't happen".

I still feel irritated how because of how the data are, that I should had done something wrong. Yesterday Eduardo bounce back some ideas. Diego had asked me if the function that creates the graphs needs to know the groups. I told them that I do input the group assignment but it's just an index. I'm tired of explaining the procedure trying to convince them that I did not make a mistake.

Maybe it was the thresholding, was Eduardo's last comment. The conclusion ended up being that I'd again create the graphs but using an array of thresholds. The huge gap in the variables were because of the enormous difference in the connectivity. The networks of the addicts were way more dense with a bigger number of connections. If they wanted the networks to be the same, an option was to use a proportional thresholding method, forcing the networks to be of the same density. There was a third method, so I proposed using that as well. I felt pressured to finish them so Said could analyze them. I wanted them to turn out fine. I wanted him to submit something. I want all of us to go.

There went most of my day. I finished the whole brain graph and sent it to him. Using all of the thresholds in the consensus method, the results were the same, a perfect classification.

Today he ran them again with the proportional methods. They were not perfect anymore. They were shit. Not much more better than chance. Well, at least the model is no longer perfect and Wrong.

What I was concerned about happened. It turns out the meeting with my classmates is cancelled. Or postponed or I don't know. It seems that what was agreed was that Jessica and Amabile would say what day they could go because they the christmas party of their lab. So, I have no plans for Friday. I cancelled the gathering at Eduardo's because of nothing. I mean, the idea of a gift exchange irritates me, so I guess I prefer having the afternoon for myself.

I do need to finish my own analysis so I can submit my abstract. Viviana told me how Erik, Ruth and Jorge are going to Vancouver for the conference.

I went to the brindis at Copred. It was, nothing special, I guess.

Tomorrow is the last day of the student of Garza here in the city. The guys asked me when was I leaving. They asked me if I was free Monday. We could do something, some kind of farewell gathering. Another opportunity for us to drink.

It felt warm. I haven't felt this appreciated since Tijuana, since before the master. "Ow, Shofs, what are we going to do without you when you leave us next semester?".

Going out from Copred, one of the assembly members that is finishing their period, the one who arrived late, after almost everyone had already left, offered me a ride in her taxi. I declined, saying the subway was really close. She insisted telling me she could get me closer, maybe to a subway station. I accepted.

We ended up in traffic for almost half an hour, maybe a little more. It would had been way faster for me to walk and just take the subway a couple more stations. She finally got me to Etiopia, the subway station close to Yaaj.

I waited another half an hour for the bus and, again, suffered because of the traffic. I wanted to just get home, watch a couple of minutes of a tv series and sleep. Eat something. I cooked the beans with chorizo that I was planning for this week. Half of my burritos are cold in the plate with my soup on the other side.

On the way here, Eduardo sent a message in Telegram, forwarding us what his colleagues in India said about our script. They got some flags and removing some arguments could move on. They asked if the script was new and if not, what were the versions of our OS and FSL. I remembered that I had to change somethings, but I was thinking of the other script, not this one. I'm still here, figuring out what happened. I ran a subject and an error that hadn't appeared, did. I told Eduardo it was because of the newest upgrade of FSL.

Trying to find the window for the chat I mistakenly closed an activity suspending the script and exclaimed in irritation.

Just 4 more days.

But then again, I only have 4 more days to sent the abstract I haven't even started to write.

## 2018-12-14

I might be really sick.

I woke up from the alarm that I postponed yesterday one more hour. I was extremely tired. I thought about postponing it another half-hour to get some little more sleep. I finally decided to just don't go to the lab. I would be getting late, the guys would not eat because of the meeting at Eduardo's that I would not go because I had prioritized the other gathering that got cancelled.

I just sent a message stating that I was feeling a little under the weather and I'd see them Monday.

Vivi told me to get better and to remember that Monday would be my farewell party. "We're going to drink", followed up Said.

I tried to fell asleep, but my right nipple was soaring in pain. Every moment in the bed made it worse. It's secreting something that irritates the skin around. Yesterday I found some little blood around the aureola. It is the overdose in estrogen. I guess I could suspend the pills after the injection, or the injection altogether.

I got a message from Maleny asking me to, please, throw the trash away.

I got upset and irritated. I asked her the time the truck came and she said they were always some people who pick it up around the street. I told her finally that today I had not gone to the office because I was sick, so I could walk a little looking for one. She said that in that I should not worry about it.

I went out anyway. I hate this feeling that I am a slob and a horrible person to share a flat with.

Luckily there was this guy just crossing the street. He got closer when he saw I was walking towards him with this gray big thrash bag. His face was weird. I mean, not his face, but his reaction to me. I am wearing black leggings and a couple of t-shirts under a house-hoodie. They are clearly pajamas. I had the hood on, with a pony tail coming out from the side of my head. Did I really look sick, maybe?

I coughed a lot coming back, and I can't take off this tiredness and exhaustion. Just thinking about the OHBM summary, even though is something really easy to do and a thing I have already done other times, makes me want to crawl to bed and wait for time to pass me by.

Yesterday Monica and I chatted a little. We got to the topic of her contraceptive pills. She asked me how long until her breasts would grew. I said that maybe a couple of months. And that got us talking about my transition and second puberty. How it was for me, emotionally, seeing the changes in both my body and life.

"Well, I'd tell you", she replied to something I said of how it was actually easier than I could imagine.

"Since we talk, I haven't seen you as anything but Sofia... I mean, it's weird because we get along great, amazing, but I don't feel as if I were seeing Ivan, it even gets a little familiar, in the sense that you are only Sofia to me ... And I like that, you got to be you."

"Yeah, you're just as cool and fun but I do see different people, even love differently. Even though there is history behind, I love you for being you, and not because of nostalgia of who you were"

I find it, even now, hard to describe how reading that, from her, made me feel.

It's weird, how things change.

I looked up Catherine's twitter. Sometimes I go there as if I could find something of huge meaning. I don't really know what I look for, or what do I expect. Several times I decide I won't do it anymore, there is nothing good that could ever come out of those visits, but time and time again I come back. Maybe a little bit of curiosity mixed with nostalgia and the urge to know about her.

In one of her replies it was a surprised emoji to this post of Anahi's: "I'm not one of those who throw around hints in social networks but I know you are. You are a bitch and not in the good way, k?"

Lots of people could be the recipient of that, and in all that huge number, I could be one of them.

I posted something in my own feed, some lyrics of Sabina that I've been having around my mind lately: "TenÃ­an razÃ³n, mis amantes con eso de que antes, el malo era yo". They were right, my lovers, in that, before, the bad girl was I.

Later, I confessed abut what happened in Paco's party last month when I felt this urge to kiss Pascal, his friend, while we were dancing and feeling each other up. I thought nobody would pay any attention to them, both the first one and the thread of my fluid sexuality. I was wrong.

In the morning I found several notifications, some likes and a retweet. Later in the afternoon, after getting up from bed around 5pm, I read the several replies to my story.

There was a reply from Anahi, but it wasn't about my story, but the thing about my exes.
She put this gif of Tom Hanks giving a thumbs up. Maybe I am the bitch she talked about. Maybe it's because of the screencap of Catherine not being in my contacts, as if it were intentional. Maybe it's because she truly is on her side. Maybe I do am a bitch...





## 2018-12-15

I'm really high right now.

It was Yaaj's Christmas party. After yesterday's day of unsuccessful rest and exhaustion, I didn't really feel like going to the party. Already two plans had been cancelled already and the day before was an awful day.

I don't even feel like typing. The words get tangled before coming out, and the sensations of my fingers touching and pressing the different keys in the computer is a distraction.

I woke up and kept coming back to sleep. I had calculated the time needed so I could get to the party just at the right time, not too early, but not too late either.

I got out of bed and considered eating something. Now that the day is closer, is when the food rations start failing. The pain on my nipple has lessened but it's still uncomfortable. Yesterday I actually felt worried about that. Maybe it is something serious.

I just got ready and put one the clothes I'd picked the night before. I started looking and choosing the clothes I would leave behind home. I need to get rid of things so the moving is easier. I packed the suitcase. Or, at least got the clothes I won't use anymore all set. Now it's just picking the clothes I will wear.

I chose the metrobus. The way is longer but it would be way cheaper. I saw the balance on my credit card. They did charge the interests now that I payed the total due a couple hours after midnight. I need to pay 3.5k by next year.

Everything went fine, I could sit and the bus wasn't that full, until I noticed that the route on the phone marked the final station a couple ones before the one that I knew was the crossing-over one.

I got off but saw no signs marking my destination, so I got on the next bus until the familiar one. I got off and walked to the on of the other line a couple of streets over. The lights were red and I crossed just as the green ones got on. There was a bus just exiting the station. I tried to pay, the machine beeped and I cross the bars to a full stop. I stumbled not knowing what had happened when I tried again. This time they let me through.

I saw the bus opening its doors, so I accelerated my pace. I got to a couple of women just standing outside the door with a confused look on their faces. When I finally passed them, the doors closed just ahead of me.

No big deal, I could take the next one. I am used to waiting for 5 to 10 minutes for a bus or subway wagon, but this time there were no buses announced on the screen to my destination. After 10 minutes, one came with a 15 next to its name. The appearance and disappearance of buses was both stressing and hopeful. I ended up waiting next to half an hour for the bus.

I realized that at the station that my phone had marked me, buses do go to my destination, in a crossing of lines in its own route.

I got almost an hour after the time marked in the invitation. Even then I got early. There were no food and no drinks yet. Most of them I knew, but still don't feel much relation with. Paty, the girl I thought liked me to realizing I was wrong and then liking her myself, was there. Sofia, the other girl, the one who just finished her master was there, too.

Is this kind of parties that made me realize I suck at people. I'm horrible trying to pick up girls. Even just getting to know them is very difficult to me. Sofia asked me about my twitter tale and I told her with a couple of people as audience.

I remember the first time I saw Paty. It was at a party like this one and noticed how she was a little uneasy about me. Her friend kept making her faces when I was around. I remember thinking that resembled the way things worked in jr high. I concluded it was just my imagination, but kept something inside like a seed of doubt.

This time they were flirting. I remember as well, after Aldo's party when I actually thought I liked her, that there was no point anything could come out of it. Why did I feel this kind of disappointment when I noticed?

I smoked some pot. It was some kind of vaper, so the first huff was miscalculated and I coughed for like 15 minutes. Just that one smoke and another short one, got me like this.



## 2018-12-16

I'm finally home. I took out the money for my last rent of this apartment and I carried it with me all day. It had me a little nervous, wallking alone at night from the metrobus station to my home. Everything went well.

It was the meeting for the planning of the events of next year in the association. I postponed the alarm, even though the fucker upstairs started practicing on their piano early in the morning. I dreamed something but even though I know it had my attention part of the morning, I can't recall what it was about.

I showered and picked the clothes for today. I kind of now already what I will wear tomorrow and the day of my flight. Now I only have to pack the suitcase with the clothes I might wear in Tijuana.

When I got out of the shower I read a message from my flatmate asking me how I was doing. She was referring about my sickness of Friday. I felt really nervous. What did she want? The obvious was of course to know when would I leave, both for Christmas and the room. But maybe it was about something else. Maybe she wanted me to do something about cleaning, or maybe to give her some money for toilet paper, or that the kitchen was dirty. I thought about a million things while I finished getting ready.

There was a message in the group of Yaaj that the meeting was postponed an hour. I had more time to myself.
I could have had some breakfast but I wasn't hungry. I knew we would eat at Ivan's from the leftovers of the party of the night before. Apparently I left really early. They carried it on until two in the morning. Of course the meeting was postponed.

I didn't receive no message from Fausto about therapy. Yesterday, Hans, I think is his name, asked me if I gave a class in the faculty. He had seen me there. I remember walking with Said the day of the conference of Franz de Val, and seeing him. Said mentioned how he looked like he admired me. It was really weird hearing that. Why would anyone admire me?

Anyway, on the way to buy beers, he told me how he had therapy the next morning. I remembered he was seeing Fausto, too. I mentioned it casually as if it was some bit of trivial knowledge instead of mentioning that I see him as well.

There were some messages about the Christmas party in Tijuana. Every day closer I feel more and more nervous. Yesterday in my pot trip I kept thinking about and remembering what happened with Catherine. Bits of conversations, the emotions I felt, the emotions I feel and what could happen.

She posted about the prices of the food in Costco. They were talking about buying two packs of lasagna, almost 6 kilos for like 9 people, that's a fucking lot of lasagna. I hesitated about saying anything because I won't even eat it, but at the same time, I won't even eat it.

Paola mentioned that she had some big news and said she would tell at the party or proposed seeing each other before that. It was actually Catherine the one who said going for coffee. I felt excluded thinking that I could not go, until the day was brought up and I remembered that in just two days I'll be in the city.

Wednesday. They all could go to Costco and see/buy the stuff and she could tell them everything. I mentioned that I would already be there by Wednesday. Paola said that we could look at the food together, maybe I could find my dinner. I said nothing about how that would be really uncomfortable and much worse in so many ways. I replied her not to worry about me, and that I already was working on some plans of going for dinner before the party. I thought about inviting Monica, but who am I kidding. I will end up eating alone in my house before leaving.

Jessica would get out of work around 7. The plan was to shop around until then. Chevo later said how he had therapy until 9. I told him I would wait for him. In another conversation I asked him to go to Argana. Like Paola, he hadn't answered back. So, at Costco there would be only four of us, both of Paolas, Catherine and me. What the fuck was I thinking? I thought about asking Paola to do something before, maybe a cup of coffee or going out for a bite. But maybe she will ignore my message, too.

I don't know, at least I could ask her to go to Costco together, but, even though she would completely understand, I don't want to give her the reason of my uneasiness with ending up alone with Catherine before anyone else shows up.

## 2018-12-17

Days kept running out until tonight. Now just one more night of sleep and I can rest in Tijuana for the rest of the year. This year has been the most excruciating experience of my life. Tons and tons of obstacles and difficult events and yet here I am, kind-of-complete and sane.

Today I woke up before the alarm, the familiar sounds of children and a female voice in a microphone screaming orders woke me up. Monday, of course, it was maybe 8 in the morning. I had still half and hour of sleep. I had gone to bed after midnight, a couple of hours after it, in fact, finishing the summary of the results so it would be easier to write the abstract for OHBM. It wasn't.

Even though I slept maybe 5 hours at the most, I wasn't that tired. I could got out of bed before the sound of the alarm. I decided against wearing the clothes I had picked up and instead grabbed this red hoodie that I used to love. I wore the pair of jeans Catherine gave me two years ago. They didn't fit at first. These and the other pair I still have were, maybe, the first pair of women's pants I wore. These started to close and look decent this summer, a couple of weeks before the last time I went to Tijuana. I lost a ton of weight in a similar way that I did years before in high school. I was depressed as shit. I stopped eating intentionally. I like the feeling of famine that came up after a whole day of not eating anything. It was a familiar pain distinct of the emotional one that I was not yet accustomed to.

I looked great, though. People noticed how I lost weight and complimented me left and right. I even received messages from people in Tijuana, like Jessica M. who noticed how I looked amazing. It's funny how sickness and misery look good for some people.

Since then I have stopped wearing lots of clothes. I almost changed my wardrobe completely that summer I was there. Ironically the garment that fitted the best was the one of the oldest ones I had.

Plans keep lining up after my arrival tomorrow's afternoon. I have the party this Saturday's night, then yesterday or the day before, came up the Wednesday's meeting at Costco that I stupidly offered myself to. Chevo answered back my message inviting him to Argana's cafe. He asked me when I arrive and suggested Thursday. So I have only Friday left empty. I need to go to the United States. I could ask my mom to accompany me, but I might as well just go by myself.

It might be nice exploring San Diego on my own. I have almost two years living in this huge city of my own, and yet just thinking of crossing the border and wandering around downtown makes me nervous. I've grown so accustomed to do that with certain company that just thinking of doing it without feels foreign.

Most of the day at the lab I spent working on the abstract. I haven't finished. I might not finish it tonight, although I ought to.

I need Eduardo to review it and correct it before I can send it. And even after that I have to share it with Said so he can take the information he needs for his own. We can still do it, but now it does look like a stretch.

Eduardo told me to apply for the symposium. He said that if it scared me he could give it himself. Does it scare me? I told Eusebio like it was the most terrifying thing in the world, but, is it really?

It's not any presentation or conference. I've given conferences and talks to important people before. Once to a group of judges I was introduced as the expert and had to defend myself. This is different, though. These are going to be people way more expert and knowledgeable than me. I'm nobody. I'm barely shaping myself. I haven't published anything, this is my first research project and Eduardo wants me to publish it in this huge journal.

It won't be done this year. I can rest now. Not now, not yet. I still have to finish these words and continue working on my last to-do of the year. This last issue pending, just one more sleepless night and I can worry again about stuff and people that don't really matter.


## 2018-12-19

Let's see how it is to write the words in my phone. Yesterday I had to use the old custom of copying and pasting lots of the same word over and over until completing the limit just so I could continue with the streak of days. I mean, sure, what's the point of keeping a streak if it will also count cheating? I did it lots of times years ago when I used to care about this. I am barely starting again and missing because of something out of my hands would be a disappointment.

These past few weeks I was so excited and anxious to come home. And now that I am here, it's... Empty.

If it weren't because of Anahi's tweet about indirect messages in social media, I would had posted something like: I just exited one of the most polluted city in the world to come to one impregnated with the fog of your memories.

Yeah, corny as fuck, just like I like it.

I didn't, tho...

I ordered an Uber to the airport that costed about twice as much of what I expected.

I left the apartment later than I had planned, nonetheless the timing was OK.

I finished almost all of my perishable food. My suitcase let me brought much of the clothes I don't plan on wearing anymore. Eduardo made some corrections that brought the characters number, again, over the limit. And he also asked me to calculate the correlations with the clinical data on the other stages of the study, and to add the significance values of the analyses. I planned of doing it on the airport, maybe if it'd take me too much, finish it on the plane. When I'd get home, I could upload it, Eduardo check it again, and today send it without issue.

I neither could finish it on the airplane nor uploaded. My laptop's battery died an hour before landing. I worried that Miguel would end up picking me and not going to my mum's dinner.

I was wearing this dress and heels and makeup. I felt pretty, and yet again, like that last time, a woman referred to me as young man when she and her companion tried to cut off in line. Just that morning I had thought how being misgendered when being specifically femme hurt the most.

I told Monica before take off, and that made it a little easier.

My mum was the one who picked me up, Miguel and grandma were with her. From the airport we would go straight to the restaurant. The place didn't had parking, so I said that I was worried about leaving all of my stuff in the car. I drove home with Miguel to leave it and then come back. I thought I could grab this phone and set it up. I didn't know where it was and didn't had that much time to look for it. I didn't even plugged the laptop.

We returned to the restaurant. And just as we arrived lots of people welcomed us and greeted me with that deadname and calling me son. I felt like Jon Snow being stabbed on the chest over and over. I was wearing a dress, tights and heels. I was wearing make-up. Nothing mattered.

I was excited for that dinner.

Surprisingly, I talked with Miguel and the conversation flowed amazingly. We stayed until the very end, the closing time of the restaurant, a couple of minutes past midnight. It was two hours later for me, as I'm still on Mexico city's hours. I asked Miguel to let me use his iPhone for a couple of minutes and cheated.

We got home and I finished the abstract. I cried a little out of frustration but finished it alright around 3 in the morning. I sent a telegram message to Eduardo and went to bed. I slept maybe 3 or 4 hours at most. I wanted to take the clothes out but felt this huge uneasiness being in my own room all cluttered and dirty. I ended up passing most of the morning throwing stuff away and cleaning the bookshelfs.

I did sent an audio to Paola asking her to meet us before the seeing the other girls. That's why I'm here, parked in plaza Rio waiting half an hour until someone send a message saying they are there. She did answer and told me she would call me. She didn't.

It's OK. Paola S just messaged asking that someone tells her when they'd go. Paola offered her to pick her up. Catherine replied that she's really tired and won't come. Someone could send her later the amount of money and she'd deposit it. I read it and felt relief.

I guess I won't see her until the party.





## 2018-12-20

This past night I did sleep. I didn't went to bed that late. I was really tired even when they kicked us out of Carl's jr because they were closing. That was half and hour after 10. I got home maybe by eleven. I felt this huge bitter pain in my heart and even now almost 24 hours later I can pinpoint exactly the source of that sadness.

After typing the words in my phone before going to Costco, I waited not much sitting near the tables of the soda fountain. Paola Sanchez was the first one to come. We chatted a little about her master program and my finishing mine. Does it look like I'm bragging when I tell about my master? I had thought of making no mention of my going to Maryland or Rome and yet I talked about both yesterday.

"And you, Sofi, what about you?" Asked Jessica inquiring about my romantic situation. The closest contact I've had with another person was that party I danced with and caressed that canadian stranger. "I have no time for that, I'm engaged to science now, I guess" I joke trying to escape the question. I told her and them how I just had sent the abstract for OHBM and was waiting for the funds for my couple of months in US.

She make a comment like she was impressed. It wasn't that I felt it fake or anything. I just felt this huge emptiness inside.

Paola made no mention of her news until we changed places from the Starbucks to the Carl's Jr. After shopping around for the food I will not eat, we went to meet with Jessica in Galerias. She was waiting for us in the coffee shop. Paola sent me an audio of Diego saying he missed me and wanted me to be in the car with them.

It was just then when I thought about Catherine again, if she were reading the messages or thinking about us.

I realize just now that the cheating I did a couple of days ago in the dinner with my mom, not all words were saved. So, yeah, my cheating was fruitless.

I had already forgotten the real reason we had gathered until the food arrived and they inquired about it.
I had told my mom I suspected that Paola would tell us that she and Jose were a thing again. Maybe she had forgiven him, I don't know... It wasn't that. She has someone new. Oscar is his name. She sent a message today to the group about therapy and mentioned that Oscar had his process. Catherine about who he was, but a typo instead said that she wanted one. They joked about the mistake. "Why, you didn't come to the gossip", Paola said playfully. Maybe she has forgiven Catherine. Maybe she never really cared. Maybe it's me now the one who she's not OK with... She, again, said we could look for my dinner. Maybe we could find something just for me. Again I told her thanks, but no thanks. Perhaps I am just taking things way too seriously.

We chatted and I was extra sensitive to the plural masculine. These days have been very difficult in that regard. It might have something to do with my blues.

Chevo would com meet us by nine. We kept taking turns playing with Diego and joining back in the conversation. Apparently this guy is really serious with Paola. She might have her chance now to being in a real relationship.

There were some parallels with my own story. She went out with him before breaking up with Jose. No, it's not the same. We did break up. Just I didn't let her go, not really. It's my own issues with possessiveness and attachment. Just like I couldn't really stop wanting Monica, I took it the whole other way with Catherine but with resentment instead.

I was sad hearing her news. It's not that I really cared about Jose. Maybe I empathized with him? No. I felt envious of her. Catherine had Carlos and she has this person. I am, and probably will keep being alone.

I keep meeting new people but none of them would see me. No, now people see me. They just don't want me. Not in that way. How could they? Why would they?

I have lots of things to do anyway. Lots of plans. I have not time to feel lonely. I'll keep being busy, instead.

## 2018-12-21

I feel tired. Not like those last times in Mexico city, when I felt this huge load on my back and shoulders and just wanted to lie down, close my eyes and let time pass over me like a river. This is different. There is an uneasiness with it.

I got up real early, around 7 in the morning. I entered my parents room for a towel even before my dad woke up. Nobody were up yet. They seemed like they didn't even planned to. I thought my dad would go to work today like every other weekday. That was the reason I asked my mom if she could give me a lift to the border or if she wanted to go as well.

I secretly hoped for the latter. That way I would not have to buy the stupid present of the exchange myself. I already paid the 40 dollars for the abstract. I don't have that much money left. And I still needed to buy some clothes. I have this fantasy that I am independent and self-sufficient but I am not. The money I receive is not enough. Nobody offers me jobs like the courses to Said or even the Institute position for Viviana. What's the point of Rome, or going to NIH if none of those things will help me find a job.

I'll still need to wait until my university degree comes with my real name on it. That might take months, maybe even a year.

When Harry meets Sally is on the TV as background noise.

I needed to buy the fucking specific sweatshirt and look for a christmas sweater to wear to the party. They didn't care to mention me that they had planned it that way. Although it is my fault for not letting them know that I wanted to go in the first place. By now, most of them sure be aware of my real intentions of not telling.

I was a little irritated when, after being told yesterday that we'd be leaving around 8 in the morning, by 9 am nobody seemed even close to being ready.

My grandma crossed by feet with me. There were a lot more people in lane than when I used to cross alone. We waited maybe half an hour. We broke fast in Denny's. I was wearing the sweatshirt my grandma fixed this week. I wore make-up. Nobody here seems to care. I am almost sure the waitress called me 'son', too. Everyone keeps doing it. Is it because of how I look? Is it because of me?

First I bought a hard drive, so the one where I keep all the data of my master don't die on me. We got the nto Wal-mart so I could start looking for a stupid sweater with a phrase of a first dad or one of baseball. Of course I found nothing.

My mother said they had gone to this store with cheap clothes. We could go there to look for underwear and pants. I bought pants but no underwear. Two pairs and a long sweater that looks like a dress, or a dress that looks like a sweater. At first I thought I could wear it for tomorrow, but then realized it actually is pretty to waste it like that.

Fuck it, I could later see what to wear. We went to, other places, I guess.

In target I didn't found the stupid sweater at first and freaked out a little. Then realize nothing really matters and I could take whatever. I bought a white blouse, another sweater, a pair of tights, leggings, a packet of panties and two bras. Finally when I returned looking for whatever, I found the sports section. There was one of baseball, but that shit costed almost 50 dollars. I grabbed it anyway. My parents didn't notice and I feel a little guilty. The fucker who grabbed my name in the match will probably get me some shit of 10 dollars.

I saw a tamagotchi in Game stop, like the ones I used to play with when I was a child. In the car I mentioned my frustration with the sweaters to my family and both Miguel and mum told me they had sweated they could lend me. I could wear Miguel's grumpy cats one with the leggings I bought. Back home, Luis told me he had one of Pikachu. I could wear that one instead with my leather jacket over. That one is fitter. I don't know in which one I look better.

I don't know if I want to go.

Paola called me when we were in Target. I noticed the messages in the group where she asked if anyone knew where Catherine works. I didn't relate at first those two bits of information. I returned the call and she asked me. "Sofi, I didn't want to end up asking you". But she did. And I answered.

I asked her later if she had contacted her. She did. I asked then if she wanted me/us to come early to help her set up. She didn't say no, but ended up giving me the same time we had agreed at Carl's jr.

Maybe this is the last sign that I should let things die.

Let's see what happens tomorrow.

## 2018-12-22

Maybe I should start writing the words now that it's early. I won't be around the computer all night. I should get them out and forget about them until tomorrow. I had weird dreams last night. The first one I was in some kind of school or class. We played the game I've been playing with Luis in their Switch. Smash bros. When I was a child I used to play it with Edgar. Maybe that's way the second, creepiest dream was about him, too. It was the Nintendo 64. I was maybe in the first years of elementary school. It was the same time that I used to play with the tamagotchis.

I hesitated about buying one yesterday. I didn't. Why would I need to play with a pocket electronic pet when I can clean, play and sleep with my own dog?

I did ask L to borrow their Christmas sweater. It's going to be cold in the night. I might need to wear something over it. I might feel more comfortable with better fitting clothes. My mum mentioned how my chest looked bigger in that one. I still feel nervous about seeing them.

I let it all out, my worries and frustrations about the party and my so called friends. I did feel better after talking it out, but I could not shook out the feeling that I were betraying them.

I let the computer ran the copying of my data from the old external drive to the new one. It hasn't finished yet after the whole night of nightmares.

In my dream I remember longing to see Monica. We had plans, maybe, or I wanted to make them. Perhaps it was like the plans with my classmates that they never really materialized. The second dream was different. I was in some kind of bus, like the one I take to go to the lab. I got into this kind of argument or fight with a passenger. He was kicked out of the bus, but later returned. I got off before that and ran away. I did look like a women. I hate that issue with my dreams, where it's not constant the gender in which I appear in them. If it's hard enough to deal with the sensation of living in different realities, doing that in even different bodies and beings it's way worse.

After fleeing from that guy who literally battered me, I got into this kind of party. The details are fuzzy. It turn into some kind of sleep-over. I guess I did looked-like and was a woman. But, then again, the line of girls started to do this kind of human-centipede joke smelling their own farts. It was the strangest-kind-of-funny and disgusting thing I've dreamed. I was not a part of that concoction. Andrea was pregnant and I feared something way more disgusting would happen. Nothing did, tho. She just left and then went missing.

It turned into some kind of mystery, and drama. Other people went missing. The dream concluded in my finding this videotapes of Edgar having gay sex with someone. It wasn't rape. Maybe it's my homophobic parts of my unconsciousness that parallels two men having sex with rape. Or at least being something shameful. Shameful enough to kill?

I might need to work in those unworked issues of my mind.

My dad went to buy breakfast. I came back to the computer to see if the work were done. It wasn't.

There was a notification in my phone from whatsapp. The conversation with Monica continued after the night, so at first I thought it was her. I saw the raw phone number that I've grown to relate with Catherine. At first I thought it was a message directly aimed for me. She was asking if we agreed for a time in the preparation of the party, and if so, which it was. Jessica answered her saying we agreed to arrived half an hour before 8 so we could help Paola.

So it did was the time we all agreed for. I might arrive even later than that. I don't know. I don't know what I'll wear, or how to feel. I could completely stop smoking and yet just to think about tonight I feel this urge to have a smoke to calm my nerves.

I need to eat before going. I guess I have the perfect excuse to arrive late. I did say I would make plans before getting there.

## 2018-12-23

Last night was a complete disaster.

A clusterfuck of bad decisions, terrible events and misery.

It's almost 6 o'clock in the afternoon, my head hurts, My knuckles are bruised and I literally feel like I want to die.

I woke up in my bed with my black bra on the night table. I couldn't find my phone nor my purse. I couldn't recall how I got home. I had told my dad I would send him a message if I wanted him to pick me up early. But I didn't order an Uber. I had this flashes of someone mopping the hall and me sitting with the trash can in front of me. I remembered too telling my mom about my nipple pain.

My hand hurt. I hit something, or worse, someone. I remember joking with Chevo that I would not drink with the girls because I had a penis. I'd never make a joke about that. I went upstairs and asked my parents what had happened and how I had gotten home. They filled some of the blackouts in the timeline. I came to the computer and sent a message to Paola, inquiring about my stuff. Maybe I had left them there.

She filled some of the rest missing events. I hit a wall, because of Catherine. I did throw up. Chevo and Jessica stayed with me for a while before leaving. She called my brother and then contacted my parents to come for me. My mom said that she affirmed that I was fine, but didn't feel comfortable sending me in an Uber.

"She and I went upstairs for a while. She waited until your dad arrived to make sure you were OK, but didn't come close so she would not affect you more". I felt like shit. I remember noticing how she glanced at me sometimes, and I reciprocated with this concealed resentment in my eyes. I feared I had said something to her. Maybe I should had sent her a message apologizing or something. Paola disagreed.

"Rehidrate and rest, instead. Later we see what's up. But yeah, now don't send her anything, wait until you're 100 without hangover, physical or moral."

I looked up Catherine's twitter. There was a post around three in the morning, not much later after my dad picked me up. "Hey, what the fuck?"

Anahi replied her with a gif of Sofia Vergara circling her finger besides her head. She replied back with one of Paul Rudd drinking a cup of coffee and nodding.

I sent a message to Chevo asking what had happened, and then again to Paola, if I had told Catherine anything. "No, with Cathy you never talked, but she noticed"

How the hell would she not?

Nymeria is sick. I feel like shit. I slept the rest of the afternoon and still feel broken inside. I want to cuddle up with my mom and cry.

I've never felt more alone in my life. Monica tried to cheer me up and listened to me for a while. It helped, I guess. But I did hit rock bottom.

It was a disaster. I am a horrible person.

I have this urge to contact her but I don't know what I expect from that. Should I apologize? Will she take it alright? Should I ask her how she is? Do I really want to know that she's fine and I'm the one drowning in my own issues.

Chevo and I went to the Oxxo to buy ping pong balls and cards. We walked the way there and I told him how even with all of my plans I feel anxious and empty inside. I see no meaning in what I'm doing. I see no future.

I told him I felt weird being around Catherine. He made a comment of how it was normal, and he expected it. "And for a reason", or something like that.

She took pictures with them. I felt irritated every time she answered to one of my comments. She uploaded the pictures on Facebook and I am half cutted in one. Everyone is tagged but me. But that is my fault. I am the one who deleted her. I am the one who shut the door and sat behind it to cry because she's gone.

"Sofia, this relationship with that girl is making you toxic, really. What do you see in her? She's disgusting. You are a sophisticated woman, she sells burgers."

"Sofi, because I love you is why I'll tell you this: You're making yourself toxic and you're hurting old friends just like they are hurting you. Don't involve your parents in that, you are a sophisticated woman, you have the higher ground, don't drown."



## 2018-12-24

I feel depressed. I cried while my grandma hugged me in my bed. I kept fantasizing about crawling in bed with my mom and just let it all out. The memories, or at least what I have constructed from the different accounts, keep playing in loops in my head.

I hear those words in her voice over and over "Hey, what the fuck?". I see her, going upstairs with Paola "see? see what I had to deal with? Who in their sane judgement would deal with that?"

I am broken. I am broken goods.

She waited until my dad arrived before leaving. She came no close because I was fucking disaster. There is still smell of vomit in the sweater Miguel lent me. There are spots of orange in the back of the legs of my leggings.

Yesterday I went to bed again around noon. I kept sending different messages to different people to gather whatever information I could. I think I've seen her twitter two dozens times since yesterday. I had this urge of sending her a message, god-knows-why. What the fuck do I expect from that? The voice inside my head tells me is to apologize. She deserves that. How the fuck will I apologize for something I don't even know I did. Maybe I can apologize for being a bitch this half-year. Was I?

I was in the bathroom in Mexico, when I was thinking why didn't I want to talk to her. What could she do, or what was what she didn't, that I I waited for?

I never got an apology. I was hurt, I felt like shit and she never apologized.

I did.

I was shit, too. But I did apologize. Except now. "Hey, what the fuck?"

Was I thinking I hit her when I punched the wall? They were several hits. "You never talked to Catherine, but we heard the punches from outside. We knew you weren't right. Jessica went inside to talk to you"

I kind of remember that. Flashes of that.

I thought it was a dream. Sitting with the can in front of me and seeing people mopping. Catherine wasn't around. She probably was with Paola upstairs. Why did they leave? Was it because of me? Maybe Paola wanted to tell her about Oscar. Maybe Catherine wanted to tell her what an asshole I am.

"She and I went upstairs for a while. She waited until your dad arrive to make sure you were OK, but didn't went close so she would not affect you more".

She broke my heart, intentionally, in Vegas. She wanted to hurt me and knew exactly how to deal the more damage, how to break me. "You don't do that to someone who you used to love", were Paola's words. She never really had to take sides. Why does it hurt, to think she turned?

"I don't think there are bad guys, but every person heals differently from a breakup?"

That night I was the monster. "Hey, what the fuck?"

"The relationship with that girl is making you toxic. I don't know what you see in her, really, she's hideous"

Why does it feel worse to hear that? "She is disgusting". "Ay, Sof...".

And yet I am here, crying because of her words. Because I want to apologize and, after everything that happened, I am not over her. I thought I hadn't forgiven her, but I haven't forgiven myself.

She might be hideous, but she's the only one who has ever loved me. She is only one who has seen me, naked fully, with my scars and my poison and hugged me nonetheless.

But I am toxic. I have issues.

"I don't really know most of what happened the night of the party. I don't know if, what I said or did. I just have this urge to apologize to you. For that night, for everything"

"Hey, what the fuck?"

"You said nothing. You drank too much, but acted weird all night towards me, kept looking at me with hate.

"Hey, what the fuck?"

"I just realized that whatever your problem is, it's not me. Work your issues, deal with them however you like, but don't blame me.

"Hey, what the fuck?"

"I think is best we have no contact anymore. Again and again we are just going to keep hurting each other. You literally punched a wall.

"Hey, what the fuck?"

"Grow up and leave me alone."

"Hey, what the fuck?"

Really, Sof, what the fuck is wrong with you?

## 2018-12-25

I'm in Mexicali. Today and last night have been the worst Christmas in my life. I can't deal with the urges to hide and cry. I don't even get the reason why.

I didn't make that mess. I didn't scream at her nor say anything stupid. I got drunk, black-out-drunk, and puked and punched a wall. I made it completely obvious I have issues. I have a problem. Just a couple of minutes ago ago, I made the utterly stupid decision to share an image about "the memories I will always have of the party" with a bunch of blank squares. I felt the need to add an explanation, telling I still have a moral hungover but maybe if I laugh it will pass sooner. Because I'm the complete idiot that thinks laughing about myself when nobody does, is the reasonable action. And laughing nobody did.

It was the second message I sent that Catherine read almost immediately. "Hey, what the fuck?"

She waited until my dad came to make sure I were fine. Maybe she is worried. Maybe she does expect an apology.

Her question is that, a question
She doesn't understand. She might not get how I can be this damaged, maybe she doesn't get what is wrong with me...

Paola told me not to tell her anything, yet. Monica told me it was an atrocious idea. "Dude, don't. Don't send her anything"

I've seen her Twitter feed a hundred times. Maybe there will be another hint of what happened, of what's going on. Maybe there will be an indirect message towards me.

I absolutely have not moved on. I thought I had. I was completely wrong.

I keep fantasizing about the next gathering. Before my return there might be a meeting for dia de reyes. Again in Paola's.

I have two options, either come like nothing had happened, to pretend again that I'm fine and everything is dandy; or tell everyone (or just a few) that I don't think is a good idea. That it would be better for me not to go.

Both can be fine, both can be disastrous for me, again making a fool out of myself and drowning in my own uncomfortableness.

I sent messages to Paola and Chevo. The last to Paola was saying, again, I wanted to sent her something. She ignored it. Chevo's was asking, begging him to see each outer. I confessed I needed help, somebody.

He did answer at least. He apologized that he's too busy lately. Maybe Thursday a little while, but he'd need to confirm.

"No prob. You tell me"

I sent a message to Fausto. Paola did asked me lastly if I was going to therapy. Maybe she's Catherine's bestie now. They can empathize now about breaking up with their horrible exes. How it was figuring out which was the last unforgivable mistake they would handle.

That could be the reason they went upstairs for a while.

It's not that I feel bad about what happened, it's that I don't know. It's not that I want forgiveness, it's that I want to figure out what they thought and think about me.

I sent Anahi a message wishing her merry Christmas. The last ones we exchanged weren't as dry as I thought. I realized I can't find her in messenger nor Facebook.

She could either had deleted her account, or blocked me.

I don't know.

Catherine is online in Facebook. Almost everyone saw my image and nobody said anything. I should had deleted it. No, I should had never sent it in the first place.

"You didn't say anything to her. But she noticed"

"... Didn't came closer to not affect you more."

I'm a fucking mess.

"I don't believe there is a 'bad guy', but that every person heals differently from a breakup"

She has a boyfriend now, whom she was seeing before breaking up. Catherine probably fucked the chillean the night before she slept with him with her hand on his thigh right next to me.

What hurt me the most was her indifference. "don't you think she cried for you already?" Had told me Anahi. And I didn't believe it. It's been half a year and I ruined my own Christmas fighting the urges to contact her.

Asking what the fuck, waiting to see I were fine, maintaining her distance is not indifference. What hurts me now is that she's the mature one. She's the reasonable one.

I am the drunk that punched a wall and could not see her in the eyes. I am the mess. I am the toxic person everybody congratulates you when you finally leave.

I had different dreams. This happens almost every time that I sleep more than 8 hours and specially when the last or latest nights I didn't sleep enough. In these, I was mostly in schools. First I had a class with Zayra, but it was in my old grade school. I don't remember wearing any kind of uniform, and I do remember explaining to one of the teachers how I was older than most of the alumni: "you see, I had to return to grade school even though I am finishing my master's". I remember a phase where I had a lot of dreams with that theme, were I had to kept returning to classes in grade school or jr high, as if it were a requisite to obtain the certificates.

Now that I think of it, they stopped when my mom picked them up and they were all resolved.

A second one, I was taking a different master. It was another university and the program was completely different as well. We were just in this class of psychotherapy that nobody took serious, and because of that we failed the first assignment. As we returned to the second class, this one had to do with math, I took out my notebook and the professor seemed to have a problem with that. She picked it up from my desk and inspected it as if looking for something. I waited before saying anything, but she continued at the same time she continued giving her class. "It's mine" I said out loud, as if it weren't something completely obvious.

She raised her finger and continued with both of her actions. I stayed in my chair. Sitting, waiting. I don't remember how I looked or what I was wearing. I didn't feel singled out or observed until that very moment. The dreams changed as if someone had zapped the channel.

Again I was in a school. This time I wasn't older or different. I was just another girl in the class. I don't remember wearing a school skirt like the one from my high school. It was a gray skirt, but I don't know if it was loose one, or it fell from a jumper. I remember the worrying that my legs weren't shaved. Nobody seemed to notice. Maybe I was that young.

The context was different. It was a science class, but the movie was old and recorded on a VHS. There were some other things happening around that nobody paid close attention to the film. Even though it looked like we were in the 80's, people kept taking pictures up the skirts of the girls with cellphones. They weren't smartphones, though. They were like those clam-shell phones of my youth. I was one of those girls.

It's weird dealing with the things I didn't have to in my youth. Problems I never got used to, that I don't share with other women.

Something happened that brought up the conflict in the story. I had to deal with moral ambiguity and not knowing what to do. Nothing special. The teacher had brought up that the girls wouldn't receive the same consequences as the boys. Because girls are better behaved, because sexism comes in many different forms.
That is weird, too. Realizing that now I am a girl, now I am a woman. Now when they say "ladies first" they expect me to come forward. When they open the door and stay, they expect me to enter. In all these years, sometimes it keeps taking me unguarded.

What was different this time, was the comments some of the kids made just before the dream ended. They all treated me like any other girl. There weren't any questions or rumors. The pictures weren't because they were intrigued whether I had a vagina or a penis. Everything was normal until the casual comments came up.

"You are a women because you feel like one". They weren't judgmental or cynical, they were just them stating facts. "You were born a boy, but you are a girl." I hate those kind of comments. That kindness that feels a lot like hate. They remind me of what I ain't completely. They are showing me the past I want so desperately to bury and forget.

I woke up. I keep coming and returning from the depressive pit I seem to love to cry in. Monica told me to "Don't want to get close anymore to those fat fucks". She told me the truth like those good-intention-ed people that just state facts. "Why the fuck do you keep begging to those people?" "If Chevo were to look you up, let it come from him; but stop with the others, specially that pair of butterballs... None of those sorry messages, you end up looking worse, they are ignoring you. Get the hint, gurl".


"Yeah, I say all that little group of friends of yours are tired of you. Be it by tricks of that fatso that influenced them or they just feel alien to you. If they stay together, let them. You look bad begging and asking for explanations and insisting. It was your mistake putting yourself in there and make uncomfortable moments, but let it stay there, Sofia, let that people go.

"They are no longer your friends. They stopped being your friends a long time ago"

I feel this sickening temptation to keep sending Anahi a message. The words I kept repeating like a mantra came out of my mouth when I realized she had blocked me not just from facebook, but whatsapp, as well.

"Hey, what the fuck?"

I contained my urges

...mostly.

I did send a message to Jessica. I need to let it out. I ought it to her. I didn't go out with her as I should this summer. She came to the bathroom with me. She sent a message asking if I was alright. She won't be gentle. But I do need to get the fuck out of my self-hating and scorning pit. I will see her tomorrow night. The date I was supposed to see Chevo. He might have said something, they maybe commented how I am not OK. Maybe he will come, too. I don't know if I prefer that.

Friday I'll see Monica. The plan is set. Not all have to be miserable things and sorrows.

Let it just be a horrible year and move one.

## 2018-12-27

I decided to get up early -or never even going to bed- and cross the border with my parents, aunt, and cousin to take him to the airport. I knew I'd be getting memories from almost a year ago when I didn't sleep anything as well, and cross the border around the same time to go to Universal Studios. Almost the same spot in the line, the cold air and the dark skies. They were remnants of what happened and never will again.

Saudade.

We got to the airport and waited, but not as much as the last time we gave them a ride and arrived way too early.

I posted a couple of tweets. These did get attention. The first one was the image I saved of the baby cleaning the tears of an anime women in the television with the caption "My inner child dealing with my adult's existential crises". The other one I posted after we returned and I did sleep most of the morning. In it I stated how sometimes we need to let go toxic people from our lives and forgive them, what I tried to do these last half-year but found really really hard, and how it's even harder to let people whom we ourselves have been toxic and hurtful, forgive ourselves and grow; what I just realized this week is my actual situation.

I was lying in bed, thinking about the same old stuff: "Hey, what the fuck?", when I realized something important. I remembered Vegas and how her response had came at me unexpected like a curve-ball. "Were you talking to your ex?" "I saw unintentionally your phone and saw her name"...

Fuck.

I was texting her again. And Paola, and probably she as well, handled my phone. Of course there is nothing wrong in me texting with my friend, except for the fact that the last message I did send is clearly obvious in the application homepage, which is the nearest app to the thumb after unlocking the phone. The message was "Really, I want to beat up this HondureÃ±a".

"Hey, what the fuck?" indeed.

Its both violent and mildly racist. Who wouldn't be freaked out after reading that after someone hit a fucking wall drunkenly in the bathroom. Panic surged in all of my body. It all fit. 5 minutes before the call to my brother.

I made a mess. Paola came to me and asked me for my phone. They couldn't unlock it so I did it for her/them. She wants to find the contacts and instinctively opens whatsapp. She can't find the back button so she ask Catherine. She looks at the message and returns it. I returned and maybe look for the contact myself. Meanwhile Catherine backs up and tweets her mind. What the fuck?

A couple of minutes later the call is made and of course she does not comes close.

Monica doesn't think is that likely. Maybe she just asked myself to call my brother. Maybe she asked me and Catherine never came close to the device. Maybe they didn't even opened whatsapp in the first place.

All the time I showered I played in loops the possible scenario in my head. This time I could get unstuck fairly easy. What does it matter anyway? Of course I'm a violent idiot. I was black-out drunk in the first place, an idiotic message doesn't change a fucking thing.

Maybe Jess was still around when it happened, maybe it did happen and everybody knows.

"If that had happened someone would have complained to you already"

I will meet with Jess in a couple of hours. I started the words in my laptop but am currently resuming in my phone on the way to the movies with my family.

There was activity in the gang's group. Yesterday Paola posted something about the party, something I clearly don't recall and received several reactions. This noon Paola asked about when they, we, I guess, could gather to cut the king's cake. Catherine was one of the firsts to reply, they agreed on Saturday fifth. The date I had told Jessica to save.

It's a sure thing I won't do anything for my birthday and almost as sure a thing that I won't go to the gathering.

After talking with Jess, if it doesn't get cancelled, of course, I can decide what to do.

I've been rehearsing all day, crying in front of the mirror what I want to say. Even then I find it difficult to order all of my thoughts. Even then I find it difficult to open up.

## 2018-12-28

I, really, don't know what to do now.

It's not even about how I feel. Not anymore at least...

I got to Argana really nervous. I felt incredibly cornered when I went upstairs and saw just an empty table in the very middle. I went outside, but decided not to smoke. Jessica had sent me a message saying she was out and on her way a couple of minutes before when I left the esplanade. I posted a Tweet about the sea at night.

Minutes passed, maybe half an hour after 9, when Eusebio arrived. I started with some of the phrases I rehearsed before. He just saw me worried. "I had told you that it was serious. It was the more intense I've been with you, that I'd not joke about alcohol with you anymore".

That resonates with me more now after what Monica told me.

I told him I'd not go to the King's pie gathering. He agreed like it was an obvious thing.

Jessica got there after her own food. We went inside and I returned to the themes. How I felt, how I dealt with everything and how I was doing now, but specially what I feared.

She just smiled and told me that she has no problems with me. I think things a lot. I do my own interpretations and drown in them. She's not wrong.

"I wish Catherine were here so the both of you could talk about this. It's been a lot of time now, get over it." She gets uncomfortable when I am there, I, when she's there. It's over, we might not be friends anymore, but... I don't remember most of what they say anymore.

I was calmed, though. I slept and rested, or at least for a while. They have the idea that I haven't gotten over her -which is totally true and undeniable after the facts- and that I need closure. I never got it from her. We never really talked after the whole shit. I wanted to talk about what had happened, how I felt and specially what we'd do next. She answered, pissed, asking if I was talking with my ex. Carlos, her chilean friend left and a couple of days later she sent me a message. Then, I was the one pissed. And we haven't really chatted since. And I'm arrested in this continuous state of anger and hurt.

I was really affected by her presence there.

I saw Monica today. I woke up around 8 in the morning. We talked a little. I went right back to sleep. I didn't go to sleep that late. I sent my mum a message around half an hour before midnight saying I was on my way. I waited a couple minutes more in the car before entering. My mum sent me a message asking how it went, if I felt more at eased.

We exchanged messages where I explained her everything, what happened, how I felt, what I thought could had happened and how I felt with that. What Chevo and Jessica thought I needed to do and if I wanted to do it.

Moni had a lot of stuff to talk about. The most important thing was when right before she warned that it would hurt but she wanted to tell me since she knew. It was from two years ago when I sent her her stuff with Chevo and Omar.

Omar told her that he didn't really knew me. I was in a party at his house once. Mostly I was Chevo's friend, that's why he was doing that favor. Chevo had told him that I was their friend, but things were weird lately. They knew trans people before, but after the transition their personalities were the same, but mine was different. I was this outgoing party-goer in a bad way, disastrous way. They were all really uncomfortable around me now, and mostly were just keeping me around to see what I'd do next.

It didn't hurt as much as I thought it would. It is what I feared the most, sure, and exactly what I had thought. Even then, a couple of years ago, when I wasn't alone, Catherine and I asked to meet them to talk exactly about that. Things were... not flowing the same way. Maybe it was about me, maybe it was about the both of us. They denied it and things went the same.

Now, I am alone. And I have nobody to bounce back the information I have. To Catherine I probably am that sick, troubled and broken person, so, really, what's the difference? Maybe she's right. Maybe everybody else was right and should had known it, but forgot it, just like Chevo's reaction with my alcohol issues.


## 2018-12-29

The year is coming to an end. I thought today we would go to the United States. It was the plan. Last time we went before the morning of the airport, I had asked the time of leaving. My mum said we would leave around 8. I was the only one awake at that time. I ended up waiting for everyone to get ready. Again I asked and this time she said it'd be around 10, maybe.

It was way past midnight. I went to bed but found it hard to fall asleep. I kept checking the IG story I uploaded with Monica and the number of followers I had. I was just waiting to see Anahi's face in the list of viewers and her name deleted from the list of contacts. I think I was kind of obsessed with that happening, even though I really don't understand what I would end up getting from that.

A couple of days ago I saw a tweet on Catherine's profile with an exclamation and an upset face. Her personal tweets are vague and non-sensical. It is I who puts meaning into them, echoing the critique that I am swallowed by my own interpretations. A lot of shit came out of a non-directed "hey, what the fuck?" . Last night it was a gif of Regina George stating "whatever, I am getting cheese fries", accompanied by her own "ugh". It could had been about a million different things. Just because of the coincidence of times it does not mean she went into my IG feed and looked at the pictures.

According to my own perspective she would not give a shit even if I posted a video of us fucking.

I'll meet Paola tomorrow. I don't mention any of this, though.

Around four in the morning, there was a notification beep that made me extend my hand. It was a Twitter notification saying that Anahi had followed me back. Probably a misguided thumb when exploring my feed.

People care and look. When we looked at each other phones, I noticed in Monica's she had searched for Catherine's profile. She laughed and told me she wanted to check if she had blocked her. "Well, I guess obviously not because I saw her picture where she tagged Chevo".

Maybe she does look? She didn't when we were something, now that we're not, why would she?

I opened IG out of reflex after the non-news. First, there was her name on the story, and second, my followers were one fewer. I sent her a message even though Monica would not agree. "Why do you keep contacting those lards?"

"I was awaken by the notification of your follow-back in Twitter, but just now I saw that you already deleted/blocked me from everywhere...

"Sorry if I said/did something, I really don't know what happened, but Ok, I guess... I'll stop following you on here and twitter"

She kept writing and deleting. Maybe she didn't expect my messaged, maybe she did and had something prepared.

"Do whatever you want. I don't think we'll be friends. That's why I did it, not just you. Cheers on everything you're doing"

"It's hurtful to read that, specially the male "friends", I hope it was a typo... But I understand."

"Ups, yeah. Don't take everything so personal"

Fuck you, you just blocked me and misgender me, don't tell me it is not fucking personal.

There are two things that I wish I could talk with Catherine.

I keep looking at her Twitter and status on messenger as if I would find something, anything that make any change.

If what Monica told me has a any foundations, there is no use in following Chevo and Jessica's advice. I don't know, I don't know if I should contact her, even less ask her to meet.

When I flirted with the idea I remembered the letter I wrote as a homework. It would fit as closure. Just reading or giving it to her. Saying I am still hurt and resentful, but now understand is mostly about me and that doesn't mean I am not thankful of every thing she did for me. Although I am not sure if we can be friends in the long run, right now I need space and not know anything about her.

Monica shitted on Jessica's words. Bullshit she said in way many more words and phrases. Things happened and they will never ever be undone. Things will never be the same and we should all grow the fuck up.

Maybe she's just bitter, maybe she's way more right than any of us.

## 2018-12-30

I did see Paola. It went even better than with Chevo and Jessica. This time I did believe her.

I had several dreams. I tweeted about them. Two truths, one lie. I made up one about being mugged and wandering lost homeward. The other were true, tho. The first was of me being in the laboratory. Eduardo asked us to do that thing I've just done once where we expose our advancements in less than, one minute?

I had more things to do and felt over-stressed. The lab was different as well. It was the location of my mum's old classroom. A huge hall with desks in the surrounds. We were a lot more, too. Mostly I just worked and felt the anxiety.

The second was about Catherine. In it, I ended up with her in a room and we talked. That was as much as I said in the tweet. I don't remember even what was it that we talked about. We just did, and it went well. Then we were in a car being driven by, my grandma? Anyway, we fucked. I kissed her neck and saw the sensations it woke on her. Even now I fall again in this stupid competition of who wins and loses, thinking that even though I had a sex dream about her, her body was different. Does it really matter she was slimmer in it? I fucked her, I miss her.

She also had a penis. In a really unsettling way I penetrated her penis. Mine was as it used to be, capable to having an erection, and hers was just as mine is right now. Small and undeveloped. I pushed it until it entered. It really was a disturbing image.

Paola told me another thing I didn't know about the party. I wrote about how I joked about having a penis with Chevo. He laughed and then-me was pleased with herself. Now-me is mortified about how I could joke about such thing. Today she said that not only did I joked in a personal matter, I screamed it out-loud.

Oscar, her boyfriend, was making me a drink. Because of fucking course. He knew I was in a bad shape, so he prepared it without almost any alcohol. He was shocked and paralyzed when I screamed. Later he would ask her about it. She explained it to him, how I was Sofia but she knew me in the university under a different name and all that jazz. "She's my friend, she accompanied me to Queretaro, and if you have a problem with her, with that, then you can leave". I was really surprised to hear that. In a good way.

When I told her Anahi had blocked me she wasn't surprised at all. Maybe Catherine had said something, but she made no mention of that. She did say that she already knew about the tweet I had complained about. Catherine had mentioned it in her chat. She didn't agree with that, about exposing the things on social media. How she published everything with Carlos, how she hugged him and stroked his inner leg next to me.

She told me how she felt uncomfortable, how she was stressed about how things were. That the group would have to go out with each of us separately because of it. Paola told her how some of her comments felt, hostile. There was this air of hostility between us, it was palpable.

The should had talked many many more stuff to last all the time between my fall to the drunken dark hole at midnight and three in the morning when Chevo and Jessica finally went to get them because I was still drunk.

Now that I think it, maybe the tweet wasn't about me after all. Maybe Paola told her something she didn't agree with... No, for fuck's sake, I threw up all over myself. It was about me.

Paola told me to talk with Chevo about what Monica told me. I just sent him an audio of 6 minutes with a 20 second introduction video. Now I'll just wait for his answer.

I wrote the draft of the possible message I could send to Catherine. I can't stop thinking about how Paola empathized with me. I told her how I feel unattractive and never really related my trans-ness with her having a child. "Catherine told me, that you should just go out with somebody. I told her, that it's not that easy for us" ...

I don't know. I feel like apologizing, maybe we really ought to talk it out. Maybe, maybe it's better that I wait?

I don't know. I really don't know. Tomorrow is the last day of 2018. Maybe I should send the message and wait that if I receive a bad answer I can just throw it away with all of the shit that happened this year, and move on...



## 2018-12-31

Last night I sent Chevo a video and an audio of 6 minutes were I explained what Monica told me, and asked him what really happened. I'm the video I told him that I wished I could do that in person but I got that information only a day after our meeting.

The night passed and I got no response. It was expected. Before that I opened up about my intentions to Monica. She was approving but hesitant. First, she wanted to know what was my objective, what I expected to get out confronting him.

I explained how, firstly, I needed to know if it really happened. Then I would like an explanation. From that information I could arrive to a conclusion about continuing our friendship or parting ways. She, then, stop approving. If that were my reasons, she said, then there was no point. I had many reasons to stop that toxics relationships. She put an emphasis on the word toxic.

At first I kept trying to explain my reasoning, make her understand, but then I realized she had made her mind. She's had issues with her friendships. She doesn't trust mine. She has a point, tho. They are mostly one-directional. I am the one who, even with Chevo and Paola, reaches out all the time.

Later, when I told her about the message to Anahi, again she was disappointed. I should had let it go. She's right. I do have this pathological need to need to know. I do care what people think about me.

For a transgender person, that is a dangerous attribute.

We continued most of our conversations with audio messages until, in the last one, she told me she would try to sleep.

After sending the message to Chevo, I had this urge to send one to Catherine. I even wrote it in my notes. All night I kept reading it over and over, changing little things, thinking, considering sending it out.

The year is almost ending, I kept repeating to myself. What will I get out of it? Do I even want to make things up and have her as a friend?, I answered back to myself.

A part of my thought about asking her to meet in person. Telling it face to face. Just a little more than a week before I leave town again until who knows when.

My grandma is sitting right next to me in the car, fidgeting with her plastic bag and I worry I will smash my head on the window.

I told my mom about what Paola told me, about how I screamed I had a penis.

I said nothing about my intentions of sending the message.

She went upstairs and I stayed on the couch watching FMA, with my phone on my hands. I had her chat window opened and had pasted the message. She hadn't been online in a while. It was around midnight, I guess when I sent it out. I felt my heart race and my body tremble. I don't know how much time passed before I saw her online.

Was I still in the living room or was I already in bed? She was online for a really long while. At first I wondered if she were typing, but the green words didn't appear. It was just her, online. Was she talking it out with someone? Anahi, perhaps? It was way too late for her to be talking with Carlos. Maybe she was just reading it over and over. Maybe she was waiting until I went offline to type or answer. Maybe she was doing something completely unrelated.

I closed the application and waited to see if her answered would suddenly came. Then I opened it up and her online status would disappear. We kept opening and closing it until almost two in the morning.

In the morning, Jessica sent a message asking if the rest of the group would go to the king's cake. Around the same time I got her answer.

We continued chatting for a while and I kept feeling worse. What was I expecting? In all the awkward messages and replies there was never an apology. There were worries, and explanations, but no apologies apart from mine.

We talked about her mom and my mum. I told her about Anahi and talked a little about that, how she has never bad-mouthed me or asked anyone to stop talking to me.

I finally told her generally about what had happened with Chevo. She said she hoped our next encounters would be lighter and that my decision of going or not to Paola's were not because of her.

And that was it. Another conversation but this time started by me. Do I want to keep talking to her? Why do I feel sadder after all of this?

In the way here, I opened her Twitter. Last night, after getting my message she had retweeted a post about being open this new year, to new friendships, to start anew, to meet with people that missed them. This time she posted a review month by month of this year. From Jan to Oct. Her first long trip, when we went to LA. Her birthday and how she enjoyed it, when I traveled her to spend it with her. The loss of her pet of 13 years, when I wasn't there for here, neither present or in any way. Even though I played a part in the first quarter, there were no mention of me until April, where she stated "I finished my relationship of almost three years".

This bitter mix of nostalgia and guilt came over me. The rest where things I had known about, like her rekindling her friendships or her dancing classes, a whole tweet about her happiest moment in 2018 and my hardest one. The rest were new for me. Like her new dog and her getting closer to her mom.

I hesitated about sending the message because I wasn't sure I wanted to know about her, to have any kind of contact. And now that I did, I feared that chevo and Jessica were right in that I didn't want closure.

I don't know what I want. I don't know why I am this sad.

# 2019

## 2019-01-01

Fausto recommended that I should write in third person. To write myself letters. To my future self.

At first I considered it and thought it was an interesting idea. Now that I am sitting in the computer and typing, I find it stupid and just want to end with this so I could go to bed and sleep. I feel extremely tired. I didn't go to bed that late last night. It was around two in the morning, at most. Again I felt this dark cloud of melancholy surround me. I said no to most of the food. I just wanted to be left alone. I thought of her tweets, her joyful pictures with both Carlos and Anahi. The couple of sentences that involved me, which I was either not mentioned or was the relationship she finished.

She loved me. Now she doesn't. Why does that hurt so much?

Not even I know what I feel. I hated her for most of this year. I don't find her attractive, why do I remember with nostalgia the nights we shared after a long day, when we just took our clothes off and held each other?

What did I want with the message I sent? I huge reaction? This long apology and how she misses me? The hostility between us was palpable, she was not calm, she was not indifferent.

And I keep writing about her. I keep remembering and harming myself with what happened and what was said.

Closure, was the word Eusebio and Jessica used last week. Fuck closure and fuck every one of them.

In a little more than a week I'll leave town again.

I overshared in Twitter. I wasn't completely ignored, but then again, I don't know how I can't be not disappointed if I don't even know what I expect from the fucking things I do.

She updated a picture in one of her social networks. Is her smiling, blowing on some snow from her hands. Maybe she was close. Maybe she and her family drove to the Rumorosa to see the snow.

What the fuck is wrong with me?

For years I couldn't get over Monica, thinking about her what had happened, how I missed her. I have her back as my best friend, I've been chatting with her almost daily. She answers back and even starts sometimes, not like my other so-called-friends. I had what I wanted. I had to lose Catherine for that, though. I pay Catherine as a price. My relationship dissolve because of my lie about talking to her. We stopped being cordial because she saw we did talk. And now I am back to where I was, missing somebody who left and hates me.

I send another message to Eusebio. It's not even two complete days. I told him it was important and to please take the time to hear me. I made a mention about how it was gossip but I wanted to clear it out. Let him know is not just some of my personal issues.

I am tired and sick of all of this. I am angry. I want to scream. At first I think about screaming at them, all of them. But it's me who I am furious at. It's I who makes myself cry and feel like shit. I am my own worst enemy, I am poisoning myself and I can't handle this anymore.

What a fucking great start for the year, isn't it?

I won't see any of them nor Monica anymore. There is just the 5th at Paola's. "That the decision about going or not be not about me", said Catherine. Fuck her.

This year doesn't seem like that big of a change.

What the fuck did I expected? Sure, suddenly just because a number is change in the date, all of my issues and problems will dissolve and everything will be great again and all people will forgive me and look me up.

I kept checking Catherine's conversation as if she would suddenly send me a message about anything. I sure didn't when she reached out those months ago. She didn't when I sent those messages when all of this started.

"I didn't tell my mom, because she would not see you in a good way again. I did not expect all of this to happen."

What the fuck was she expecting? What was I?

Are we really that foolish?

She's moved on. She has her friends, her work, her new dog and all this trips and plans and future.

So do I. Why then can't I move on? Maybe I am the fool.

## 2019-01-02

Last night, when I went to bed, I viewed a video of this analysis of the movie "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". In it, the narrator argued that the hair colors of Clementine in the movie were symbolic of the stage of the relationship of the protagonists. The colors themselves, green, red, orange and blue, represented the four seasons of the year, spring, summer, fall and winter, respectively.

It was something I had never seen before or thought about. The first stage of their relationship, when they first meet, her hair is green, representing the birth of new life, then, when they are deeply in love and he realizes that he doesn't want to continue with the procedure of erasing her, the hair is a vibrant red. As the memories continue and he sees their love and passion fade, the hair turns orange, as the leaves of autumn. Finally, when they break up and she gets him erased from her mind, the color turns a cold blue, like the season where all of nature dies.

It made me think about my own relationship and if it fit this stages as well. The curiosity killed me and I went to Google photos to do a review of the last period before the imminent break up. What could had been a terrible mistake and a long way to self-hate and melancholy, resulted in an exercise of reflection and insight about passed time and the coming of a new future.

I got to the summer, when all went to ruins, the saddest and most painful day of my life to realize that, of course, I had no pictures to remind me of those moments. I had pictures of the day and night before, when I shared that city with Jessica and Eusebio. I went back to the last time I came to Tijuana, the spring break. Her tweet had stated that it was April when she ended our relationship. It was March. It was the last week in March when we went to the vineyards and slept together for the last time, a moment she would later recount as something she "enjoyed at time bu later would feel as a betrayal to herself". But here's the thing, I expected to see theses signs or hints of suffering and the upcoming downfall, but there weren't none. I was smiling, even in pictures of the trip that at the time I hated, I saw us smiling and hugging. We looked like we used to.

I kept going back in time. Her birthday party, my birthday dinner and cake at my house. I got to the previous break-up, or more exactly, the time she went to visit me after it. The pictures of us in the ancient pyramids of Teotihuacan, the trip in the bus, the pictures of us with, again, the same usual smiles and joy that we shared together.

I stopped. I could not really pinpoint the moments of transition between seasons with the pictures, and I realized there was no point. Why would I remember the precise points when her love started to face away, and when the relationship started to die? Why would I stain, again, the smiles and candid moments?

But that wasn't what calmed me and gave that first hint of hope that things will get better. It was that I didn't feel any nostalgia or sorrow because of the idea that none of those moments will come again. I was OK with the idea of us not seeing each other. For a little while, I was OK with not continuing our conversations, with this ending that has come to all of those memories. Instead of envy and jealousy of her trips, or resentment because of the posted pictures with Carlos and Anahi, or hating the idea that she were enjoying life while I wanted mine to end, I felt happy for her.

I am no perfect person, I am not this buddhist sage that has master the ability to dominate her emotions. I woke up coming back to old bad habits and painful thoughts, but I saw a glimpse of light.

I received Eusebio's answer to my audio and video. I sensed this nervousness in his voice, he delayed his answer to my questions with apologies and explanations of why Omar didn't deliver the stuff. He denied ever saying that. He could be lying, of course. But, does it really matter? Monica is right, things won't ever come back to how they used to be. Our friendship might be a lie, but there is no need to make this dramatic exit.

I can just get my support from other people and stop investing in the past and what used to be.

I sent a message to Paola updating her about what happened with both Eusebio and Catherine, finishing with an inquiry about the contact of the neurotics anonymous group she suggested. She answered back fairly quick. She was sure it wasn't something Eusebio might say, and commented how the best was that the interactions between Catherine and I stayed within the group and not vis-a-vis. "Both of you are healing".

She keeps posting more and more tweets that are obviously about me, without that much space of interpretation: "did she deceived you or yo lied to yourself?"; "A person looks so different when you stop seeing them without loving eyes"; "One never stops loving, just starts loving other people". She liked one that I liked myself from her own profile: I didn't close the year with the person I started it; we don't even talk anymore, that's really sad".

I mean, I'm no one to talk about it, I keep looking her up compulsively, seeing where can I fit myself in her updates, fearing the idea of resentment or, worse, forget. Paola might be right. Both of us are healing.

## 2019-01-03

I don't feel like charging my laptop and writing in it. I'm lying on the couch, in the dark living room just two hours shy of midnight. I slept most of the day. Yesterday my aunt and uncle came with my cousins from Mexicali to pick up their son from the airport in San Diego. He went to visit his long distance girlfriend in Portland.

This time I didn't went with them. I stayed unshowered in my pajamas all day. My uncle stayed as well. Even if he wanted to, he can't cross. He doesn't have a visa. I wrote the words when they left. Was it before I glimpsed into the past?

Not long after I remembered this website that uses statistical analysis to classify the gender of the writer of a text. I copied the current entry to satisfy my morbid curiosity. It returned female. I copied some of years before. Not a single one gave a different result. It was a relief. It made me read some of the things I had wrote. The first entry is from 2010. I was in high school, before starting my relationship with Monica, before even imagining the real reason why I felt empty inside.

Then it jumped to 2015. By then I already knew. Didn't know what to do with it, of course, but I knew what was my problem.

I remembered Catherine's present of my 21st birthday. That memorable entry where I lament that I wasn't really a man when I reached adulthood. Seeing our pictures had helped me the day before. Maybe reading about our story, My story, would be beneficial too. And so, I grabbed the journal and started reading it. And it did help.

I relived the story from the beginning of the year when I went to Spain, the whole roller coaster that was coming to terms with my urges of exploring feminity. The first day in the hotel when we shared clothes and I found love and eroticism from a person other than Monica. My trip down guilt when I was at the cross-roads of two different lovers, a path of normality but lies, or my real forbidden desires. I played with both of them. I hurt them both. As I read I realized none of them were wrong in hating me. How could I blame them after what I did to them?

I went to Monterrey, to San Diego, to Catherine's therapist's cobsultory and finally all the way across the word.

My problems with alcohol are nothing new. The journal came to an end just at the middle of the first month there. There were never a period of joy in Spain. It was always filled with stress, anguish and sorrow. It was exciting as fuck, and what I always wanted, but I was lying to myself when I said I didn't always suffered.

I read about the time I chose my name and told Catherine. When I accepted to be referred as a woman and as I started coming out to my loved ones. I continued with the next journal and my trips in Spain. I followed that with the notes I kept registering on my phone by the end of the trip and my return. I never really explicitly wrote about when or why I stopped talking with Catherine.

There is a gap in that semester of denial and the sudden return of my real self. I didn't write that much about the internship in the hospital and making paces with Catherine. I remember a dream she had, how she told me about us sitting in a bench or a park and I had long hair and was wearing this flowy dress. She missed that person. It was then that I confessed that I missed myself, too.

And so I came back down the rabbit hole, and again we were close.

I continued reading the words in this site. 2015, when Monica and I were fading apart again, when I faced my situation considering reality and it was way too much. When we started dealing with showing ourselves to the world, and hiding in man's clothes wasn't something I couldn't keep doing. Since Andrea's party in October and Halloween, I dared to go out more and more as myself. Not doing that stopped being an option.

By now I finished with 2015.

I read about us, our sex, our intimacy. All of the things I am thankful to her.

And, I thing about that stage of my life, everything is different now. I am over that. Those problems doesn't exist anymore. I am in a different point in my life. One where she might doesn't belong anymore. And for the first time, I think I am starting to feel OK with that.

## 2019-01-04

I got to the mid 2016. Almost all yesterday and today I spent reading those entries in my phone. I sometimes changed from Firefox to Google Photos, I looked up the pictures from the day I was reading about. Monica's departure. All of the stress of the things I wanted and had to do. I thought 2018 was the year of stressing tasks, but 2016 wasn't easy either. I don't know how our relationship lasted that long.

2016 started with my double life. A couple of months before I had started going out dressed more and more feminine. First it was just dates with Catherine in leggings, then the leggings turned to make up and even dresses. I went to the movies with Chevo and Jessica and, even though it was midnight, was met by countless people. It became unbearable continuing my life as a man. As people kept seeing me and referring to me as a woman, every time they didn't I was hurt.

The same thing happened with my loved ones who didn't yet know or acted accordingly. I battled with both insecurity and the inability to asked what I wanted. I wanted to make the appointment for the hormones, I wanted to start laser. I battled for months with the urge to tell my dad and the sorrow of not daring to. I brought Catherine down in my own misery, as Monica told me recently when we touched the subject. I wanted the changes to come, I wanted to be where I am right now. No, I couldn't really even imagine my life right now. Every new people that meets me sees me as Sofia. My loved ones treat me as a woman almost all of the time.

I am almost done with the master, I'll spend three months in Maryland doing research, there's a possibility of traveling to Europe again to present my investigation as a first author, as Sofia Fernandez, I have friends and people that care about me. Most of the people I interact with don't know my old name and some might not even know I even had other than Sofia. The only thing I don't have is the what I did back then.

For a moment this afternoon, I missed her again. Her absence hurt just like it did months ago when the wound was still fresh.

Yesterday, was it?, I read that passage of that first time we went to the motel. When timidly we exchanged clothes and showed our most vulnerable self to each other. I read what happened in both my own words and hers. I felt this tingling sensation ran down my neck, my chest, my stomach all the way to my legs. It was as if I could feel her hand and fingers again, peeling my shell in the most delicate way.

How could I not miss her?

Paola posted something in the whatsapp group conversation about tomorrow's gathering. The first one to reply was Catherine, followed by Chevo and Jessica. The conversation continued and morphed. I think it was her again who posted the image of a monopoly of friends, saying they should (we?) have it. Again, everyone replied but S and I. It was the third message about the cake, or more precisely, the notification of Catherine's response to it, that made me respond. I asked the time that was agreed on and apologized for not confirming before.

Catherine saw it almost instantly. Paola answered. 5 minutes later S responded saying she could not promise anything about going.

I continued with my own trip down my memories. The night came and almost passed. Again I slept until after 5 in the morning. I woke up 4 hours later, with several notifications. Some were of the group and tomorrow. The urged Paola to go. They didn't do that with me, but of course the context is way different. Others were about the patient down there in Mexico city, the procedure. Eduardo asked about me and Alan, if we would be available Monday. One was Eusebio's checking up on me: "you decided to go? ;)". I can't remember the last time he reached out.

I got to the part of 2016 and the conversation I remember we had about them being apart. Catherine was right, it was because of that joke about being pregnant where they left us out. "I don't know what is it, but I don't seem to flow with you", Jessica said to me that time.

There is a difference between us back then and the night I talked to her in Argana.

Tomorrow we'll go to the United States in the morning. We have to come back around 2 in the afternoon. The kingsday dinner won't be until 8 o'clock. Do I want to arrive early or late? Is not being the first or the last one that worries me.

I have surpassed a lot of different obstacles and problems. I did have many fights with Catherine. This, too, will pass. Maybe in a couple of years I'll return to read these entries and feel just as I feel right now. Everything then didn't really matter or was solvable. Even the problems I haven't gotten to, yet. The exams of entrance and interviews, looking for an apartment, changing my name, leaving Catherine behind, our first break-up. All that was from before 2018.

Everything will be all right. I can do this.



## 2019-01-05

it's a quarter to seven. The time agreed was from 7 and a half to 8.

My mum told me we would go to the United States and reassured me that this time we would go in the morning. "Around 8 we should be exiting, so you should better go to bed now. You won't be able to get up".

I was in the other couch of the living room, the one in front of the window. I had my computer on my lap and were reading still the 2016 year, I was halfway of it. Not much later of her departure to her room, Miguel left, too.

I went to bed but continued reading. I really don't believe how much I had forgotten, or chose to ignore. I reviewed the pictures of the years passed, our smiles, the happy memories. We almost fought non-stop since the moment she got a job until we left for the city. Even before that.

For every picture of a date filled with smiles, there were three hidden stories of my rage, sadness and her lack of comprehension. I even wondered about breaking up around Fall of '16.

I remembered the one of the summer of '17. That was the moment I first thought off when I got the idea of the relationship seasons. I mentioned it to her when we did break-up a couple of months later around the earthquake. "We've been breaking up since June". Sweetie, you were breaking up since a year before...

Maybe I didn't get that realization until today. I fell asleep missing her. Reading of the week in Mexicali and the whole night of sex. In the morning I checked her twitter like any other addict filled with craving. She had retweeted again the tweet that talked about a woman who hated everything, and one lamenting showering in the mornings. I saw them around 6 in the morning and they were already almost an hour old. But they weren't the only things. She had sent an animated image of two turtles having a mating dance, where one slaps continuously the other on the face. "You with me", she captioned the tag to her chilean friend. I could not stop thinking about our night in Mexicali and relating it to them in Vegas. No, maybe Chicago. Of course in her own home. Was it jealousy? It surely was a different kind of sorrow.

I was filled with rage with myself. I kept thinking about the christmas party. I imagined us again in the table playing and I gazing at her. "Never have I ever fucked in Chicago", I imagined myself saying staring directly at her and seeing how she didn't need to reply for me to know what she were thinking "hey, what the fuck?".

"Never have I ever been fucked by a Chilean". I kept hearing a murmur as I dried myself.

I sat at the edge of my bed with my wet pajamas and looked again at the profile in my phone. He had tagged her with an image of a football match of their respective countries' selections. She replied three times. The first time saying of course she'd go to that one next to an image of a heart. The second and third were her realizations that she'd be in Monterrey that day and asking him to have a videocall that day.
A couple of minutes ago I saw she had liked one "At what age do you lose the hope of finding love?", and posted herself an image cut in half, two spotify controls with a caption that every or most songs reminded the author of the subject. The upper one was Brillas of Larregui and the one below "Chinga tu madre" of Molotov.

Whether she knows or not I see her profile, I guess it is pretty sure that both of us are still healing.

It's seven minutes past seven. I had thought about sending a message to Paola asking her, confirming that the event would not be cancelled because of the weather and asking if she need me to take something, when I was changing blouses. Just now Catherine sent a message to the group asking the agreed time.

I answered. Nobody else has said anything. Both Eusebio and Jessica saw my message. If only she or I end up going it would be really really uncomfortable. Do I prefer it to be cancelled?

It's stopped raining already.

I'll leave town again in 3 days. I was left with the mood of the last entry were I was alone in my apartment after Catherine's return. I feel nervous and anxious and stressed and those are the feelings I have not related at all to Catherine.

Monica didn't replied to my message in messenger yesterday. Neither did Johanna. She got home today, she finally tell me after I sent her another one. I didn't mention that I would see the guys. I guess I won't have her by my side tonight, if the evening doesn't get cancelled.

Paola hasn't replied. Nobody. In 20 minutes if nothing is said I'll ask.

We crossed in the car all of us this time. They didn't ask me to pass using the pedestrian gates. Maybe it was of the cold. Although any warm feelings I might have had from that were long gone when my father called my attention using my old name. I didn't even try to hid the repulsion and ire from my face. I threw at the table the straw that was given with my glass. I think nobody noticed. I thought about telling him not to ever say that name again, but decided against it. Next time, surely.

Norma and Jessica might come with us to my birthday dinner. I guess I won't be as alone as I had feared.

Catherine sent another message. "Whoever has any news of Paola or is on the way, please give notice!" and an emoticon. This time I won't answer. The odds of nothing happening tonight keep growing.

I can't really tell what I am feeling about that. A part of my wants it to be cancelled even though I am changed and almost ready. Other one wants to see her, to get a feeling of how things were left and what's going to happen next.

There is a notification of the group. My heart is racing a bit. It's Paola. She's fixing the room. I guess "nothing" won't be the end result of tonight. Catherine laughed and replied with an OK. I asked if she needed something. Do I look off-putting in chat? Are my messages dry?

At what time should I be leaving? Do I want to get there first and be with her alone? Or do I want to make sure someone else besides Catherine has arrived? Chevo and Jessica will be late surely. I... I really don't want to plan the whole night and construct a castle from all the possibilities.

Now I'll just wait until she answers me, or anyone for that matter, to leave.

## 2019-01-06

This is my last day being 25 and I literally spent it sleeping.
I don't feel like doing, thinking it feeling anything.

[cheating]

I had cheated like an hour ago, just two hours before midnight lying under my sheets in the darkness of my room. I didn't feel like getting up, not even to eat nor go to the bathroom. I didn't want to be awake. I don't want to.

I slept more than 15 hours and was in bed since 3 in the morning until 11 o'clock in the night.

Why did I finally get up? It's 20 minutes before midnight, before my birthday. I kept reaching to the phone as if Catherine would send me something. Why do I keep waiting for an apology? In her mind she did nothing wrong. Maybe she didn't actually do anything wrong.

Last night was a disaster but this time I can't blame it neither on her nor the alcohol. I left just moments after she responded she was already on her way. Halfway she said she was already in Soriana and would wait for them to enter everybody together. "You guys" were Chevo and Jessica. I sent a message asking if they were going to park inside the lot. It was ignored. I passed her car and she was sitting with her phone on her hands. A big part of the night she spent it on the phone, talking with somebody. She once showed a picture of Carlos to Jessica and Eusebio. Why did I care?

I got out of the car and entered the supermarket. I expected to see them on the way. I didn't see her car anymore. I thought I saw them going through the door and felt this rage inside of me. Why didn't they answer or waited for me? I was mistaken. Partly. They weren't them. But they did enter and they did went to Paola. My messages stayed ignored and someone asked Paola to bring down socks. I bought a litter of chocolate milk and Styrofoam cups. I got outside the apartment and sent a message asking someone to open the door for me. I saw them inside the room. I thought it was Catherine but I was wrong. Catherine was just coming down the stairs, she saw me and opened the door. I said hello and she said it back. We both got in.

They ordered pizza but I didn't eat. We played dominoe and later they played a game from Catherine's phone. I sent messages to Monica trying to distract myself. Catherine herself was chatting with someone, Carlos probably, or maybe some other friend. We cut the cake before Oscar left. He hugged me instead of a handshake, but there was something different. He knows about me. Even when people are OK with me, somehow they treat me differently.

This time I sometimes said things direct at her. We didn't talked really, but we didn't pretend the other person didn't exist either. Eusebio talked about his new apartment and everyone talked about giving him things, doing an open-house party. Why did I feel bad because of that?

Catherine never said anything with a bad tone like the time before. Maybe the apology did have an use. I still felt like shit and didn't have the alcohol to ease my mind.

Paola asked her if she had thought about renting. She offered to look for something even though she really doesn't plan on doing it soon. Catherine told how she had thought about it. She crosses almost always in the Otay border and thought about looking for something there. When I heard I thought she was talking about renting in Otay on the other side of the border. I asked and everybody looked at me as if I were an idiot. Of course not, it's really expensive. She had seen an apartment, was it her or Paola?, around 4k pesos. Two rooms, but it was way too expensive.

I opened up a little telling how I couldn't relate. Eusebio and Renan are paying less for a complete apartment less than I pay for a room. They were talking about an apartment being too expensive, again, less than what I pay now. I remember hearing her voice saying that I live in Mexico city. It was given as an explanation, a reason, but it didn't do nothing for me. They continued how it's the norm there, sharing with roomies. The culture of sharing with tens of people. I just stayed quiet after that.

Was it then or other time when I mention my issues with my degree and how I don't know what I will do?

Why did I open up? Why did I wanted to hear how my problems are bigger than her?

When they finally said they were going to leave and all of us starting cleaning I asked Paola if she could wait with me 5 minutes after their departure. Of course, she answered without a thought.

All of us went outside. I said good-bye to both of them and they left. Catherine hugged Paola and then went to her car.

Paola and I returned. There was some little-talk before I started. "What did you wanted to talk about?" she said. I just extended my arms and started crying. I let it all out on her shoulder. "I feel very anxious". I opened up about how I felt, how I thought about leaving. How she didn't even say good-bye, although at the same time she didn't say anything that were reason enough for me to feel this way.

We talked more than I had planned and I came home.

I went to bed and didn't get up. In two minutes is my birthday.

## 2019-01-07

I don't know how to start. All morning I kept looking at my phone as if I were expecting Catherine's message. I thought about all three possible options. Either she would not send anything, she'd send a dry message straight to the point, or she'd send a more elaborate one. I thought about what would I do at every possibility.

After doing my words I sat in the couch and watched anime until a couple of hours after midnight. Around 3 I was tired again and went to bed. Alberto, from Salamanca, was the first one to congratulate me. I woke up around 8, maybe 10 in the morning and viewed the notifications in the phone. There were some from different people but none from anyone of the group. I went back under the covers. I didn't got up until the afternoon, a couple of hours before just now, the exact time I needed to get ready for the dinner at 6 o'clock.

Monica did send me a message around 3. Yesterday we did not exchange any messages. It's weird feeling this alone. I didn't made any mention of all the dreams I had with her.

In them I actually felt that our friendship would not work. In one of the firsts we had sex. I actually bled from my genitals. Then, in others, things started to get uncomfortable with how I desired her but my feelings were not reciprocated. Be it the case in real life or not, I decided against starting any conversation.

She has her holiday week right now. I asked her if she had plans for tomorrow and she answered yes. Anyway I didn't had plans of seeing her.

I went to shower and cried most of the time inside. When I got out and came down to my room, I saw a message from Catherine in my phone "Nunca he sabido cÃ³mo hacer esto, si se felicita o no al ex jaja
Pero no olvido que hoy es tu cumpleaÃ±os, asÃ­ que te deseo un Feliz cumpleaÃ±os, de verdad deseo que este nuevo aÃ±o venga acompaÃ±ado de fuerza y entendimiento que te guÃ­en a afrontar los retos que te ponga la vida. QuÃ© encuentres cosas nuevas que te llenen y que disfrutes. Simplemente que disfrutes lo que estÃ¡ por venir. Felices 26!"

That's what I wanted, wasn't it? At first I didn't know how to feel, even less how to reply.

I ended up saying how it all depends on how things ended, and how, in our case, I would had understood if she hadn't. "While it's sincere and not just because of obligation, I guess it's OK. Thanks, it means a lot to read you"

All along the dinner, I kept opening the conversation and reading her message. That would be it. That was what I wanted, wasn't it? What more did I expect?

The application is open for the neurohackademy in Seattle. I read the questions and what information was expected. The only thing that I need is to update my curriculum. The deadline is 18th of February.

Halfway through my words I receive another message from Catherine. Just now Miguel posted a picture with her. The message was a question. No. That was after that. "It wasn't obligation" and a rudimentary happy face. Well, now I had what I wanted, a continuation. Why did it feel anticlimactic? Why am I this difficult? Somehow it wasn't enough.

Fifteen minutes later she continued: "From your point of view, how did we end? Because I don't understand why you say you'd understood that I hadn't"

That is the last message I have gotten from her, half an hour ago. I did answer, but, what's the point?

Paola asked me if it didn't hurt because deep down I expect her to return. I said no, just like I told Jessica and Eusebio. I wasn't really attracted to her by the end of our relationship. And yet again, I dreamed I climbed in bed with her and got over her naked body. I kissed her neck and then her mouth and then fucked her.

Why the fuck do I miss her, then? Why does it still hurt after all this time? What in the fuck am I waiting for, what do I really want?

"Well, for start I deleted you from Facebook and whatsapp, and besides we haven't really talked.

"Saturday you left without saying good-bye to me, I thought I would not hear from you again.

"In your place, just because of this [first message] I would had not send anything. Regardless of what had happened."

10 minutes ago I added something that was left unsaid, and I guess even if doesn't change anything, should be said:

"Nevertheless, I am glad you did"



## 2019-01-08

When the fuck will I ever feel alright?

The conversation with Catherine continued until it went way too far. I sent a final message around 6 in the afternoon that stays unanswered. Even though I archived the conversation, I keep opening it up again and again, to see if she's online.

Although I made no mention of it or my feelings about the lack of messages from the rest of the group, Monica sent me a message aggressively asking me of snapping out of my misery and self-hate. I same the same last OK messages to both girls around the same time close to noon. None has answered. Monica does have her plans and she also mentioned she would go to her dancing classes. Catherine liked a tweet stating "There are people so toxic that they make you think you are the toxic one". Of course.

I spent most of the afternoon in bed, again. I don't know from where will I get the energy to get up in the mornings and actually do my work. I am tired, I am sad. I just want to sleep. I might actually just want to die.

Eusebio sent me a message, too, around 1. He apologized and explained he wanted to call me yesterday but missed his chance. He also asked around what time would I be free so he would drop a call. I ignored him until I sent the last message to Catherine. I told him that around 9 in the evening, which is right now.

After I finished my words, Catherine replied to the message where I said she had left without saying good-bye, she explained that she believed she didn't from Paola either, and that she was very cold. I answered almost instantly stating that she did. She hugged her, turned and left. It was alright, tho, it didn't matter.

There was no answer. An hour later, after midnight, I asked her if what I said was what she wanted to know. I know I didn't really answer her question. But felt the need to continue the conversation. I didn't want to let her go, again.

"Kinda, but it doesn't matter. I am really sorry, I didn't realize, it was not intentional"

I said how I had considered asking her a similar question since new years' evening that she mentioned something like "I didn't expect all of this to happen", but that maybe she was right and it didn't matter.

"To me, I had ended things well with you around March. Months later it was that you deleted me from social networks and stopped talking to me.

"And I told you, that I understood and took it as part of your process. I didn't take it personal, it's just that I got lost in that process. Then the Christmas party happened."

I told about how it wasn't the break-up, although I didn't really get what had happened until way later, but the trip to Vegas that broke me.

"What did you expect from Vegas?", she asked missing totally my point. Now I knew why she never apologized, she didn't even realize what had happened.

I told again the story. I regretted forcing myself to the trip, I was uncomfortable, the back-seat and the conversation the next morning. How they went out with Eusebio and Jessica and after her friend's departure she again contacted me. I deleted her from everything.

Then I also talked about how I got that she was fine and completely over me. I was happy for her, but how she didn't had to say she understood completely or didn't take it personal. I mentioned how Paola told me she had vented with her, and the comments she made in the party.

"In the party I was uncomfortable because you were ignoring me, maybe it was because of the alcohol. In the games, it was my turn and you were absent-minded, later you would ask Paola what had I drawn instead of me directly... things like that. That made me uncomfortable and that it was in front of everybody.

"I never liked seeing you drunk, then even less" instead of a period, she ended the sentence with a laugh.

"About Vegas, many told me that I shouldn't had invited you. Just because you were my ex, you should not go.
Honestly I felt pressured when you said you wanted to go to Chicago. Even in another hotel, and started giving these options. All of that stressed the fuck out of me. Because Chicago was something for me. Practically I went to Chicago to do all of which you once complained.
"Not thinking that I'd do it because you didn't like it, but because I do.
"I went to all the tourist attractions, I went to the Pokemon Go Fest, I played on the streets. Honestly I don't remember that you ever said you wanted to go to Chicago.

"I even felt bad for not inviting you and gave you the option of Vegas. Because to me it was the best. Chevo and Jessi would go, and we would all go in group. Because is my relationship with Carlos causes you something, we never were a couple.

"Getting to Vegas I said 'fuck it, we're here'... but you were distant since the moment you saw me. And Carlos wasn't present."

She then recounted what she had said about Monica, her being my process and how she didn't want to know or be involved in any of it.

Thinking about Chicago again left me this huge sting in my heart. I felt again that wound that I thought I had already gotten over with.

I told her what I said several times of Carlos and her not being my business. How the hurt was from being trapped with them, seeing them. Chicago had hurt because of personal and selfish reasons. In Vegas I had gone to her and she left. And Monica never was something I worked with in therapy.

She apologized becuase of the misunderstanding. No, there was a misunderstanding because of her shutting me off the conversation the day after Vegas, and she apologized for that.

"And that it hadn't have been because of therapy, from my point of view doesn't make things that better" again she finished with a laugh.

I explained too much about Monica saying how she had been there for me more than any of the group, ironically before of what would happen later. 10 minutes later I asked her if there was anything left to talk about. Something she wanted to say or ask. Another ten minutes later she replied back negatively and asking me.

I lied saying no.

Half an hour later I asked her what was the reason behind contacting me last year. What did she feel or expect?

"Well, because according to me we were fine
"I told you that my intention was never to lose contact.

That was around noon. I replied with OK.
6 hours later I explained to her the reason behind my question. I had this idea, maybe even now, that she saw me as this toxic person that only hurt her. That breaking up with me was a point pf pride in her year. And how thinking that it confused me she would want to contact me. I backpedaled in the same message saying that it didn't add anything and how I was only letting everything out. I apologized.

As I was writing the last paragraph I saw the 'typing words' under her name in the conversation. I freaked out. Then the phone rang with the picture of Eusebio.

We talked for maybe 15 minutes. He wanted to say happy birthday and explained how he kept calling to the wrong phone. When he mentioned about inviting me to do something Thursday, I heard the notification of the new message. Maybe three times I almost broke down mid-conversation.

I haven't seen her message. I am nervous about what she might say. I'l look.

Monica's harsh conversation started just after I sent the last OK to Catherine after my last question.

"Hopefully you'll stop suffering for people that don't care about you
"Really"

"Wut", it came out of nowhere but at the same time at the most precise moment.

"That you return to Mexico with an attitude of leaving behind all drama and starting fresh without begging to your friends of UABC"

"I have no friends from UABC" I replied smart-ass-ly. She explained without getting the joke.

I opened up. It wasn't them, or not only them. I am stressed and feel so much pressure.

"I do have alcohol issues, and it has to do with all of this. I'm stressed about my university degree, I can't finish the master without that paper. I will be set back for that freaking paper and don't know how to explain to my tutor or mates that is because of me being trans.
"I can't get a job, not even when I was a cishet white man, who-knows now that I don't have how to proof my studies. I'll have to stay who-knows how many months living in hte city without any income and the pressure of looking for a job and the frustration of not being hired by anyone.
"I have tons of projects and plans and awesome things that I should be proud about, and yet I feel like a failure for such stupid things.
"So, yeah, I am stressed about returning to Mexico independently of the high school drama"

Then she hit where I wouldn't had imagined.

"Don't tell me your tutor doesn't know you're trans" "Is it that obvious"

"Yes [...]"

What? Was she serious? I know it is not true. Not completely and yet, it hit like none other thing had hurt me before. Coming from her, who said I was pretty, how I was this stunning and sophisticated woman. It didn't end there.

She continued how I should just keep trying. Keep looking. Her brother took 3 months to find something, her ex, 5. It's difficult for everybody, she finished erasing my concerns.

She continued repeating the same thing. I should not victimize myself and snap out of it. It will be hard but I should not lament and just lick my wounds. I am brilliant and should not throw it all away. I thought about how Said and Diego keep repeating that about Josue. He's brilliant. He's the most intelligent person they know. He had this 20k paying job almost instantly after getting his degree.

"If you're going to spend your days crying, forget about having real friends. Nobody wants to be anyone's crying shoulder"

She replied to my "geez thanks" about being obviously trans with a "you asked. And there's nothing bad about it being notorious", again, missing my point.

"I guess not, but I don't like thinking that I look like a man"

"Well, you need an intervention, girl. Snap out of it. I don't like thinking that I have uglier teeth than the brittish. Itzel doesn't like thinking that because of being so short and her enormous bust she looks like a hunchback and a milking cow.
"Gotta live with it"

Why was she being this aggresive? I didn't tell about being in bed all day yesterday. I didn't mention about thinking about killing myself again. I hide it all too well. Or at least I thought I did.

"I know you're trying to help, I get it, I appreciate it. Thanks, but let's let it die here.
" I know it's hard to just hear me complain, I've been trying not to do it. Sorry if I'm this Debbie Downer. I'll work on it.
"With the guys, I get it. With the university and all of that, I'll deal with it. About my appearance I can't do anything. It is my biggest insecurity and I don't want to talk about it.
"Sorry. I am really thankful that you want to help."

She didn't let it die.

"Fortunately it's something aestetic. If it were something serious, then it'd be fucking tough. You're so much more than the physical, but it seems that you have forgotten. I hope you will find peace. I wont tell you any more because it is a pain in the ass to hear this. That you complain, we all do. But you cry everyday because of the same thing, and is because you're not content with anything and that depends only in you. Forget about looking for pep talks and see what your psychologist says. You know way more than that. There's nothing we can tell you us who love you, until you realize what's going on. Been there. I'm being this pain in the ass because I think everyone's pampering you with 'yeah, poor Sofi' and 'how are things in Tijuana, everything OK?'. Be the bad guy. It's ok feeling insecure, we're human. Eventually that feeling will come. Just don't let it ruin your happiness. You deserve way more than that. There. I won't say anything more.

"I'll shut the fuck up, and make me something to eat."

To her, too, I sent another message around 6pm. She hasn't answered. She hasn't even received it. For a moment I worried that she had blocked me as well.

Catherine's message said:

"Uhm no. I don't see you as a person who just hurt me. I have many nice memories, I learned and discovered many things with you. I'm thankful of everything we went through and don't regret anything. That I told you
"Only near the end it wasn't healthy anymore, neither to me, nor I for you. And I also told you that I wanted to break up because I didn't want us to end badly"

Well, shit.

## 2019-01-09

Everything keeps turning worse and worse.

Last night I didn't slept. Not continuously anyway, or more than half and hour. I felt the warmth of Nymeria on my legs but it wasn't enough. After Catherine's last message I didn't reply, although I had the words at the tip of my fingers. I would let it until the morning. By then I had realized that it was a compulsion with the purpose of only keeping the conversation going.

It was 5:30 in the morning, when Luis opened the door to tell me the bathroom was empty. He left it open and I was irritated, angry. I shut it with a slam. Minutes later my dad would open it again. In the darkness I didn't recognize him and just complained. He thought someone had fallen. I closed it again and tried to sleep fruitlessly.

I showered and, did I cry in the shower? Was it today or my birthday?

I put on my clothes and finished packing the suitcase. My mom drove me. This time I didn't feel the sorrow of leaving my dog behind. I was just numb and tired. Void.

At the airport I checked the baggage and my mum bought me coffee. She asked me if I had stopped taking the antidepressants. She's worried. All of them are. I should be as well.

Way back in the morning, just after showering, or was it before?, I sent Catherine the message. I put an emoticon with a twisted mouth and apologized for making everything this difficult.

She answered while I was showering, only a couple of minutes later

"Ps es tu sentir", well, it's how you feel. What does that even mean?

I guess I should leave it there. I thought about a couple of days, maybe weeks. I could wait a month until her birthday.

I read the whole flight. Almost the whole flight. The last half an hour I listened to music and cried looking out the window. When we took off, I saw the university, Plaza Rio, the international highway. I remember how she narrated when she flew to Chile and cried seeing all of those places, our places.

Monica sent me a message. I was worried that she'd be angry or upset because I didn't took well her 'snap out of it' speech. I guess she wasn't.

Yesterday I put back the name in Catherine's contact. It's weird seeing her name, pretending that things are better when they are not.

I sometimes went back to the conversation to see if she were online. Paola posted about some hoodies for Valentines'. We could order some for the group. I thought about Monica, she's right. That was lame, that was stupid and corny and I would only waste money in something I wouldn't even care about. And yet I didn't say no.

When we landed I received a series of e-mails, one of them about the meeting of the committee yesterday. In it they stated how, for the research visits, those longer than a month would require that the applicant had taken his or her final exam and to have the signed approval of all the tutors. If that were the case, it would be approved. But they could not tell us the amount of stipend nor when would they give it to us. In bold they stated, If the starting date of the visit is before the date of the publication of the approvals, then they would no longer be able to give us the stipend. Not only that, but they had no information about when that date would be.

The woman had the nerve to ask us to confirm of received. If we had any doubts to tell her.

I felt this sadness and disappointment surge over me. Other opportunity down the drain. I was so excited about that. I am already leaving this room. I saw it as this sure thing and it was gone.

I would need to present my final exam. The research is done, the results are done. It's just to redact them. But... but... I wanted to be out of her when the guys would travel to Monterrey. I wanted to have this for once.

Maybe we can shorten it. Maybe we can postpone it. Maybe, just maybe I won't lose this too.

A couple came to see the room. The friend of Maleny told her to tell them about the cleaning. "That they do it". I felt like thrash again. I didn't do what I had to. I can't do anything right.

I feel this pressure and uncertainty and I just want to explode.

I can't wait anymore for tomorrow's session, although I don't even know from where to begin.

## 2019-01-10

I am really tired. I went to bed almost straight when I got home. I got up now at 9:30 pm and still don't feel the energy to do the words.


## 2019-01-11

I just woke up from a nightmare. It's 8 o'clock. I thought I wouldn't do the words again. I feel tired, sad. I, again, slept most of the day.

In the nightmare I was with the group, it was this kind of restaurant. Was it the group-group? I remember Catherine being there, I hugged a woman by the end who was her mother, but really didn't look like here. Maybe it was the same with the other guys? No. We all were lying over the tables as if we were sleeping. I was next to both Jessica and Paola. We were kind of hugging, spooning. They were them.

By the end my father came to pick me up and it was when all went to shit. We couldn't find my shoes, and he started treating me like this kind of freak. He whispered stuff in my ear. I begged him to talk of it later. A blonde woman was outside, I remember wondering if it was Monica. She wasn't.

Yesterday the stuff about my research visit to Maryland kind of cleared out. Kind of. Eduardo sent me a Telegram message when I was waiting by the end of the street for the bus to come. In it he asked me if I was going to the lab. He would leave around 1 in the afternoon, and we had to talk about the visit and the e-mail.

When I got there he was talking to this guy about his options for grad school. His project and where could he apply. Half an hour later, when he left, I just turned in my chair and asked him "So, what do think about the e-mail"

"Stupid..."

He called Barrios, Aliza's tutor. The chatted for around 5 minutes and then we talked. There was no problem with the fourth and final exam. They could all just sign it without issue. About the date of departure and publication of the results, Barrios had told him that it was unusual that they didn't have it yet. It usually comes out by now.

So the conclusion was that we would just wait. If by the end of the month there were no news, we would just change the date, he would apologize with Dardo, but this is how things are in this country. But there was still the possibility that we didn't have to do that.

So there was that. We talked about what was left to do. I wouldn't just write the paper alone, I would make the draft and he'd finish it. I have still to send a letter to the editorial team of the journal. I had to sent it to him by yesterday and I haven't done it.

I waited for him to leave before going to eat. I was the last person to leave the office around 2:30 pm. I had my therapy session at 4. I went to le petite. I thought I would eat alone, but I saw Said and Javi sitting. They were surprised when I didn't order a beer. I explained generally why.

"Did you take something? Anything? Maybe the drinks were adultered? It's too little to get to that point".

Yeah, the were right. I have drunk more before without getting like that.

"It was the emotional mood you were in". I made no mention of Catherine. Said broke up with his girlfriend, too.

"I finished my 3 year relationship"

I got late to my session. It was mostly just narrating what had happened and why I felt like shit. I will see Faust again weekly. "It's not that everything's lost. It's normal in every kind of treatment to get kind of a relapse. But things will get better, this time might be easier... There is no longest night that doesn't see the light of day".

He has this idea that I get nothing out of the group. "You are 'filled with poison' right now, so you must let it all out. That's why they are called 'toxic people', because of the poison you get with them".

I don't buy it. I am the poisonous one. I am the one whom everyone should leave behind.

The bus to my house pass just moments before I reached the bus stop. I grabbed the next one to the office and then caught up with it. At least now I know that it does pass there.

I came home and went almost straight to bed. It was around 6 in the afternoon. I slept all of the afternoon and the set of night.

I woke up around two hours before midnight. Then later again around 3 in the morning. I saw a the final episodes of FMA.

I left the room because someone came to see it. This time it was a doctor. Or a med student, more precisely. Yesterday it was a couple, were they doctors, too?

I would mention how I receive no message from neither Mon nor Cath. Catherine would and will not send me a message. Why do I keep expecting her and missing her? I was better. I swear I didn't feel like this anymore.

I woke up around the three alarms I had set for today but decided against going to the lab. I stayed in bed most of the morning. My roommate's friend put on loud music after noon. I had slept already more than 14 hours and yet I was exasperated because of it.

Eduardo publicize the neurohackademy to the rest of the lab. I was disappointed. I wanted it for myself. To try and either get accepted or rejected without their knowing.

Just now he sent me a message if he could ask me a question. It was about this friend who had a trans woman colleague that wanted to do the legal changes...

So, I guess Monica was right and everybody knows and notices.

## 2019-01-12

I debated the idea with myself for most of these last days. I had thunk that there was no point in making any statements; I would not see them for the rest of this semester and maybe by then everything would just fade away. But then again, I would be paying money for a symbol of what I don't really have, what is hurting.

Around my six in the morning I sent the message. I need this to stop. I might have stop cutting my skin, but I am slicing my soul over and over with hurting memories.

"Pao, you haven't made the order of the hoodies, right? I'm going to cancel. Don't order mine, sorry.
"If you've made it, it doesn't matter, I'll pay for it and you can give it to Paola."

Not much later I slept again. All of the morning I spent it in sleep. Lately I've been sleeping way too much. I didn't see her answer until 2 in the afternoon, even though she sent it just an hour after my message.

"No, just today I was going to make the deposit.
"How about that, Sofi?"

"I don't know how to explain it.
"I've been thinking about it and I think the best for everybody, but mostly for myself, is that I take do take some space.

"I don't flow well with everyone, and it's not just Catherine. Now in Tj I hurt myself deeply everytime I saw all of you guys. You saw how I was the 5th. It's also the ignored messages, the chat about the apartments, feeling like I don't belong anymore and forcing myself to stay in the group.

"I know it's all me, my fault, but, regardless, at lest for now, I am hurting myself wanting to stay there.

"And right now, the hoodies saying 'best friends' after all of this, is like rubbing salt on the wound."

She has not answered, and probably won't. What can you say to something like that?

I felt both appreciated and bothered when Monica sent me a message yesterday asking how I was doing.

Isn't that what I wanted from them since the beginning? A 'how you doing' message now and then, a little reciprocity in looking for each other. A shown of interest.

Why do I resent it from another friend?

It's the same with the dating apps. Matches keep coming, I keep sweeping and ignoring them. What do I want from them? First I cynically resent them knowing they won't start the conversation, they will just ignore me; and then, when they do, I am the one who doesn't answer. Don't I want to meet them? Don't I want to be with someone, anyone?

I feel like this unattractive, unlovable, broken person. Just yesterday I matched with maybe 5 or 10 people from both the apps. I've received the phone number of one and another sent me a message. I haven't answered and probably never will.

 How will I not stay alone if I push everybody away?

I have two items in my to-do list and I haven't started any of them. Just update my CV and redact the inquiry letter to the journal. One hour, tops, is the time it would take me to finish. But I can't start. Even just doing my words, is tiring.

I want to lie down on the bed, hide under the sheets and keep dying.

I showered today. I shaved.

A woman rang the doorbell around 4 in the afternoon. I tried to ignore it and just turn towards the wall to keep sleeping. Then she hit the door. It could be my roommate or one of her damned friends. I got up and went without my glasses. I opened the door and barely recognized she was an older woman that I haven't seen before. I covered with my hand the depression stubble of not shaving since Thursday. She apologized about waking me up. Who apologizes for waking up somebody at 4 in the afternoon? She called me a girl, a sweet girl.

I am 26, with less than 3 years on female hormones. I am in no sense of the word a girl.

It was about smoking. Cigarette butts thrown out of the window. I don't smoke. Now it's less of a lie than before. I haven't smoked since the Christmas party. I haven't drunk since Christmas. I don't feel the urge to smoke and yet I would do almost anything for a bottle of liquor right now.

Maybe I am an alcoholic.

## 2019-01-14

I missed the words. It was around 5 in the morning when I realized I had forgotten something. What was it that brought it to my attention?

I was reading this book. "Normal People". It's about this Irish couple. It narrates their lives, their encounters and missteps. It goes from their time in high school, towards the end of their college life. It made me think about Catherine and me. A couple of years before, I would had thunk about Monica and me.

It's weird how things turn around. At this time last year things were great with Catherine. They were, weren't they? I had no news about Monica but the usual dreams. When would I had imagined that a year later, I would be receiving Monica's messages out of the blue like yesteryears and Catherine would be the ghost.

Both of the characters in the novel were unlikable. No, they were flawed. I hated him and how he was embarrassed of being seen with her, hiding their relationship. Her self-loathing and bad perception of herself made me uncomfortable, her idea that she was broken and deserved that people treated her like shit because she was so unlovable and dis-likable. Except the latter is how I feel right now and the former is what happened at first when Catherine and I started being a boy-girl couple and then a girl-girl couple.

So I thought about my journals. The jumps in time, the narration of this slice of life. And then I remembered and saw the time and realized it was 5 in the morning. In just a couple of hours I would need to get out of bed and get ready for the day.

It wasn't just that. I spent, again, the whole day in bed. Not as extremely as my birthday's eve, but still not normal. My mum sent me a message this morning when I was on the bus to the lab. How was I, how had I been.

I didn't lie, but I didn't get into details either. I made no mention of how every hour I feel this urge to cry my soul out. How I keep this shadow over me that presses me down and suffocates me. But that's not what I wanted to get into when I started last paragraph. There was another theme of the book.

The guy fucked things up. He invited another girl to the dance and the girl dropped out of school. She ignored his calls and messages. And just as they met months later at the college they both went to, after every problem they kept meeting each other, talking to each other just to drift again. They loved and were attracted to each other, and yet they had other lovers or toxic partners. But they were best friends, they understood each other and were with each other after all those months they didn't exchange a word.

And just as I've been wanting to cry all month, I had this urge to reach out to her. In the morning I decided not to. In a couple of weeks it will be her birthday and I could do what she did. In a couple of days it will be my therapy session and I can talk about this and be dissuaded by Faust. 'What do I expect from this? In what way does this would make me feel better? How could I see this helping me in the long run?'

He would give me tools to not do it, to control this anxiety and melancholy. To not succumb to nostalgia.

I posted a picture of the drawing of us I made years ago. The one of the two girls wearing dresses and our names written in Ellian's script. At first I couldn't decipher it. Then it hit me. It wasn't Cath, it was Chris. "Saudade": a deep emotional state of nostalgic or profound melancholic longing for an absent something or someone that one loves. It often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing might never return.

I fantasized about her seeing it. Of course she wouldn't. Even when we had each other on social networks, she said she didn't go to my profiles. Once I told her I was seeing hers and she didn't get it. When I asked her if she ever went to mine, she answered, baffled "Why would I?"

Later I saw a reply she made to a tweet of Carlos from 2014. A picture of the meal she had prepared for both of them. She just commented a red heart. "Because if my relationship with Carlos bothers you, we were never a couple". I went to think how it would be almost impossible for her to just scroll all the way to then, like I did in Summer after Vegas. Maybe she looked at her own notifications and mentions, she scrolled those and got there. Maybe their conversation made her think about that and she looked for it there. Maybe one of those media views from my pictures was in fact hers, and sent her on a nostalgia trip down her own twitter. But, who was I kidding, of course it wasn't.

So the picture would be another lost message. Like the ones that I say because I want them out of me more than I want them to arrive somewhere.

The message I did send her wasn't one of those, though. I cited her message stating that she told me how her intention wasn't to lose communication, asking: "Do you still feel the same way? about staying in contact"

Half an hour later I sent another, continuing:

"I was thinking about how I wouldn't want just one day to send you a message out of the blue like nothing had happened, after, well, everything... But I guess there is not much difference to this"

That was more than an hour ago.

She was online then in FB messenger, and she's online now, too.

One of the reasons I stopped talking to her when her friend Carlos arrived was because of a feeling like this. I hated how once, after her not seeing my message, I saw her online in FB. I asked her. She wasn't mad, just surprised about how I never had done that before. I was surprised, as well, how dependent I had gotten. I just had this image of her seeing the notification and swiping it away. And I felt crushed.

Except that, then, I was a hurting coming from a deep insecurity and untreated emotional issues, and now, her ignoring it is a completely normal response after months of me ignoring her and deleting her from everywhere.

How can I be hurt that she has gotten over me in every single way? I pushed her to do that.

I wanted her to hurt me just as Marianne wanted her partners to hurt her as well.

Maybe she will answer tomorrow. Or perhaps she just wont.

## 2019-01-15

I didn't go to the Institute nor apply the injection. I could not sleep almost all night. It was around 5 in the morning, no, my flatmate had already left, so it was after 6, when I could sleep. It's Tuesday anyway. Everybody knows we don't go Tuesdays.

It's 6 in the afternoon and I feel like it's night already and the whole day has passed.

Catherine did answer. I... I read it in one way, and then realized it she meant otherwise and now that I read it a third time I can't seem to comprehend what has been said.

"Honestly, I don't know, it's been a long time since we talked. I know that if sometime there were another gathering I wouldn't like seeing you as a stranger.

"I don't know to what extent I could recover the communication."

"It's fine, I get it. I imagined it".

It was both something that caught me off guard and that I had completely thunk it could happen. She didn't let it there, though. If she had had, I don't know what I would had done. Would I had continued talking? Would I had let it die until her birthday?

"I won't deny you a message nor I am asking you to not talk to me.

"But from me, independently of who you are, it's difficult to give you back my trust or go back to talking as if nothing happened.

"Because at this point, we are both strangers."

That last bit killed me. And I told her in my subsequent messages. Right afterwards I told her how I would had preferred she had omitted that last message, but how I completely got her. I mentioned how I had missed her and that I knew things would never be as they were so I wasn't really asking her that. I finished saying my intention wasn't to bother her nor upset her. That I had asked her a question and she answered.

Then she took almost half an hour writing her response. In it, again, I can't tell if she's upset, if she's mad at me or she felt bad about how she took my question. Maybe a little bit of everything, I guess?

"I know it was dramatic, 7 years of our lives haven't banished. But at least these months things had happened, things happened to me and I don't know what has happened to you, I ignore all of that.

"And I don't know if I should tell you this; look me up.

"If it interests you, if you want it, do it.

"More than once I was the one who reached out. And I did until I felt I couldn't anymore, even with your terse responses, even your 'seen's.

"You don't know how hard it was for me not to contact you when you deleted me, I told you that it doesn't hurt that you don't follow me on the media, to me that's not important. But I was worried not knowing about you, that's why I wrote once or twice in that time.

"I just took my distance, because it's not your fault that I had done those things, you didn't ask me to be there. I loved you before starting the relationship because I don't see any other answer to why I kept seeking you.

"You know what hurt me that you talk with Monica... That over the years you keep seeking her.

"Now with my messages I tell you that I don't know to what degree I can recover our communication... I am not saying it won't come back, or that I don't want to, simply that I don't know it would be as before, that I won't deny you a message or I am asking not to talk. And your answer is practically saying good-bye...

"So, no, I am not seeking you anymore. I never closed you the door of communication."

That was her last message until this morning. On my part I wrote her almost a book of the bible.

I thought about it, and even now am not completely convinced this is the right thing. I won't ever get over her if I keep doing this. We broke up, I was dumped. I had every right not to seek her. But I wanted to, I want to.

I don't feel better, though. So maybe my grievance is not completely about her. With her message I thought it would be me sending her messages and she reading them. But she has asked questions, she has continued the conversations. Maybe she has missed me, too.

I don't know for how long this will go on. Maybe in time we will talk like before. Maybe in a couple of weeks we will drift apart in not so bad terms. Maybe I will see something or feel something and explode to her, again, and ruin everything, again. I don't know.

With Monica I sent her a message saying how I did miss her.

"Well, I don't, lol."

The conversation kept and I made no mention of my disappointment. She sensed it, tho. After she said good-bye she came back.

"But before I go, were you upset that I told you I don't miss you?"

A little, I lied. And just went back to laying out what was filling my heart to Catherine's inbox.

## 2019-01-16

It happened again. At first I thought I could avoid it.

I felt ill since I woke up. I could not sleep very well. I went to bed around 8 and slept a couple of hours. Maybe it was around midnight when I woke up. Catherine did answer my message about the fights of my parents. In the afternoon we had talked a little about the process of my graduation, how I had practically finished my master already and just needed to write and publish my paper. I let out a little steam about the frustration of not being able to graduate in time because of my degree and my inability to get hired for any job. She mentioned how I had talked about it. I think she referred to not getting out on time.

After, like an hour after that conversation ended, I mentioned how my parents almost got divorced. I might had exaggerated a little. Maybe she noticed. Why do I keep talking about things that make me miserable?
She asked what had happened around nine and I answered back when I woke up at midnight.

The conversations are mostly her asking questions about what I say, exploring, clarifying or just continuing the conversation. She did answered my question about her own parents, though. How they are not grieving yet because of her grandma being cremated.

I asked her about her, but she missed, or ignored, my question. I told her about what had happened, the meeting with the endocrinologist and the fight. I mentioned how usually when parents separate the children blame themselves, but this time it was because of me, or mostly L.

She asked why. I didn't really know how to explained it. I tried, but the conversation died.

I read a while and returned to sleep around 5 hours later. I postponed the alarm to 15 minutes before 9. There was something inside of me that wasn't right. I could not describe and even now I can't really find the words. It wasn't just tiredness, nor a tingling sensation like in the shower, or the inner feeling of danger and catastrophe.

I got in the shower and almost finished alright. Moments before closing the faucet, I felt tingling in my thighs. There was this mild nausea emerging from my inside. I didn't dry myself and instead sat in the toilet. I thought it could fade in a while. I sat and my respiration went out of control. The inner sense of doom. I hid my head in my knees and waited for it to fade. When a couple of minutes passed and mistakenly thought I was alright I patted myself dry. I stood up and wrapped myself in the towel. I felt lightheaded and instead of going to the sink to shave, or even grabbed my clothes, I went to my room. I left the door open and went straight to the bed. I remember opening my eyes and realizing I had missed the bed. I was naked and kneeling next to the bed with the door opened. My flatmate left yesterday in her holiday trip, maybe even if she hadn't she would be already away in her job anyway, but still I don't think I'd ever be naked with the door open.

I I got up and lied over the towel on the mattress for a couple of minutes. I did shaved and picked up my clothes. Even though I lost a couple of minutes, I was earlier than I had thought. I stopped by the dr for my shot. I didn't applied it myself this time. Maybe the next one. The dr suggested me to buy this type of black syringes, or pediatric ones. The normal ones pierce the skin and hurt more, she said. I could try them.

Said and Viviana were in the lab since the early morning. He had a subject for his project. I started working on the manuscript. Now that I did start it doesn't seem so impossible. I can do it.

 Around 11 Catherine continued yesterday's conversation. "And how is L?" I replied with two long messages. After eating, and having a beer, even though I had said that I would stop drinking, I sent her another one telling about my fainting.

She answered back when I was just leaving the bank after paying for the inscription of the new semester.

"She apologized, saying she was at work. Probably was on her break. She continued saying her mother had called her saying the sister of her grandma had died and they would go to Mexicali. She has been talking with her on her breaks.

"Everything alright, but my mom is is sensitive to the theme of death."

Her last message was a direct reply of the one about my fainting asking if it was today.

When I answered back, I guess she was back from her break.

In the morning I had resolved that I would not continue the conversation. I would wait a day, or a couple. But why? Wasn't a big issue from her messages that I didn't seek her? Why do I feel this need to avoid any show of vulnerability? Why am I so afraid of being ignored, not even rejected?

Is this why I didn't continue the conversation with Monica after she denied missing me?



## 2019-01-17

I decided against going to the office moments before the first alarm. Neither Viviana nor Said would go today. Diego is busy now with his exam. I had planned about going and continuing redacting the manuscript according to the guide for Jama and the paper I had found. I could eat in the place outside of tacos and then leave for therapy. I even put the hours in my calendar.

I was so tired. I postponed first the alarm to 9 in the morning. Or was it 10? I could went around noon and just eat and leave. What was the point then? It would be better just eat here and go straight to my session. And so I deleted all of the alarms. I kept dreaming but can't recall now any of them. Something of Nymeria. A park like Six Flags and the gang. I had the feeling of postponing my leaving, as I were postponing the alarms and my time of getting up.

I had to get up at 1:40 pm so I could have enough time to get ready and arrive at 4. Even that was hard. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared about fainting again.

Catherine didn't answer the message. Was it something to be answered? Maybe she read it as the end of the conversation. Is our communication even something to be worth saving? I wasn't wrong when I said we would never be as we were. There will never be another going to San Diego, or crossing back to Tijuana with the stuff we bought. No more trips to Ensenada, or LA, or anywhere. No more nights lying on the cushions in Argana and smoking and talking and laughing. No more shared nights, be them under the sheets or through our phones.

Maybe she wasn't that wrong when she said we were now strangers.

I didn't wait for the direct bus to Faust's. I instead went to the Lab and bought a bag of chips so I could get change. I didn't wait that much for the other bus.

I got around 20 minutes earlier and bought a bottle of water. I sat on the curb outside the building with my phone. What was I doing? Was I reading something? Looking for something or someone? I was just listening to music. No. I remember now.

When I got to the lab, I read the messages of Telegram. There were some in the group of students and a direct one from Eduardo. The latter was younger than 15 minutes, and said Jama had rejected our paper. The former was a long conversation about the rejection of their paper from translational. They had good reviews with minimum commentaries and instead the editor chose to reject it.

Maybe the publication of mine won't be as straightforward as I had hoped. I mean, it's not as if I were going to be delayed because of a late publication.

I was sitting when I saw Faust arriving to the door. Did he see me first? He waved first. I got to him and we went upstairs. He let me sat a couple of minutes in his office before our time started.

I... I did think about what I was going to talk, didn't I? I broke down almost immediately.

I feel broken, I fear I will end up alone and nobody will ever love me.

He proposed an exercise where I would write down the 12 things I would want to dispose, my 12 monsters or demons. I cried before I even started. He kept them for later sessions. We passed to another exercise of relaxation. I tried to calmed myself, but he even noticed how I looked like a roller-coaster. Going up and down in my own anxiety. As we finished I felt just as I did when I went back with Paola to the salon in her building. I scratched my own legs and squirmed in my own body.

When will I ever get better?

I had resolved of not talking to either of the girls today. I could wait a couple of days to "seek" her out. Should even continue doing that? Shouldn't I follow her example and dedicate time to myself? Work on me?

Like last week, as I crossed the pedestrian bridge I saw my bus go through. I decided to sit and wait for the next one, I could see the interval between them. 45 minutes. I waited almost an hour and got home after that same time riding it.

I ate an omelette and finished my meal with a sandwich. I thought about the days before my leaving the apartment and dreaded posting the sale ad for this desktop that I am typing on and the chair in which I am seated.

It's less than two weeks. What if I don't sell them? I took the pictures and posted the ad.

Catherine did send a message. She replied to the one I asked about her talking to her mum on her breaks, but didn't answered the question. Her parents left yesterday and would arrive later today. She stayed on her job. A couple of her friends from Chile went to Tijuana and she let them sleep in her house. They all went to dinner and breakfast today. She gave them a ride to the bus station. She could not ask for permission on her job.

Why did that last part stung? I remembered her excuses last year. She would not even get permission while Carlos were there. She would still go to the job, how could I not get that? That's what I could not ever understand, the reason she could not come visit. She then had 2 weeks free. "No, they weren't 2 weeks, just 4 days", or were they 6? It doesn't matter.

She asked about my fainting. Had I gone to the doctor? What does he or she say?

I said hypo-tension and stress as surely as if it were something an expert had said. I made no mention of therapy and instead talk shit about my endocrinologist. I thought about talking about my breast pain, but decided against it. It seems like I only talk to her to complain about things. Like old times.

I, instead, asked her, again, how she were doing. And complemented with a question about her heart and health.

She went back from her break, I guess.

I might get my answer around midnight, or tomorrow.

Monica sent me a meme about the 10 year challenge, a set of two pictures of small breasts under a blouse with her caption of "me".

The conversation died prematurely and I felt no urge to resurrect it.

Maybe tomorrow.


## 2019-01-19

I forgot about the words yesterday and just remembered 15 minutes shy of midnight. It was a day just like any other, except it wasn't.

I was on the bus to the Institute when I received Catherine's answer to my message. It was a question responding to my fainting. "Isn't there something that helps you lower the stress levels or prevent the lower blood pressure?".

Then she answered my own question regarding her health, her heart. It was well. She didn't even think about it, hadn't gave any notice until my question. We half-talked a couple of minutes. She would leave for work. Even though she had the sentri card now, the traffic still made her leave a couple of hours before her entry time.

Did I make another question? No, I just said: "Right, well, have a good one".
And it all ended. Again. For the day.

The office was empty when I got in around 10 and a half. The guys came all three together maybe an hour later. Why wasn't I with them? I sure knew about Diego's rehearsal, they said. Except I didn't. "You were with us when Martha gave us the hall." Except I wasn't. It didn't matter.

All day they stood with Diego helping him with his slides for Monday. I mentioned the rejection of Jama, but they kind of ignored it. Diego's test is way more important, I get it, though.

I actually started redacting and making it. Now it doesn't seem that impossible of a task. Maybe I can finish it. At 1 pm we went to eat and decided against coming back. In the evening they would come pick up the desk and the chairs. I will be leaving this room in less than two weeks. Francisco saw my ad and asked me about it. He offered me to crash at his place for a couple of nights if I needed. I told him that I might need only a week after January if everything turns out right.

I was eating when I saw the e-mail that everything, in fact, wouldn't.

It was an update about the funding. They had no news about the publication of the results, and even after they were published, anyone who wanted to leave for a research stay or a congress, would need to put in the application a month (in bold) before the event.

It was frustrating, but mostly just tiring.

My flatmate has just came in. I had thought about cleaning, mopping the floor of the kitchen. "The apartment is disgusting". What's the point now.

I went out and said hi, mentioned, too, how the girl never really came. "Oh yeah, they all said they would come when I were here". Thanks for the heads-up.

In the cafe I commented about the just received e-mail, moments after I instantly forwarded it to Eduardo.
"It's like they don't want anyone to actually go". No, it looks like they don't. I received a message in Telegram from Ed. "I saw the e-mail. They are dumb. Look, let's just postpone it a month and a half or two". He later corrected himself "Just schedule it as close to when you're going to present your thesis as possible".

There were so many wrong things with that. I am leaving in less than two weeks. It's impossible to rent something for less than three months, even then it's hard, going for two or one... My next endocrinologist appointment will be around May, I can't postpone it that much. My thesis, my exam... I won't be presenting them any time soon. I don't have any news about my degree.

I just wrote an OK and finished my meal.

And my beer.

The guy would send his friend for the furniture around 8pm. When I got to the house I put the stuff on the desk away and took it out of the room. I did took the table off the legs and left everything in the living room.

He did come and took the stuff away. He paid me in cash and my room looks empty now. Lifeless.

Like I, on the inside.

Around 10 I sent a message to Catherine saying that they had taken the furniture. She replied this morning.

I asked Monica to proofread my CV. I did finish it lastly. She said to remove the Honors and Awards part, 'nobody really gives a shit'. Except she's wrong. It's an academic CV, it's the only part that all of the examples shared.

This morning she sent me a message before Catherine. It said she was envious of my CV.

I ignored it just like I ignored the other one. "Where are you going to move?"

I explained about the Airbnb and my not knowing of March. She kept asking. But why am I leaving? Couldn't I just stay here? Is it rented already? I kept explained and even once said I didn't want to talk about it. 'It's like I just talk about the bad stuff of my life with you', 10 minutes later I told her how I am not comfortable here, my flatmate makes me uncomfortable and I hated that she told her friends about me being trans.

Of course she did not answer. Probably won't until tomorrow.

Almost every day since we've talked I have told myself I would let the conversation die. Just today I won't say anything, send anything.

Will my flatmate mop the kitchen floor? She would have another reason for thinking I am a slob. She's better without me. Everyone probably is.

There was a dinner party at the house of the boyfriend of Omar, from CONAPRED. I hadn't realized until I received a notification in Facebook. I should go tomorrow to Yaaj. Even if just so I can leave the house.

I want to sleep, though. Although I won't be able to if they come see the room.

"Do yourselves a favor and go outside to see the moon" she tweeted with a heart.

Go fuck yourself.

## 2019-01-20

I didn't want to get up from the bed. I had the alarm a quarter before 11. Yesterday I could not sleep. I posted a tweet at 4 in the morning "I don't know which are worse, the nightmares that wake me or the thoughts that don't let me sleep". I exchanged a couple of messages with my mum. I'd be lying if I said I did not check if Catherine were online. With Monica I did not exchange any message all weekend. The last one was on Friday, she said she'd been meaning to talk but had been very busy at work. She had notices about Rodrigo, he had sent her a friend request on Facebook. That was it.

Maleny came in the evening and then left. Around 8 I went into bed but did not sleep. I heard sounds, and imagined her mopping the floor of the kitchen, what I had the intention of doing, maybe reducing a little the image she has of me of a dirty lazy fuck. Now, again, she cleaned.

I heard the sound of the door and stayed in bed. I put another episode of whatever I was watching. When I went to the restroom I even saw the clean floors in the dark. Later in the night I heard her return with a friend. They went into her bedroom. She didn't stay the night, though. She left after midnight.

In the morning, I finally got up at 11 and showered. I felt the beginnings of the symptoms again, but nothing happened this time. I shaved. I put on my clothes and got ready. My flatmate left moments after that. Before leaving I went into the kitchen and realized the floors weren't spotless. Nobody mopped them. I blamed myself and drowned in guilt for something that didn't happen. I mean, sure, she sure thought the apartment is disgusting, but whatever.

"How was your Family Sunday? What did you do?" I thought about sending but decided against it. I took my laptop and my backpack with me. After the conference I could go to the usual cafe and work for a while. Eduardo sent me a recent paper of predicting the effectiveness of rTMS with neuroimage.

I stopped to eat near Yaaj. They took really long before bringing me my food. While I was waiting I saw a shadow approaching. When I looked up, I recognized Sofia. She asked me if I weren't going to the group. I nodded and explained I was just eating before.

I got 40 minutes later. I only stood for a little more than half of the session and yet it was exhausting. I dreaded my turn and what I would be saying. I didn't want to make mention of my dark moment nor my anxiety, nor the problems in the apartment or the conversations with Catherine, I didn't want to remember the streak of bad moments in Tijuana. I didn't want to share. And I didn't care about their problems.

The talk wasn't for me, either. I took my phone and opened the maps to see where was the cafe. It wasn't more than 3 minutes, when the speaker approached me and asked if everything was alright. No, nothing is. "Yeah". "You are distracting me, could yo turn it off?". Fuck.

Now I had to pay attention. Now I was embarrassed as shit and felt all eyes on me. It didn't help that no less than three times I clenched my soul so tears would stop flowing through my eyes.

"They took the women to Jesus. She was accused of adultery. The laws of Moises stated that she ought to be stoned. Either Jesus approved and then all his talk about love and forgiveness was horseshit, or he would deny the law of god. It was the only moment in the bible were it's stated that he knew how to write. He wrote something on the sand, but it blew and we don't know what it was. Everybody read it and he said: 'If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her'". That was a story I knew before, like all of his talk. Little bits of data that I've gathered from the internet or previous talks. But the next was what broke me.

"Everyone let the stones fall and left. He went unto her and told her 'See, woman, who is accusing you?', she looked up and said, 'no one'. 'I am not accusing you either. Stop accusing yourself'".





## 2019-02-02

/It's been almost two weeks since I wrote in here. I don't live in Fuentes Brotantes anymore. January is finally over. Catherine and I keep occasionally exchanging messages with the burden of initiating on my shoulders. I had a fight with Monica. I've been going out more with friends. Karen, Sofia, Eliseo. I flirted and for an instant believed that I don't necessarily will end up alone. I am on medication again. Just moments ago I applied the estrogen shot to myself.

I stopped writing because of depression. I thought it was different, maybe it was anxiety. The psychiatrist disagreed. It's more depression than anything else. He prescribed a benzodiazepine anyway. Maybe it would be a way to force me to stop drinking. It didn't. I know is dangerous to mix alcohol and them, and yet yesterday I both drank, smoke weed and took my prescribed drops of calm.

What was first? Yeah, the finale of Steven Universe. Sofia invited me to watch it in her house with Eliseo. We talked before seeing the special episodes. I narrated the what-happened of the Christmas party. Sofia told us about her ex. Eliseo about his own and the conflict with his supposed-friends. I was glad I actually went. The episode ended on a theme of accepting yourself, loving yourself.

I asked Catherine about Anahi, about the tweet she had later deleted. Or at least that was my intention. It ended up badly. Again she repeated how it was uncomfortable to her that I had looked her up. She was her friend first.
She didn't want me to talk about it, at least with her. She sees her as Miguel or Vania, people outside of the group that we share.

It hurt in a way different than what I would had imagined. I remembered the entry of when Anahi had told me I could be her best friend. I was so excited of having someone else beside my current partner. What really happened that we stopped talking then? "You ghosted her completely, and don't deny it".

Did I?

And then it was the other thing. We were in her car outside my house when she confessed how she felt sad and guilty. She kept talking how she was lonely and had suddenly realized that she had Miguel or Vania while I had only her. I had nobody to talk with and there she were complaining about loneliness when I should had felt way worse.

It was one of the few moments that I remember actually feeling better with what she said. Although it hurt to hear it from her, I felt understood.

"I do know that, really, all of our friends were yours first" I said but went ignored and or unanswered.

The conversation continued, but I couldn't stop thinking that there is no point.

Today is L's birthday. I sent them a message in whatsapp. It's the anniversary of my coming to the city, two years ago. In four days it's Catherine's birthday. I had thought about sending her an audio message around the time I was expecting hers on my birthday. In my mind none of this would be happening: the occasional superficial conversations, my checking her social media, being jealous and insecure about her finding somebody else.

There was a tweet she posted recently in her first day of this semester of college. "What did I do to deserve this?" Anahi and her chilean friend both replied. The former said "You stopped talking to me because of a broad!, nah, I'm joking, relax, it's just a bad streak". I blocked Anahi, so I had to went straight into her profile to read that. The answer was "I didn't stop talking to you! ...we just went out less. I'M SORRY"

I read those messages and compare them to ours and they're so different it hurts. The past will never come back, and yet I keep worrying about that supposed women, about her going out with somebody else. Is it because I don't want to be replaced or, as Paola asked, in a way I want her back? Or is it because I fear I will end up alone?

She went with Anahi to Big bear. Anahi has a profile picture in her Facebook similar to Catherine's. Why do any of this matters?

I kept using both Tinder and Bumble. Nothing has come out of those. I reply to some messages and get new ones now and then, but, then what?

The last one was this girl, Roxana, she's a barista and in our messages actually mentioned how we had a good start. She read my bio and in hers she said she was pansexual. "So this means we won't answer back?!" said once.

Now she hasn't answered, just like all of the hundred women I have talked in the apps.

Another was from Tijuana. We actually matched there and then she just didn't answer my message asking about books. I came back to the city, and apparently, so did she. We matched in Bumble and she asked me if I was from Tijuana, because as a matter of fact so were she. We talked for a while, I mentioned the feminist meeting I went to with Sofia and she talked to me about her friend coming to the city. The last that happened was how I found her on Twitter and told her I hesitated before following her, as my own feed embarrases me. She didn't answer and I followed her anyway. That was the end of it.

Mariana, one of the girls who reads me on Twitter, said several comments about being worried about what I post. When I told Sof about that, she agreed and said that she was there if anything were happening with me. Maybe I should back a little down on the depressing shit I post.

After the Steven Universe finale, there was Danny's birthday celebration in a place of Mezcal. "Dulce Maguey".

That was the day I had the argument with Monica. I had sent her a picture of my outfit and she critized the undone buttons on my blouse. They looked thrashy, was her reason. I explained I had just buttoned it for the picture but the conversation kept going about that. It wasn't sexy. I don't know what it clicked but it just made me think how I am not sexy. No matter what I do, how I dress or act, nobody finds me attractive. Who in their sane judgment would want to be with someone as ugly and broken as me?

"Talk to me when you get rid of that nasty attitude" she finally said when I was on the metrobus.

Moments later, when I was walking to the destination, I waited for the green stick figure to appear and give the right of pass. Suddenly it did, but my feet did not move. I stood there confused for an instant, when a huge red figure furiously passed just inches in front of me.

"Why didn't I step forward?" I would later post. "I thought it was something suicidal would tell me Sofia the next day after exiting Olivia's house and I told her and Elisea what had happened.

The night in Dulce Maguey was nice. I really enjoyed myself. The conversation flowed. Most of us had a good time. Sofia took out Piccollo, the game I had played once in an old apartment with Karen's friends. This time a challenge appeared. Every time that I spoke, I had to give a compliment to Paty.

Months before, when we went to Aldo's party, I had been with her. I wanted to be close to her. I even told Monica about this "crush" I had. We talked for a while but then it just fade away as I realized she was not really interested. Or so I thought.

It all started clumsily and shyly. At first I avoid talking so I would not have to say anything. Then they started to come out naturally. By the end of the night, I even said them after the challenge had ended. Everyone was amused, and I even stopped caring if she were not comfortable. She didn't look uncomfortable, actually she seemed to enjoy them.

Just before she left we were actually flirting. But she left.

The next day was the Feminist gathering. I would see Sofia there and, after that, we would gather at Olly's with Eliseo for brunch. Instead of brunch, it was beers. Eliseo walked with me to the bus stop, and I shared with him that I'd be going to the psychiatrist that week. He was near his college, which was actually really close to his house. We should go eat before. It was a plan. And so we did.

One day, in the lab, Eduardo asked me what were my plans after the master. "You do have plans, don't you?" We've been working on the paper we will publish to accompany his grant proposal. I have actually been very busy. My own paper is still untouched and unmodified.

He said there was the option of going straight to the doctorate in UNAM. If I were interested we should be reviewing that options now. I was not really interested. For that I would need to graduate on time and by now I am completely convinced it won't be possible. I said nothing about the bachelors papers and just left it at that.

There were other options, too, and that's when he said that if they gave him the money he could hire post-docs, doctorate students or research assistants. Maybe he could hire me.

I was relieved, it was what I've always been waiting for, to someone to offer me a job. And just then I remembered Zayra inviting me to their field trip to San Quintin just to later not mention it again. Would this happen, too?

Almost a month has passed and there is no news about the money for my research visit. I hate this not knowing. In less than a week I'll have my meeting with the endocrinologist. I will have to ask him to postpone our next meeting, without even knowing if I'll actually go to Maryland.

In March I'll receive the results of Rome and probably about Seattle, too. Probably I'll get accepted for the former, but the latter I really doubt it.

Catherine still has her plans of going to NYC. Next year she wants to travel with Miguel. Most nights I just want to sleep and not wake up.

Eduardo's talk was the night before of the psychiatrist. I met with Eliseo outside his university and we ate burgers. We stopped a while in his house before I went to see the dr. I talked. I said things I really didn't want to. I confessed to the alcohol, the smoking and the drugs, but made no mention of my cutting. He prescribed me sertraline and clonazepam.

I woke up today shaking from the effects of mixing the latter with alcohol. A part of me wanted them to be worse. Something to happen. Maybe Sof and Mariana were right in being worried. Maybe I should delete Twitter.

The next day of my meeting with the dr, I met with Karen to leave my stuff at her house and she accompanied me here to meet the hosts and bring my luggage. We went to Perisur after to window shop, bought wings and watched a movie at her house.

Yesterday I went to the lab, there were two patients for MRI. I could not work in anything. Viviana had to leave and so I accompanied Brenda for the cognitive testing. All my morning went there. I ate with Said and Diego. I hear Said said something about me. "Sofia looks very" blank. I was paying and when I caught up with them I even asked "I what?", but my words went ignored. I said nothing more.

I was wearing the blouse of my birthday but instead of leggings, I had tights. The pseudo-dress was extremely short, just barely covering my butt on the right side. Maybe it was about that. Diego, on the other hand, since I got there, mentioned how I looked different. Maybe taller, but not that... "Well she's wearing heels", said Said. But it wasn't that either, I have worn them before. Later, when we were eating, they mentioned how Ale had been insinuating herself to me, but I said nothing. Didn't I like her? I said sure, but not that much to actually had done something. In truth, I was just nervous about her not being lesbian, or worse, her being one and me being rejected because of my condition. I disguised that feeling saying that, if she were to say something again I would totally reciprocate, but just once, nah. "You don't want to leave it that easy to her" said one of them. And then Diego added that he liked my attitude, I was really different.

I grabbed my mug of beer, and ironically said "thanks to stop drinking".

I was late to the event. I got off the wrong station and walked here. I left my stuff, applied some make up and then leave. I accidentally left the door open. Thankfully the dogs are trained and neither of them left the apartment. I hope nobody noticed but the guard that came looking.

The metro was slow and I almost ran to the museum. Everything turned out OK. All of us were just in the entrance waiting for our queue to give our speeches and deliver the awards.

I took off my sweater and hung it on my purse. I would not come up with them, so I put them on the handle of the door that never opened way in the back. I greeted most of the people there. Paty was the first one I looked, but nervously I just waved instead of kissing her in the cheek.

She went before me. I had helped her by message to write her speech, but she gave another one. I don't remember if I made a mention of it when she came back.

I went up, waited for Chris to give his and just read from the card that was given to me, before handing the mask to Geraldina. Later people would congratulate me on my participation, as if none had noticed I had half-assed it. Was it Demian or Edgar or Josue, the one who actually liked how I had appropriated the podium, reclining on it to read from the card as if I didn't give a damn.

I came back and went for my purse just where Paty were. I raised my arm for it and she mistook my gesture for a hug. I didn't explain anything but I think she noticed. We talked for a while. And then later for the rest of the evening.

The rest of the ceremony we were near the other door, close to each other. She reclined her head on my shoulder. I put my arm around her a couple of times. Most of the ceremony we spent it in that dance of getting closer and then pulling away for a bit.

I didn't want to seem that desperate or into her, so sometime I would just leave and went around greeting people. "You sometimes just left" "...but I always return to you, don't I?" I kept on with the game. Most noticed.

Once she even told me "Why don't you hug me anymore".

Was it all just a continuation of the game? Did I expect something out of it all? Sex is out of the question. Just as it were with Helena 5 years ago. Was I just hoping for a kiss. Those hugs and contact is, honestly, what I missed the most. And yet again, I kept hugging Edgar, Eliseo and others. Why doesn't it feel the same?

We were in the tables and she actually asked me for a picture, "For Instagram?" When I accepted, she replied "are you sure?" Why wouldn't I be?

When we were outside and kept on with the gestures, she finally confessed "No, only because they'd hit me. Were I single I would totally said yes, Sofi"

And just as easy as it began, it finished.

"Not even my ex talked to me that way", she had said before. Did she ever mention a partner? Had she done so, would I had stopped?

She left and I agreed going to the after-party. Sof later made mention of what happened but we didn't talk that much 'oh yeah, just recently she had said she weren't single anymore".

I left and came home.

Today I sent a message to everyone. Catherine replied as if all had went well with her. I made no mention of her tweets. I asked a follow-up question but it went ignored. Maybe she's working, maybe she just doesn't care.

I told Monica how I had given my injection and she said she was extremely proud of me. She seemed, off. Extremely cheerful in a suspicious way. She kept calling me sofi. By the end, she said she would leave the phone.

I sent a message to the barista of tinder, but didn't really expect an answer.

And another one to Sonny, the last lone survivor of my Tinder matches. A plan is being formed in there, but will it actually come to happen? We talk about a bottle of wine and how her Thursday seems kind of free. I have therapy that day, but after 5, I am game.

I got into Instagram and saw the picture that Paty posted in her stories. I reacted to it and she continued in the chatroom. "You did see it" "Well, of course".

I told her how I left my purse on Ivan's room but he went in with his guy. "I didn't know he had a boyfriend" "Neither did I... well his boyfriend of the night".

"And with whom did you hook up?"
"Nobody, you were my girl of the night."

## 2019-02-03

Will I try again to continue with this shit?

I guess I could mean it in different ways.

Yesterday I gave myself the shot. I told Monica. I sent different messages to all sorts of people. Most answered. Some conversations continued. But then, what?

Today I didn't want to wake up. I could had gone up, gotten ready and left for the group of Yaaj. I decided against it in the end. I thought maybe Pat would go. Probably she wouldn't but Sof would. Eliseo surely would be there. I could see him or them, talk to them. Have a good time.

I stayed in bed and didn't get up until after noon.

The question I sent to Catherine remained unanswered. A conversation about the superbowl appeared in the group of the university. She answered there. I wasn't angry. Months before I would had been. Was I disappointed? It's to be expected, I guess. Is it cruel? To have me look her up and intentionally ignore me. In the end I guess it is all my fault for playing the game.

I sent another message telling of my shot. No arguments, no complaints, just another message. It's unanswered, too. 10 minutes later she replied immediately to one of Paola in the group. Will I ever learn?

I decided against continuing any conversation with Pat. Nothing will came out of it. I really enjoyed the contact, the hugs and flirtation. But I was rejected in the end, sweetly but rejected nonetheless. She has someone. And that is totally fine.

I had two conversations in Tinder, but they will probably amount to nothing. One of them actually said her first intentions of the app were to get a third person for a threesome with her boyfriend. The other one doesn't seem that interested.

I started some plans to see Sonny Thursday. We talked about a bottle of wine and a chat. I was free after my therapy session around 5. Maybe it was around her location. Will it happen? Do I want it to happen?

I sent a message to Monica asking her if she were busy. Yesterday she seemed oddly nice, but ended the conversation abruptly. I wanted to tell her about what happened. I wanted to talk about the night in the museum, how I don't know if I am ready, and yet I enjoyed it like never before.

Instead we talked about the superbowl, before the conversation died.

I slept in the afternoon. I have lots of things to do, both of my own project and the things Eduardo asked me to do. I don't feel the energy to do any of them. I had thought about taking my laptop and going to that coffee place in Condesa after the group.

Thursday will be my appointment with the endocrinologist. It will be the first week of February and still there are no news about the funds for my trip to the NIH. I actually fear it will have to be cancelled. I won't be accepted to either Rome nor Seattle. My degree will still be trapped in bureaucracy and this whole semester will be a disaster.

Will I always be alone? "Were I single I would say yes, Sofi, totally yes"

I hate reading myself like this. I hate myself like this.

I could just go out to the kitchen for a glass of milk to take the drops of clonazepam and sleep again. I feel nervous about seeing the hosts. I haven't really talked to them since Thursday when I got here. I guess I am waiting for them to go to sleep so I could go outside. Why do I hide in my room? Why do I hide inside my head?

I should had gone out.

I should had done many things differently.

I want to drink. I feel like mixing alcohol and the medicine. Said warned me, when I told him I felt tired and sleepy. "Maybe you should order a coke". I ended up drinking two more glasses of wine in the evening and took the full dosage at night. A part of me wanted something to happen. A part of me wants something to happen.

Was it reckless to prescribe me benzodiazepines? I did deny having suicide ideation. Why did I lie?

Do I really want to die?

What the fuck do I really want? What am I waiting for? What do I expect from all of this?

Where am I going?

Where am I? Who am I?

## 2019-02-04

Another day. I don't feel like writing. Nothing much has happened since the last entry.

I feel this urge of contacting people, reaching out. But it's not like last time. It's not friends or fraternal intimacy I am looking for. Monica warned me, told me not to contact Pat again. "If she reaches out to you, don't play her games". I didn't listen. Of course I didn't.

I got out of bed with difficulty around 2 in the afternoon. Was there a message from Catherine or was it yesterday? I remember talking about the shot. She replied like an hour later that she didn't know if she dared herself, maybe if it were necessary. The conversation was short and cold. It hurt more than its absence.

It was yesterday. Today I saw a notification with her picture and name of it, except it wasn't to me. It was to the group. Was it really yesterday? Yeah. The same thing happened. I had send a message that she ignored and instead she replied to Paola's inquiry about the Candelaria's gathering. I then sent the other one and later she answered that. Today it was to follow up with the memes about the superbowl. I tried to ignore the messages but couldn't. I just didn't answer. Paola knows I need a space from all of them.

I answered back to some messages from the dating apps. To one I even asked out for coffee. When it came time to set up the date she backed up. With Sonny I left it open for Thursday, maybe tomorrow I'll ask to confirm. She'll probably back out, too.

Monica sent me a message this time. I don't remember the start, something about her having finished what she was doing. Then she continued herself saying how yesterday she had thought about me, when they were leaving Chula Vista Center and saw the sign of 5 Guys.

I went to 5 Guys the first time with Catherine. It's been years since I've gone there with her. All of the rest of times it was with my family. Some of the cashiers even remembered me. Monica prefers Fuddruckers. I have only gone there once, with Catherine and Anahi. "You ghosted her. And don't deny it... She was my friend first".

I was the one who continued the conversation with Pat. I saw the rest of the pictures of Friday that were just recently uploaded. There was one of her entering the podium to give her speech. I screencapped it and sent it to her. I know she doesn't have Facebook.

"You remembered" she said, before the conversation started. Were there more flirting? Now I don't have the plausible deniability of not knowing she's with someone, or unavailable. Now if I get hurt it will totally be my own fault.

Yesterday before I fell asleep I keep thinking about her getting closer to me around the door, and the feeling of her head on my shoulder. "Why aren't you hugging me anymore?"

Is that what I want from the girls I keep messaging in those other apps?

Aliza sent me a message asking if everything were the same with the research residency. There were no news on her part, were she expecting me to had sent a message asking for information or were she just wanting to talk with me? She knows I am a lesbian. "Your appearance on my twitter has been one of the best things that has happened to my feed in the last months (end of the statement)" Is she? Does she know I am transgender?

Doesn't everyone?

The day after tomorrow is Catherine's birthday. The last I thought about that was sending her an audio message. For a while I thought about a short video one, but maybe that is way too personal. I had tomorrow to decide.

The day after that I have my appointment with the endocrinologist. I will have to ask him to postpone our meeting to June. Even though I have no idea when will I end up going to Maryland. Or if I will.

Days keep passing by and I have not made any progress to my own paper. The manuscript should be finished and sent before March. There are other papers I need to fill and send, one to get the signature of Israel, ask Dardo and the NIH to sign other two letters with the updated dates, and the other deal with the scholarship.

The drops are helping, sure, but is there really that much of a difference?



## 2019-02-05

I told Monica I am taking sleeping meds. She was surprised at first. I thought I had mentioned I had made an appointment with the psychiatrist. I guess I did not. I did not mention the depression, and even just kind of passed over the anxiety. She's been a little different, more caring.

Today I received a message from Roxana, the girl from Tinder. I thought I would not hear from her again. She answered my question about the long weekend saying it was tired. Her response was dry and short. Maybe it will be the end of it. I playfully said I had thought she had forgotten about me or were taken by the po-po. I hope she gets the reference to the slang and doesn't think I was making an scatological joke. It really doesn't matter, I guess.

I was in the lab when I received a message from Sonny. She asked about Thursday. I, too, had thunk about asking her myself. We started drafting the plans after I left the office. I ate with Said. Eduardo told us, in confidence, how is now a sure thing he's leaving for Queretaro. We talked for a couple of minutes. Alehly, is that her name?, finally came to the office. She's starting now. After everybody left, she started chatting with me. She asked about Yaaj and complimented my hair. Does she know I am trans?

Catherine changed the picture in her whatsapp. It's her sitting on a trunk with a snowball on her hand ready to be thrown, snow on her red sweater and a fake smile drawn on her face. We haven't really talked lately. The last message she answered was superficial, and even before that I felt she wasn't telling the whole truth. I guess we are strangers now.

In twitter she's been posting now and then how things aren't going her way. She looks fatter. I see her pictures and feel both less attraction and a nostalgic longing of what used to be.

Tomorrow is her birthday. I recorded myself in my bed congratulating her. I looked at myself in the recording in loop. The video played at least 10 times before I stopped it. There is something in my eyes. They are sad and melancholic. She will notice. Will she care, though?

A part of me fears she will resent me doing that, as if it were some kind of stunt.

Was it?

I liked how I looked in the video. I am thinner. My face is softer. Even though my hair is tied up behind my head and I was misgendered in the supermarket, I saw myself feminine. I smile, I congratulate her and wish her the best, but my eyes don't lie. Maybe it's not that good of an idea.

Thursday I have my appointment with the endocrinologist. I will get my results of the blood lab. What if I am anemic or have problems with my kidneys or liver? I guess I'll know by then. I am thinner but that doesn't mean I am healthier. Should I mention my going to the psychiatrist?

Tomorrow I have to go to UNAM to meet with Israel and get his signature for the form of the fourth test. I had a meeting with Ruth at 10 to fix some errors in the databases. "Let's see what Sofia found NOW in the databases".
After that I guess I'll be leaving to meet with Israel. Then I am free until 6 to meet with Sonny. We will go to this pizza place. The date was supposed to be Thursday, but my appointment with Faust was at 5, not 4 in the afternoon. We changed it to tomorrow instead.

Am I nervous? Not really. I don't really find her that attractive in her pictures. Is it wrong? Maybe she doesn't even see it as a date. Maybe is Pat all over again.

Sof sent a message to the group of the women of yaaj. She wanted to do a gathering in her house Saturday since we never really do the Candelaria's tamales. I was the first to agree. She jokingly said that it was perfect since I was the one who was supposed to bring the food. I was also that person in the gathering of the group in Tijuana. They will mix the occasions with Catherine's party for her birthday. Just as the King's cake and my birthday were mixed. Although my birthday part was kind of forgotten.

I made some stupid comment after Pat said something. Sof said she was enjoying seeing that. Was she there when Paty declared she was with someone? "Were I single I would say yes, totally yes, Sofi". I told her in the after-party. Nobody replied to my comment saying I would behave. The conversation went elsewhere. I hope the gathering does take place. I would really like seeing them. I would really like seeing her again.

Ana sent me a message yesterday. I remember fantasizing being invited to give a conference in my faculty and she did just that. Some students of her are organizing this sort of encounter for LGBT people and she told them about me and what I am doing her in the city. She was wondering if they could contact me to agree to a conference or a workshop.

I have to know what will happen with my research residence for that.

Angel said that all of the research visits were approved, including mine. Maybe I won't need to send the solicitation again with a month of anticipation. I should inquire about that. Soon.

## 2019-02-10

I've been grown accustomed to not do the words. Is it the tiredness? The medication, maybe? I didn't take neither my hormones nor the psych meds yesterday. I didn't sleep here last night. Lots of things have happened this past week. Wednesday was Catherine's birthday. I sent her a video message congratulating her and giving her my best wishes. I don't know for how long it remained unseen, but she didn't answer it until the next evening. She did send a message the next morning to the group of the gang about her party. I was really angry at her, as if she owed it to me to respond. When she finally did, it wasn't enough. I guess the issues are all on my end .

Wednesday was also the day of my first date. I went out with Sonny, I waited for her by the pizzas and chatted for all of the afternoon. It was nice, I had fun, but there was something that made me feel uneasy. It was Catherine's birthday and I never could not stop thinking about that. Did I wanted her to know in some way, in any way, that I was on a date? That I was seeing someone? That distracted me from being there with Son, and it made me feel guilty. I talked about it the next day on my session with Faust.

In the morning I went to the endocrinologist. There is still a shortage of medication, so he didn't prescribe me the estrogen pills. He offered me to give me a prescription for a month and then refill it. But I said I would, hopefully, not be in the country by then. Luckily I have a stock of two months of those pills.

When I mentioned about my date to Faust, I started crying. I didn't really know why. By the end of the session, when he asked if there was anything else I would want to talk about, I mentioned how the day before was Catherine's birthday. He made notice of how it remained unsaid until the very end and asked me if I wanted to continue it. I said no and the session ended.

That night I took the first complete pill of the antidepressant. The next morning I sent a message to Eduardo telling him I had a migraine and would not go to the lab. He was nice about it and just wished me to get well. I was just too much depressed to get out of bed. I stayed until the afternoon, with just enough time to get ready for the meeting of Yaaj.

I didn't expect Paty to be there. I had thunk I would see her the next day, Saturday, at Sof's house for the gathering. At first she stayed next to me, but then Bertha asked me to switch places. Even though later I would move closer, we didn't talk much. I sat next to Sof in the red couch. The meeting went as planned and the four of us, Emiliano, Eliseo, Sof and me went to dinner. We ate Arepas, venezuelan food.

Emiliano will have a farewell/birthday party next Friday. The theme is Asia. We agreed to go out Sunday, today, to look for our outfits in Chinese downtown. I ordered an uber before they went to their party of Colmex.

In those days I orchestrated another date with Sonny. Saturday's meeting was cancelled, so the idea of going out for breakfast came up. By the end we agreed to meet in the Comedor Lucerna. The place Francisco had talked about near his house. We went there for lunch around 2pm. We ordered a burger and a couple of beers. At first it was just like the first time. Conversation and just mild flirting. After the second beer I was already buzzed. The place was packed so we moved to a different place, one just of beer. We ordered two more each.

I kept teasing how she wanted to get me drunk and she pretended to order more. By then I already started stroking her leg with mine under the table. At one point I felt her move herself closer. When I parted my leg a little she said "Don't put it away, it feels really nice"

She had a gathering of her office and I had mine at Sof's. I walked her to the metro. I hugged her when she started trembling. Inside the wagon, when we sat, I put my legs between hers. For a moment she moved her hand from her own knee to mine. Not much later she put it away. We changed lines and I was just next to her, with my hand on the bar behind her lower back. I wanted to kiss her. I thought I would when we would say good-bye. I didn't. I did not dare. I don't really know why. She just left. She sent me a message asking about if I had gotten there a little later.

I walked to Sofia's. A man, just a couple of blocks before arriving, started talking to me. He said how he noticed this other man looking at me weirdly, getting closer and then further away. He offered to walk with me, and asked me to be more aware. I had forgotten about that.

When I got to the building, there were only men and Sof. Emiliano, Eliseo, Misael and Diego. When the friends of Sof of the parlament arrived, at first there were two separate groups of parties. One of women and one of men. I was in the wrong one, I guess.

Later things went smoother. I kept seeing Jessica's IG stories about the night in Tijuana at Catherine's. I really liked the skirt she was wearing. She looked nice. I missed her and felt this bothering nostalgia and melancholy. I tried not to get too much distracted by it. I had another date, I had had a really good time. I was having a good time. There was no point in thinking about any of them. I still look for a stranger at Catherine's party by her side. Not finding one wasn't as relieving as I would had thunk.

I had thunk that would be the end of the night, having my date, the grazing of the idea of a kiss. I ended kissing more people then than I had in my whole life. I kissed Eliseo, Emiliano, Ytza, and Sofia.

We played never have I ever. And surprisingly I had done something not a single person had done. I talked about the time I had sex with Monica at the movies. The time we literally lied down on the seats and didn't watch the complete second half of the movie. Like water for elephants. Something like that.
We played then "Dare" like truth or dare, but without the truths. First they asked me to kiss the person which I wanted the most. I kissed Ytzel. It was a couple of seconds. The first kiss I have had in a year. I would had thought it would be with my date. Then they dared me to kiss two people at the same time. I kiss her again with Sof. The third time, it was 7 minutes in heaven, we went to the bathroom with the lights off and kissed again. The three of us. It's the closer I've gotten to a threesome. I liked it. I really did.

After that, nothing. Sof and her really hit it off. They slept together and then shared tweets about liking each other. For a little while I felt disappointed and rejected. As if it cancelled out all of what I had enjoyed. Maybe that's what Catherine had said about not being able to be in a threesome. She would feel left out. I was just an accessory to their making out. Except it wasn't. Both kissed me and I kissed them both. And by the end, the only thing that matters is that, in the moment, I really enjoyed it.

This morning, Eli and I went to bellas artes. We had breakfast and then looked around the festival of the new year's in chinese downtown. I found the dress. I sent a message to Monica, to Pat and to Son. All of them answered. Pat's conversation died pretty quickly with obvious reasons. Monica, at first, was excited about what had happened, and then disappointed I had drunk and then judgemental about it. By the end, she ended up supportive again. Son's conversation just keeps going. We are talking right now.

There are conversations in Bumble and Tinder. I know I could set up a date with at least two women in those apps, and yet I don't feel like it. Not now. Do I want to see Son again? Why do I keep thinking of asking her out? I am a little nervous about being seen to eager. We just saw each other yesterday. We played in our first date how we would see 8 months later, and the second how fast time had passed.

I did find her attractive this second time. I do find her attractive, do I?

The other girls in the other apps are more conventionally pretty. Why am I ignoring them? Why do I keep thinking about Catherine and her stupid skirt?
