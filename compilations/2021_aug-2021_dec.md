## August, 2021

### Sunday, August 1st, 2021
The last entry in this log is from February 10th, 2019.
In it, I talk about my first and second dates with Sonny.
That was more than two years ago.
We both started and ended a long-term relationship between then and now.
We are not speaking right now.
I told Monica how it was because... why was it, again?

I said it would be better for the both of us.
I don't really want to get back together and she keeps sending me suggestive
messages or making insinuations.
It hurts.

I've been hurting for a couple of months.
I might need to make an appointment with a therapist.
On that entry, I talked about my session with Fausto.
I miss that.
I think I need it.

I remember when, for some reason, I wanted to transcribe all of my electronic
journal entries to a physical notebook.
I would read the stuff about Monica from years before.
For days after that, I would feel depressed.
It was as if reading about that phase brought me back to that mental state.

I just finished writing about these last couple of days in my physical journal.
It feels good to write by hand, yet it might be a little easier to do them
in the computer.

I've been living here, in Montréal, for the last 7 months.
In this apartment, specifically, for 6 of those.
With both Armando and Alda, for the last 4.

It wasn't until last Friday that I came out to them.

"This is the first time that I hear you are gay", said Alda.

"Ve y salvate tú. Consíguete un québécois", said Armando,
even though I had just told them I like women not even 2 hours before.
As Kory said, straight people can be oblivious.

I mentioned to Armando our dinner and walk last night.
Meanwhile, Alda was getting ready for our roommate's brunch.
He asked me if I had gone out on a date.

"No, esa no es hasta la siguiente semana", I told him.

"¿Con quien?"

I waited before answering, even though I had been mentally rehearsing
how I would mention it to them both later today.
I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I still am not.

"...Molly."

I met Molly that same Friday, on the party to which Alda took us.
She was the second person to arrive after us,
just after a couple of francophone guys.
I don't remember how we were introduced.
I didn't drink that much, and yet I still feel as if I had.
There are things that I don't remember, feelings that I can't really identify.

When I saw her, there was something about her.
I don't think it was that I suspected she were gay.
She was telling us a story about this guy she went out on a date with,
he had _gasolina_ on repeat on his car's stereo.
She kissed him even though she is "as gay as they come".
No, he kissed her.
Or was that story about the 40 year old man?
I don’t remember anymore.

It was refreshing to see someone so freely open.
It's such a contrast to the time when I found Vicky's profile on Bumble.
Like her, though, I got fixated on Molly after knowing she was a lesbian.
I tried to be flirty with her—like with Paty—,
but I don't think I ended up doing anything special.

"Pero, sí estás chida? Bueno, o sea, de salud..."
"Simón, por lo pronto todo cool; en ambos sentidos."
"Pues sí, la verdad sí."

Sonny kept repeating to me during our last conversations how I _am_ attractive.
That anyone would be lucky to be with me.
Why, then, do I feel so insecure and undesirable?

I was glad that Molly decided to leave the party at the same time we did.
I felt fortunate that the metro had stopped an hour before our departure
from the party—even though it was unfortunate of her—as
she would need to walk back.

I don't think I actually considered asking her out.

"I'm really bad at identifying when someone is hitting on me",
I said out-loud with the full intention that she would hear me.

"Oh, I am like that", she exclaimed,
"a woman could be dancing naked in front of me and still I wouldn't realize it:
_she is such a good friend!_"

It wasn't until we split that the idea of being direct with her and
asking her out appeared in my mind.
How would I find her, though?
I didn't have her number nor her contact.

I was lying on my bed when I considered looking her up.
She was Vix's coworker: maybe he had her on his Facebook.
I looked in both Alda's and Vix's profiles.
It was too creepy, too much.

I followed Vix on Instagram, instead.
I wrote her name in the search bar and her picture came out.

I viewed inside her profile and closed it,
just like when I closed Bumble the first time Vicky came up holding her cat
and smiling.

I sent a message to Monica instead:

"Moni,
why do I keep falling for every woman who gives me the least bit of attention?"

She replied the next morning.
I told her about Molly and about Sonny.
She read me and encouraged me to send the message asking her out.
I sent her a draft.
No, too much, too formal.
Something more casual.

I followed her profile.
Even if nothing comes out of this, at least I'll have another friend in the city.
That is what I can't have with Vicky when nothing happened after I swiped right.
I ended up without any reason to tell her I know she's queer.

I had just written to her how I had followed Molly and sent her the message,
when I got the notification that Molly had accepted my request of following her
and had followed me back.
Instant's later, I got a new message.

I had reviewed in my mind all of the possible ways she could reject me.
Not the _possible_ ones where she'd be mean or insulting,
but the _probable_ ones.
None of these were her reply.

She had a great time as well, and would love to grab some coffee.

After some intermittent messages we agreed to meet next Saturday.
She is supposed to have gotten her vaccine today.
I'll be pretty busy with Neuromatch the whole week.
I wish I could see her sooner.

I keep thinking that she would not have agree were it a _real date_.

It's as if I had to have said some magic words for it to qualify as a date.
Or maybe it's just that I used a code instead that assured her this is
non-romantic.

When Kory invited me to grab some food,
I hesitated because I thought maybe he wanted a date,
even though I know he's gay.

Would that happen with Molly after she got my message?
Maybe it's the opposite and she read me with the same intention Kory had
when he asked me.

I have both the anxiety that it is not a real date,
and about what I should do if it, in fact, is.

Should I tell her I am trans?
Of course I should, but when?

How?

Not Saturday. Because it is not a real date.

_"Is this a date?"_

_"No, but it could be if you want"_

_"Would you have said yes if it were?"_

_"I guess not, if you have to ask that question"_

I am excited. I am nervous. I am sad.

### Monday, August 2nd, 2021
The summer course was harder than I thought it could be.
It's not so much the math or the coding.
I hate participating or raising my voice in front of a group of strangers.
Sometimes even after years of sharing a classroom, I'd still rather be quiet.

All of the Google Collab documents are for us to fill as a group.
Not only do I feel impatient when I finish first,
I also feel rushed and pressured by the rest.
I don't think I'm fully comprehending what I am doing.

I didn't mind as much the first part of the course
when we brainstormed ideas for our project.
No, there was a moment when I started to feel uneasy and frustrated.
The TA over-complicated the issue.
Everybody was being _too flexible_ with their preferences,
but that only made it harder to move forward.

It's the first of 15 days.
I don't remember when was the last time I felt this tired.

It might be because I didn't sleep very well.
I went to bed relatively early—before midnight.
I felt the need to keep writing about how I was feeling, what I was thinking.
It's not so much about telling the story.
It wasn't about expressing it, but more like I needed someone to read it.
I thought about starting a public blog.
Change the names, remove the messier and irrelevant lines and put it up on
the internet for the world to see.
It's not like it will be found and become viral.
I was sure that it would be months before I would have a single viewer.

I actually did it.
I cleaned yesterday's entry a little,
came up with some names for my roommates and friends,
and researched about the best place to publish something easily,
free and anonymously.
It was 2h while I kept deleting and restoring the blog.
Even at this moment, I'm not sure if it's up right now.

Fortunately, I didn't have much problem getting out of bed in the morning.
I showered even before Armando and made my coffee before the welcoming
ceremony at 8:30.

How many times did I re-read Molly's conversation
before the time I saw she was typing?
I imagined lots of ways she could have rejected me.
Did I think of the possibility that she would cancel on me?

She didn't.
She apologized about how she has a problem replying in Instagram,
and then asked if it was possible to do something Sunday instead.
She had this camping trip Friday and Saturday.

That's not what I told Monica, though.
I omitted the part where she proposed an alternative date.

"Well, I didn't say anything because you had already sent it,
but you kind of came up too strong..."

I knew she was right.

I also sent a stupid joke telling her not to get lost on the woods
and then offered her my phone number in case she preferred that.
After sending it, I worried if that was too much.
I guess it was?

I haven't gotten a response yet.
I hope I won't get another one until it's time to set up the details of the weekend.
If I do, I won't reply instantaneously.
The thing I wanted less was to play this kind of games where I pretend
I am not interested to avoid feeling vulnerable.
I guess that there is no middle ground with me.
Either I get fixated and obsessed, or I act distant and cold.

It always has happened, since Monica, to Catherine and even with Sonny.
I get fixated on them and then, when I am in a relationship,
I become this other person, to whom their feelings don't mean anything.
I didn't believe them anymore when they said I was attractive,
when they said they loved me.
Kissing or fucking would become a chore.
And then, just after the relationship finally ended, I couldn't get over them.

I told Armando as well that Molly had cancelled.

To him I did clarify that it wasn't really a date-date.
It was just coffee.
We were just going to hang out.
That's the reason she said yes.
That's why she would definitely like to grab a coffee.
Because it doesn't mean _anything_.

I wanted to talk to her, but I convinced myself that I wouldn't try to chat
until after we meet.
As if that were going to make any difference.
So, instead I replied back to the Tinder messages.
Suddenly after we had our plans, I didn't care about any of those girls.
I kept sending messages to Armando, to Monica.
I considered chatting up with Sonny.

The day was long and tiring.
I was really looking to write these words.
Even the e-mail from the woman from UNAM with the copies of my degree didn't
feel as relieving as it should.

I'm pretty sure I'll be so excited for a moment that either won't happen,
or won't meet my unrealistic expectations.

Whatever is going to happen will, I suppose.

### Tuesday, August 3rd, 2021
This was the second day of Neuromatch.
It went better than yesterday.
Fortunately, the tutorial pods were randomized so I ended up in a different
group of people.

Was it because of Rich rightfully correcting me after I said a stupid thing
that I felt uncomfortable?

This was the first time I've felt uncomfortable and that I could attribute it
to being a woman.
No, it also happened  while I was on Neurohackademy.
I can't really pinpoint the action that triggered that.

This time Era was in my group.
Did that have something to do with it?

I've been on hormones for more than 5 years and there is still a small voice
in the back of my head telling me that I have no right to talk about the issue
of women in STEM.
That I don't count as a 'real' woman.
Of course everyone notices my _transness_,
so it is an issue of sexuality rather than gender.
Will the voice ever go away?

Was it yesterday? No, this morning I received a text from Molly.
Again, she apologized about not replying in Instagram and affirmed me
she'd get back to me when she returns on Sunday.

Monica's words stayed in my head when I thought of a reply.
Acknowledge and move on.
Be as cold as possible.
I went back to my usual strategy of hiding my feelings and pretending
detachment and apathy.
I felt weird after that.

Hours later, she misunderstood my _What's up_ as a literal question and
told me she was working and asked me what I was doing.
I made a small joke about my 'intensive' course,
and intentionally made my message a simple answer that could put an end to
the conversation.

I was ready to leave it there and force myself to not open the conversation
anymore until she would get back to me to schedule.
I was telling just that to Monica, when I got a reply from Molly.

"oh, cool. What's the course about?"

I answered back, and she kept it going.

"What's your preferred beer?"

"So you don't really have as much of a sciences background, then?",
she continued still.

I was waiting for her to put her hands on my face to apply the temporal
tattoo on my forehead.
_Whatever it is, as long as you pick it_ and _my face is in your hands_
were some of the things I was preparing to say.
I don't think she ended up actually doing it, did she?

"Te ves hermosa", she said looking me straight in the eyes.

Why was it?
I think Alda had just put it on and she was showing off her Spanish.
Maybe it was just the _hermosa_.
I thought she was just playing.
Would Monica take it as another good sign?
I should stop bringing her up in our conversations.
I feel she is getting tired of it.

Yesterday I told Monica how I have been questioning my sexuality.

Other than the strange mild crush I had on Vicky,
I guess Molly is the first time that I have been interested in anyone since
Sonny.

It was during a video from Wisecrack.
The video was about men's health or something related to that.
I stopped watching since I lost interest halfway,
but, before that, I noticed something.
I saw the men differently than  how I used to.
It was the host and the series of men that kept appearing.
They looked big and muscular, and I felt... what exactly?
It was something between curiosity, amazement and desire.
A strange urge to be closer to them, touch their chest or being embraced.
It was strange.

Yet, not entirely new.

I told Monica and brought up the time with Francisco's friend,
our almost-kiss at Francisco's birthday party in his apartment.
We were dancing and I touched his chest and I wanted to be closer to him.
His hand moved through my back. I wanted so badly to kiss him.

"Oh, sí eres...", he whispered.

We didn't. I will never know what he was talking about.

I told her about the men I've kissed.
The kiss with both Ytzel and Sofía.
I've kissed someone with my own name.

_You picked your own name, it doesn't count_, tells me now that voice.

I guess Molly's conversation died for today.

I like her. Maybe a bit too much. This is how I get hurt.

I checked McGill's application dashboard and my degree appears now as received.

Even if our meeting goes great, it is not a date.
Even if it _is_ a date, there is still that huge elephant in the room.

### Wednesday, August 4th, 2021
We changed the plan. We are going to Thomson House today.
Armando asked us if we could it this afternoon instead of Friday.
At first Alda said she couldn't since she has a shift tonight.
In our own chat, I asked him if he was up to going just the two of us.
I need to go out, do something.
Is it just the course?
I feel exhausted and yet, at the same time, like I need a distraction.
From what, though?

Last night I had a dream about Monica.
There was another friend of hers.
We were all lying on a large bed.
Was it Monica's?
I was playing with her friend, teasing and flirting.
I moved away from her kisses, though.
Did I look like a guy?

I hate those kind of dreams.
There was something sexual in the dream but I can't really remember it.
I think the friend handed a vibrator to Monica.

I woke up around 7h, but I stayed in bed until early 8h
This time I didn't get up until I absolutely needed to.
I woke up with a faint hangover from yesterday's two beers.

No, it wasn't 7h, because I replied to Molly's last text 15 min before 7h.
I replied back even though I didn't really need to.
Like the one before, there were no questions to answer.
Somehow I felt the need to be to one who had sent the last message.
When I was in high school, with Monica's chats, I remember how I would not
send her a message if it was I who had started the conversation the day before.

She replied back even though I didn't ask any questions either.
We exchanged a couple more messages.
I guess I'll leave it like that until she gives me her availability for
the weekend.
Maybe that is why I want to keep busy.
It is barely the middle of the week and I feel so tired.

I thought about mentioning Molly again to my roommates while we were having dinner, but decided against it.

"I distrust anyone who likes IPAs", I told them.

Molly likes IPAs.

"I went out with this guy I met on Tinder", Alda was saying,
"he lives in the other building next to the park.
But I don't think I'll see him, he's too young for me.
I think he is 22 years old."

If someone were to read these words, how obsessed would I look?
It's not even a real date.

I mean, this is the first time that I am interested in meeting someone
other than Sonny.
My last date was with Sonny and we were together for two years.

I should keep looking for other people.
Those two girls from the apps didn't do nothing from me.
One of them offered to exchange discord usernames and I blew her off.
I don't even remember the conversation with the other one.

What is wrong with me?
How else am I supposed to meet people?

Let's say that this weekend plans don't go nowhere.
What will I do with this anxiety?

Today's day went quicker.
We had a meeting with our project TA.
He had a heavy accent and it was hard to understand him.
I feel like I am struggling a lot more with my own english.
Words getting stuck in my mouth and coming out clumsily.

I miss home.

The project is coming out nicely.
We read some papers and I didn't feel as stupid as I did the first day.
Some of the coding was harder;
I am sure there is a lot of stuff that is going over my head.
I am sure that I will learn a lot from these lessons.

I miss Nymi.

Armando's girlfriend is coming to Canada in a few weeks.
Did he struggle with my pronouns this evening?
For an instant I was surprised when Alda referred to me as she.
It's been happening a couple of times these past few days.
Maybe even weeks.
Why is that?
My levels are supposed to be good.
I have an appointment with the dr in two weeks.

Do I miss Sonny?

I think tomorrow I have an appointment with Louis.
I don't know if I should cancel him or not.
Maybe I could send him a quick message in Teams to see if we can postpone it.
Or maybe just notify my team that I'll be out for half an hour.

Monica is supposed to come later this year. I keep having dreams of her.

I just want this week to be over.

### Thursday, August 5th, 2021
Last night, after finishing my words,
I went back to read the entries from about 5 or 6 years ago.
I had just gone no-contact with Monica and I was figuring out my identity.
It feels weird reading my deadname being thrown out so non-chalantly.
How long ago since anyone has used it with me?
The last time I can remember is that visit to my father's sisters.
There was also that time Manuel replied to my Facebook comment
after his phone was stolen.
He corrected himself, but I still hated him for a while.

I just got a message from Sonny on Instagram.
This morning, I sent her a message in Signal, but she didn't receive it.
I thought at first that she might had deleted the app.
Later I remembered how she had posted that her phone died.

Reading how dramatic I was being with Monica's silence years ago
made me realize that there's no point in this kind of stuff.
I sent her another message in Instagram.
She asked how I've been.

"Tired", I said.

I got an e-mail from Rona Schwartz.
It said that they had received my proof of graduation,
thus my hold had been lifted.
It was a reply from the message I had sent a couple of weeks ago.
After her silence, I decided to just ask UNAM to send the digital copy.
I had already paid for the translation anyway.

And with that, it goes the last big worry I had coming here to Canada.
There is no hold anymore over my registration.
I am on Hormone Treatment with a canadian doctor.

I ate a bowl of cereal and a banana.
That and two beers is all that I had to eat for today.

I've lost count of how many times I've lost and gained weight.
I am not fat at the moment.
I am not at the weight that I wish I would be.

Monica criticized my English and now I feel self-conscious about it.

I like my roommate situation at the moment.
Just yesterday we went to Thomson.
Alda brought me with her to her friends gatherings.
I share a similar humour with Armando.
We leave each other messages on the fridge whiteboard.

Monica is right, though, and I told her so:
lately I've been feeling clumsy with my english.
It's hard to think of what I want to say and how to say it.
My pronunciation is also different.

What was the name of that secretary at the NIAAA?
She was surprised of why I didn't have an accent.
It wasn't just her.
For my TOEFL, I had a perfect score in the _Talking_ section of it.
It was _Writing_ where I sucked ass.

For the GRE something similar happened.
I don't know what to take from that.
At the moment I just thought that it was my essays skills that were subpar.
Now, I don't know.

With Neuromatch, the project is coming along nicely.
I had a good idea for our project and Adam seemed to like it.
Adam is this PhD student (or is he a post-doc?) in Washington that knows Ariel.
I met Ariel two years ago in Seattle when I went there for Neurohackademy.

I got an e-mail from a recruiter today inviting me to this job offer
for female developers.
At first I thought it was an automated message,
but, when I read it more attentively,
I realized it had my name and it mentioned how she was sending it because she
liked my profile.

Why is it that I don't believe it?

Nobody ever offered me any opportunities for jobs.
All of the other universities where I applied for grad school rejected me.

Neda sent me a message today asking about the export of ratings in my app.
Even though I have been avoiding doing any work,
I managed to fix both that bug and the broken cohort filtering this evening.

While I was coding, I felt like those dreams where I try to use a phone.
Like my mind tries so hard to do something but it gets stuck in a thought.
Even now I still feel a little drunk.

When Monica used to tell me I was attractive, I felt nothing.

It's happening again. I don't know how to put that thought into words.

I thought it was because I didn't want to be an attractive *man*.
When Catherine would say it, she meant she liked me, really, as man,
which would let her ignore my freakish nature.
When Sonny says it, I think how she likes me *because* I am trans.

I hate how I look.

I sent Monica this picture of me in the balcony saying
that there was a chair for her.
I looked at the picture and hated me so much.

It's been more than 5 years of changes, physical or otherwise,
and there are still some feelings that are exactly the same as those
described in the old esomentries from a previous life.

### Friday, August 6th, 2021
"Do you want to do something today?", Alda proposed me,
"We could go somewhere, maybe even that brewery you wanted to go to...
We can also ask Molly, she wanted to do something as well".

It took me a minute to get it.
I said yes again, and continued cooking my breakfast.
I could not sleep very well.
I was tired.
I turned around for most of the first middle of the night.

I don't think I can type the words.
I am high right now.

Around 2h I decided I would start my breakfast before the first project meeting.
I would get up and cook the eggs and sausages with fried tortillas
even before I would start with the coffee.

We are going to leave in around half an hour.
Alda and I are waiting for Armando to return home.
_Dieu du ciel!_ is the brewery of the beer I like the most here in Canada.

"Is it the one that is on Laurier Ouest?",
asked me Alda as she was texting with Molly.

"She said that she doesn't know", she continued,
"she had a long day and she has to pack for going camping tomorrow.
She really wants to go and maybe she will catch up with us.
She said to put her as a maybe."

I guess she's camping tomorrow and returning early Sunday.
Will we really meet Sunday?
Her text said if I were free on doing something on Sunday,
so it is not that we will reschedule on Sunday.

Will I even get a message?

The project is coming up nicely.
We looked at some possible networks to implement.
The tutorial also wasn't so awkward.

Yesterday—was it before or after the words?—I got a message from Neda
asking me about a bug in Qrater.
I didn't go to the social meeting, either.

Should I change shirts even though Molly's not going to go?

I feel my fingers weird.

Does she really want to go so badly? Is it because of me?
Of course not.

I was coding yesterday after having the second beer.
I got back to the PC after I wanted to show Monica the app,
but my phone could not log in.
I figured out it was a csrf token error,
but couldn't get the info of how to solve it.
I felt like in those dreams where I can't use the phone.

20 minutes before we leave. I need to finish this and change.

After showering, I didn't put any cream on my hair.
I braided it instead.
I had already showered when Alda told me about going out.

Monica told me that braids look really good on me.
I started telling her about how I feel dysphoric and insecure.
I like covering my face.
When I thought about going out with Molly
I actually thought about wearing my hair down.

I've grabbed my phone four times to see the exact words that Monica wrote,
but I keep forgetting what I wanted to do.
Instead, I'm talking to Armando.
It's not possible that Molly's going to go.
It will not happen.

I send to him a GIF of a dog running with an invisible body
and its ears flopping.

"wat", he replied.

"It's u... comin"

I am still laughing at my own joke, like an idiot.
Armando will be here any minute now.
His first message said he was 10 minutes away.
I need to finish these words.
If I don't do them at this moment,
I will certainly not write them before midnight.

What would it mean if Molly did end up arriving?

"Qué clase de _maybe porque me voy a acampar_ es eso...
Si vas a acampar es _nel_, 100%"

I'm still 100 words away from the goal and I think I hear the door creaking.

I still need to change my shirt, even though she is not going to be there.

"Si aparece la Molly me cago pa' todos lados."

Will I eat there?
I think I finished eating at 8pm.
Have I been writing the words for almost an hour?
That can't be true.
I should get up now and finish my shirt.
Molly might end up catching with us there, after all.

### Saturday, August 7th, 2021
I'll start my words early today.
I just ordered the electronics toolkit from Amazon
and the GBA stuff from that modding store.
It's 13h right now.
I feel a little hungover
and with some faint leftover effects from last night's weed.

"Yeah, Molly's just said she's not coming", ended up saying Alda.

"I mean, yeah, I assumed she wasn't going to."

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still a little disappointed.
Later, in the evening, after we had been seated on the terrace,
we went back to that conversation about Alda's naive and young-looking date.
She added how Molly's also too immature.
She's apparently in that phase of dating so much.

No, that's not right.
I mean, it did happen, but it wasn't the first time that the topic came up.
It was after Armando asked her if, when she invited her,
she told her that I was coming.

"I mean, I didn't say _Sofia_, but I said _coming with my roommates_..."

No, not that.

"Yeah, I don't think we're even meeting Sunday."

"Oh, she offered to go out when she's coming back?", replied Armando,
"you didn't say that, you said she cancelled."

I confessed that I had lied, and said again how I was doubtful.

"I mean, she does date a lot", Alda then added,
"at the party she was just mentioning how she went on four dates that week."

"Oh, you have a lot of competition!", exclaimed Armando.

As I would later sent to Monica when I came home and went to bed,
I do feel intimidated.

"I mean, I didn't even ask her for a real date. I'm way behind..."

I feel so stupid right now.
Like doing something completely foreign to me,
and I am coming at it with the worst perspective.

The brewery was 40 minutes away from our place.
It was a long but pretty amenable walk.
I enjoyed it, and was a little excited.
Halfway there, Armando said how he didn't want to crush our spirits,
but it might end up being pretty crowded.
We thought that it would be a good idea to have a backup plan
in case that we wouldn't be able to be seated in.

Fortunately, that didn't end up happening.
The terrace was, indeed, full when we arrived.
The hostess offered us to seat us inside or to wait for a table to vacate.
Armando said that he's still not ready to be inside.
I don't think I cared either way, but I did prefer being outside.
She would save our table inside if we ended up changing our mind.

It was around 15-20 minutes until we took a table in the corner.
There was this huge dog on the table besides us.
I miss Nymeria.
Does she miss me, too?
Does she think of me?
My mum mentioned how she no longer sleeps in my bed.
She stopped after my aunt and uncle slept in there.
She thinks it might be because the sheets no longer smell like me.

"So, do you think she will end up messaging me Sunday?",
I asked Armando on our way home.

I don't remember what he replied back.

Alda and I shared a pitcher of a Stout beer and a plate of Nachos.
Armando chose a framboise beer.
Alda and I then ordered each a glass of _Péché mortel_.
Finally, before they were to close the kitchen/bar,
Alda had a glass of Pilsner and Armando a pretzel.

I had half of Alda's _Péché Mortel_.
I was pretty drunk.
Like the night of the BBQ, I was starting to have double vision.
I mentioned to them the time that I peed my pants.
I didn't really tell the story, just made a reference to it.
Alda asked us if we had ever peed in public.
Just as she finished wording the question,
she answered herself that Armando sure had.
She was more interested in my answer.
Does that mean I pass?

When Francisco started wondering if I were trans,
he first wondered if I was transitioning in the other direction.
Karen told him not to ask me.

"That is not something you bring up."

Monica said recently that she didn't know what I was talking about
when I brought up _masculine features_.
Even when she was with me, she added, she always thought I had fine features.
I think this is the first time after we've started talking to each other again
that she's brought up our time together.

It was a contrast to that other time
I was telling her about the incident with Said's friend and Diego.
I was worried that they knew I was trans.
Then, she was equally surprised about my wonderings.
_Of course they would know_, she thought, _it was obvious_.

I guess it is not anymore?
I won't even pretend to wonder if that would be better.
Of course it'd be harder.
Then again, I guess I still am living in some sort of closet.

### Sunday, August 8th, 2021
In my first year of transition—I don't even remember
if I was on hormones already—I felt the urge to being seen.
Every oportunity to go out
and the potential of being referred to as a woman was exhilirating.
An hour ago I was just writing in the notebook
about the time when I had scheduled a date with Catherine.
We would go do something after her return from her shift.
She had said she'd be leaving around 5pm.
An hour before that I was already changed and had applied make up.
I kept the phone with me and remained attentive for every notification.
Time kept passing and my messages stayed unreceived.

At the end, possibly two hours after that, Catherine finally replied.
She had been asked to do a full 8h shift.
Her phone had died and she was exhausted.
We would have to postpone.
She was sorry and so was I.
I cried, probably.
I don't remember if I took off my clothes at that moment or
if I just stayed like that for the rest of the afternoon.

I woke up at 5h and grabbed my phone as if there were something to be seen
that early in the morning.
I could not go back to sleep.
I did my own trick of burying my face under the pillow,
but there was no difference.

The packages are on their way.
I bought the wooden cutting board, the gameboy parts, and the electronic toolkit.
The keyboard has supposedly arrived in Canada already.
I don't know how long before it goes through customs.
I guess I will need to pay tarifs.
I have no idea of how much.

This is the second half of the weekend that I so hardly waited for.
I have showered and put on some shorts and an old t-shirt.
My nails are painted black just to have something different.
There is some music coming from the window.
I can hear it even through my noise-cancelling headphones.
I am almost done with the first part of _La Casa de Papel_.
I don't think the music is from our neighbors.
Maybe it is.

My fast is done.
I could eat right now, but I don't really feel that hungry.
I am losing some weight again.
I had been seeing me rounder in the mirror.
It is nice feeling content with my own appaerance.

Should I go out today, even if no message comes?

I glanced at the phone again.

I could maybe go to the park.
Sit in the grass and just relax under the sun.
Perhaps bring a book with me and read for a while.
Some distraction and fresh air would be nice.
Is this that same need of being seen?

Will Armando notice my leave?
Will he ask something or make a question?
Do I want to feel noticed?

I don't really want to stay in front of a screen the whole weekend.
There is still more than half of Neuromatch left.
Yesterday, in the morning, there was a message from Farrokh, our project TA.
Are they really expecting us to work during the weekend?

This is the busiest week that I've had in a long time.
Hassan mentioned he is in Germany at the moment.
Apparently, he purposefully chose this timing.
His PI wouldn't let him enroll unless he continues with his experiments.

Have I been this lucky with my PIs in my research career?
Would I be able to make it were mine like that?

In my mind, when I thought about Molly,
I told myself that the feasible window for her message,
if there is one, would be between 12h and 16h.

_Hey! Not gonna lie, for a moment I actually thought you had forgotten about me._

I'm sure Monica wouldn't agree with sending that.

I had to leave for a moment.
I got a call.
For a minute, I actually thought that it could be her.
_It was probably the courier_, I thought.
He was.
I took my mask and wallet and went upstairs to open the door for him.
I got the battery and the toolkit.
The cutting board might arrive later.

I sent a couple of memes to the roommate conversation,
and the latest batch to Monica.
Should I go to _Parc Jean-Mance_ or look for a new different place?
I also have the dog park right in front of the building.
My original plan was getting a shower and going for a trip to the groseries.
Groceries.
Monica had corrected me for that word before.

I sure hope these words will help me with my english.
I need to talk with more people.
Meet more people.

Why do I sometimes feel so alone?

### Monday, August 9th, 2021
"So, did she end up sending you a message after all?",
asked me Armando this morning when I went to grab a glass of water
as he was putting his mug in the dish-washer.

"Who?", I asked even though I was perfectly sure whom he was referring to.

"Molly."

"No."

I kept the phone to my side most of the day.
When the plausible time window I had given myself passed,
I knew nothing would end up happening that day.
Still I glanced at the phone waiting for something.

I talked with Monica.
I exchanged some messages with Armando.
I said nothing to Alda.
Why did I find it harder to tell her?

_She's too young, anyway_, I kept saying to myself to ease it a little.
It did not really help.

I'm pretty sure I'll get a message,
maybe today or later this week, apologizing.
She might have forgotten after all.
Who knows.
Maybe she didn't want to go in the first place.
In the back of my mind,
I'm a bit worried Alda had told her
how my intentions were to ask her out in the first place
and that changed her mind.

I opened the apps to feel a little less alone.
No, that's not true.
I got a notification and grabbed the phone with excitement
only to find a yellow notification.
It was from Bumble.
A new match.
Did it come with a new message?
No, I sent the first message.

Her names is Flore.
The conversation did not die this time.
I don't know if it was because I had Monica as an spectator,
or if it was the sudden burst of loneliness and rejection I had experienced
a couple of hours before.

When we chatted it felt more sincere than other times, more human.
At the end, I was thinking of suggesting meeting up for the coffee dates
she mentions in her bio, but she said it first.
I gave her my number.
By the time I turned my head to sleep,
I had already a message from her in Telegram.

I might ask her to meet today or tomorrow.
I'll text her in my breaks and see what happens.
I sent a last message to Monica asking her opinion.
Whether she thought I would end up getting a message from Molly today,
or if the Sunday was sign to not expect anything anymore from her.

I got Monica's response.

"_Too soon to tell_.
Pero, hey, a lo mejor te gusta la francesa.
_Give her a chance_."

I got distracted and thought I had already finished with these words.

In 15 minutes, a bit less than that, I'll have to sign in to Zoom.
We got a message from Farrokh an hour ago.
He said that we'll have a meeting today
to see what we have done and what we should do.
I feel a little bit irritiated by that.
We just had a meeting Friday.
It was the weekend, what does he expect we have done?

I guess I'll give the words a rest.
I have to be in Zoom in five minutes.
I don't think I'll manage to type 200 words in that time.

I sent Monica a screencap of Flore's message, inviting me to ask her out.
She likes her better, she says.
Probably she's just being nice.

"Don't you overanalyze it, bitch! I mean it. Give french fry a chance",
Monica finished.

She's right. She's so right that I want to laugh and cry a little.

It *is* also too soon to tell.

I didn't send her the screencapture I took of the profile picture
I found of Molly in Telegram.

_I wish she sends me a message_, I thought last night,
_if only to just mention this amazing profile picture_.

Three more minutes.
100 words to go.
I might make it after all.
No, I'll come back.
There is nobody in the Zoom session.
Am I too early?
Maybe I am too late.
Someone else is here.
Ilenna.
She's talking to me right now.
We're talking about our weekends.
Her projects, her to-dos. Everyone's coming in.

The Alpha group is being reduced to only two people,
which means it has to be disbanded.
That means our team will integrate them.
Is Ming one of those leaving?
Ilenna is talking about it right now.
I don't really care either way.

### Tuesday, August 10th, 2021
_So, I take yesterday was a no-go._

Monica told me not to send that.
Armando said not to, as well.
I did it, anyway.

_Don't overthink it, bitch!_, had said Monica.

And that I did, too.

I had the message in my drafts, all ready to be sent.
I was a little drunk, but not quite there yet.
I only ate a bowl of rice and had just finished a beer.
It was only a nice buzz,
not the excuse I would use years ago when I did not want to take responsability
of my own thoughts or actions.

This wasn't that.
I thought about it.
I knew that it wouldn't help with anything and,
probably, just make things worse.
But I did it.
I sent it.

"Do you want to go tomorrow for those decafs?
Or would you rather wait for the weekend/your holiday?"

Did I sent that before or after?

This time I did not have to wait too much for an answer from either of them.

During one of my breaks I wanted to publish something in instagram.
At that point, was I still looking at her *last time seen online*?
The last time I did that it was with Catherine,
I think it was just after that incident of Las Vegas.
No, before that I guess.

"Do you know those people who like getting scared?
As in they love horror movies, or thrills and action sports?
I'm like that, but with misery."

When we talked about it,
I explained how I find comfort in situations when I'm able to put a name
to the shitty feeling that I'm experiencing.
Situations when I'm able to tell exactly what's causing my feelings and why.
There wasn't even 24h since we had started talking
and I was already talking about my depression.

Why do I feel this again?
It's not really sadness.
I mean, sure, I'm a little sad and disappointed about the weekend,
but, it's not that.
I feel something small and dark inside,
like a faint urge to bury my neck in somebody's neck and start sobbing.

I need to go pick up my pills this afternoon.
The pharmacist said to come after 16h.
I can go after finishing today's tutorials,
maybe I'll take the long route and make a stop at the supermarket.

Flore said she couldn't today.
It was not a camping trip, but a yoga class.
We are meeting tomorrow after work.
She would look up some good place that would make justice to the occasion,
my first time drinking coffee at a café in Montreal.
I had a latte once, but I drank it on the street.
I guess that doesn't count.

I deleted my sent message, as if that were to make a difference.
She had seen my instagram stories earlier.
Her silence was intentional, I assume.
That's bullshit.
I'm such a needy bitch.
It's fucking Monday.

"Sorry...", her reply started.

She was camping all weekend and there was no cell signal.
She came back around 1H.
I sent another message back and felt shittier than before.
Last week, I had this strange anxious need to be the one to sent the last message.
It helped nothing.

And that was it.
I stayed in the balcony for half an hour after finishing my beer.

I could not sleep too well.
I saw some TV show in my ipad until I was more tired.
I fell asleep maybe an hour past midnight.
I woke up this morning as soon as the sun started to rise, around 6h.
I got up an hour after and showered.
It's still two hours until the start of the day.

I wish I were home.
I miss my dog.
No, it's not home where I want to be, just away from here.

I have a date this week.
The conversation with Flore was nice, it felt warm and human.
She seems interested, too.

"I have a few ideas, but as it will be your first café here,
I feel a lot of pressure!", she explained.

"No pressure! I have simple tastes."

"No pressure, but responsabilities for sure."

"I'm sure it'll be great", I said trying to calm her.

"Oh yeah, I feel quite good about it"

That's one of us, I guess.

I could eat something right now.
16h have passed since yesterdays meal.
I don't feel quite hungry.
I'm slimmer now than a couple of weeks ago.
I will wait until the afternoon.
My coffee is almost done.

I want what I can't have.

### Wednesday, August 11th, 2021
I'm halfway through Neuromatch Academy.
Flore said that we could commemorate it by going to a café.
I just came from _Parc Laval_,
where we sat chatting on a bench in front of a fountain.
She had her red bike next to her.
We had picked it up from in front of _café Santropol_,
where she had left it before I arrived a little late.

We were talking about the pandemic and our mental health,
of why I moved from psychology to neuroscience,
how because she's on antidepressants she can't really cry at movies anymore.
She decided to walk with me to _Av des Pins_, where we could split.
I'd go south and she'd go north to take the bike path of _St-Denis_.

I told Monica when I got home how I still find it weird here
that it's not a custom to say hi or goodbye with a kiss on the cheek.
I never know what to do.
When the time came to say our goodbyes,
my insecurity turned my _I'll be seeing you around_ to a question.
She looked back at me and replied with a shy and sincere smile.

"Uh, I dunno; I hope so?"

I don't have data anymore until a couple of days from now when my plan ends.
I warned Flore when I was leaving home that I'd be uncommunicated and,
because I was running a couple of minutes late, I'd be arriving any time soon.
When we split, I walked back home with a stupid smile in my face.
I wanted so badly to just arrive home and text Monica about the night.

"Maybe it is because of my insecurities", I told her,
"but because the conversations flowed so easily and nicely,
how she seemed so interested and easygoing with me,
deep down I assumed there must be something wrong with her."

I was actually surprised how much I liked her.
Although there were times when I found it hard to understand her,
her accent was so sweet.
I liked how she_d say _voilá as a way to confirm her point.
Even as I am writing this, I can't help but smile.

Today the day was hot and humid.
I have the AC turned on right now.
It was on several times during the day when I was on Zoom.
I needed to shut it off when it was my turn to share my screen and read.
Even then, I turned it on during my break because the heat was unbearable.

It was hard for me to get up this morning.
I woke up after 8h.
When I wanted to shower, Armando had just gotten to it first.
I still had time to shower and brew my coffee before the start of our project.
We figured out how to load our data.
I signed for the free trial of one month of Google One
after the pre-processing and loading of the data filled my 15G of free storage.

I received the package from retromodding.
I got to change the gameboy SP's case.
I'm pretty sure everyone saw how I was busy doing something else
while we were working on the second half of the project,
and especially during the tutorials.
I find them more and more hard to follow.

Tomorrow, I'll have a meeting with Louis. I...

I start to feel it again.
The worry that I did something wrong, that I wasn't charming enough;
that Flore will lose interest, or maybe even has lost it already.

I also hope that I will see her again.
She had had a boyfriend, no, a fiancé.
She's bisexual.
Why did I find it a little bit disappointing?
Shouldn't it make things easier?
Do I need to tell her that I am trans before I see her again?
Will I see her again?

The keyboard finally got out of customs.
It should be arriving soon, hopefully.
I posted pictures of how my gameboy ended up in Instagram,
in part to see if Molly would see them.
She did not.

I feel really tired.
I maybe should take Louis' offer of a time off.
But, then again, it might be better off to wait a little longer
until Monica comes here.
She will come, will she?
It is a sure thing, is it?

### Thursday, August 12th, 2021
"I made it home without getting lost!
BTW, I had a really great time."

I sent her a message as soon as I got home.
When I was planning to tell Monica,
I thought about saying something about having grown accostumed to let the
other person know that I've gotten home safely after living in Mexico.
Honestly, I just wanted to let her know.

I got no answer.
I continued with my night and went to bed.
I did not check the phone when I woke up like I used to do last week with Molly.
For some reason I didn't feel the need to.

There was something that made me feel weird.
It was 6h. I went to the restroom.
I was not wearing my glasses, so when I flushed it looked clean enough.
I actually remember checking and explicitly thinking that it looked fine.
I guess it wasn't.
Not much later I got a message from Armando asking me to, in the future,
check that it's fully clean as it, well, wasn't.

I felt so embarrased.
Of course I apologized and said it would not happen again.
I still felt unclean.
He tried to continue the conversation lightening the issue.
I could not get back to sleep anyway.

I showered and got ready for the start of the day at 10h.
We had a meeting with Farrokh, again.
I find our meetings so pointless and a waste of time.
I felt tired all day.
For a moment I was worried that I might be starting to get sick.
It was hot outside, so it might not necessarily be a fever.
I had a mild headache and was feeling irritable.

I didn't do much for the coding and designing of our model.
The keyboard arrived today.
There was no charge for tariffs nor taxes.
Instead I just got a notification saying it had arrived.
I expected the usual paper telling me to go to the postal office to pick it up,
but it was just there.
In the first break I didn't do much.
I think I just lied on the bed for a couple of minutes.
I did not eat until the second one.

Still there was no message from Flore.
I started to get a little bit worried.
Maybe she wasn't so interested after all.
Maybe she noticed my transness and decided to just ghost me.
Maybe it would be like Molly all over again.
I could wait until after the weekend and ask her about her PI's partner.
That ended up being the plan.

No, her message came right before the second break.
She apologized about not replying before,
she went straight to bed last night and all of her day had been a rush.
She wished me a great day.

I started dismantling my laptop to change the keyboard.
I ate one of my frozen burritos at the same time.
When we came back to finish the tutorials,
I decided to grab the laptop and
continue unscrewing the 66 screws of the keyboard.
I didn't pay any attention to the extra bonus material.

We finished early.
I changed the keyboards and tested it.
Everything seems to be working, the webcam, the microphone, the keyboard.
Everything but the buttons of the trackpad.
It's weird because only the left one is the one that never responds.
The other two sometimes are unresponsive,
but when I toggle the trackpad in xinput they start working again.
It might be an issue with Linux.

I tried restoring Windows, but the laptop doesn't boot from the USB.

The conversation continued with Flore.
I showed her the pictures and I told her the story behind it.
She was impressed, so I sent her also the pictures of the GameBoy.
I told myself that now I don't really care if the conversation with Molly continues,
but I'd be lying if I said I didn't check again this morning
if she had seen the Instagram stories.
She did.

She suggested me to post videos on the internet.
She joked how she would inspire me to being TikToker.
I said I was too old for being on TikTok,
so then we chatted a bit about the generation Z and Millenials.

The conversation flowed really well.
I felt so much at ease that, for a moment, I even forgot how pretty she is.

"Mona, from now on call me Porfirio because I think I have a crush with
_La France_"

### Friday, August 13th, 2021
The second week of Neuromatch is done.
One more to go and it's done.
A couple days ago—or was it last week?—the other girl in my pod
sent me a private message in Zoom during one of the tutorials sessions.
She told me that she was glad that we were together that time.
I replied privately, that I did, too.
Just the first day I wrote how I really felt different and uncomfortable
in a group of only men.

Today, when Ilenna again put me in a group with Rich, I was disappointed.
He made a comment about how my typing was really loud.
I apologized and muted myself, I might had not participated since then.
He wasn't necessarily being an asshole with his comment yet it felt harsh.
I don't know.

When we were in the last 15 minutes of discourse,
Era sent me another message privately saying she was lost 80% of the time.
Maybe I'm the opposite of Rich.
He looks bored and annoyed all the time.
He answers succintly and cold,
as if sharing the correct answer is the only way to make the dread of sharing
time with us shorter.
Maybe Era sees in me another person who doesn't understand,
who pretends she does but is actually lost.
Or maybe is just easier to empathize with me as I am the only other woman
besides Ilenna, the TA.

I won't lie, the idea did cross my mind that she might be attracted to me.
Maybe she's gay?
Maybe she's a chaser.
Or maybe she just wants to befriend the tranny.

Flore hasn't replied to the last message I sent last night.
Even though I was just chatting with Monica about her, Molly and Sonny,
this doesn't feel like yesterday.
I know she was going to that chalet with her lab.
Even if it's tomorrow, maybe she just had another busy day, so did I.

I'm sure that I want to ask her out again after she returns from her trip.
Maybe the pizza place she mentioned that other day.
Or one of those other places that I sent to the roommates' group.
I might propose to get some food and go lie down on a park somewhere.

What if it happens the same thing that happened with Molly?
What if I come too strong?

"Y cuando le das sus putazos a _la croissant_?"

Armando was referring to that phrase he told us,
about hitting someone on her lips with his.

"Idk, el finde se va de camping..."

Even through text he laughed so hard.
He's also leaving for the weekend,
he's going to Ottawa to visit his girlfriend and her family.
She's going to come soon in a few days.

We joked about it in our group.
I then realized that Alda didn't know we were actually referring to a different girl.
She might think I'm way too much into what happened with Molly.
And probably I was; maybe I am.

Monica sent me a screenshot of a post in Facebook and asked me for an explanation.
Hadn't I just said that me and Sonny were not talking anymore?
This afternoon she sent me a message saying _Hi_.
I replied back when I was heating my food, hours after it was delivered.
We haven't really been talking, but I do see what Monica means.

I feel hesitant to have this conversation with Sonny,
about how I am starting to see other people.
I should not tell her until it is something serious.
It is not.
It was just a date.

What if Flore says no to my asking for a second date?
This time we didn't talk about hanging out.
It was specifically set as a 'coffee date'.
She literally said she hoped we would see each other again.

Maybe she's just being nice.
Molly was being nice.
Everyone is nice until they aren't anymore.
I was nice until I will tell Sonny that I don't love her anymore and
that I don't really want to keep talking to her.

### Saturday, August 14th, 2021
_Why didn't you come yesterday? It was Molly's birthday!_
- Vix

Armando left today for Ottawa.
He's going to visit his girlfriend.
She's on her grandma's house—was it her grandma or another relative?— so
he's visiting her for the weekend and until midweek.
Flore didn't reply to my message yesterday,
and, even though I know for sure that today she's in her PI's chalet,
I am feeling a little uneasy.
What if it's exactly like what happened with Molly?
After today, I don't know anymore.
I feel more and more anxious after telling people about our date.
Did Molly told people about me asking her out?
I guess now that she probably did.

I was setting up my laptop in the living room when Alda asked me if I wanted to
join her with her joint.
I said yes to joinning her, but I would not smoke.
Earlier—or was it yesterday?—Armando told us of he's trip,
and I made a joke asking him to please not tell me he was going camping.
We joked a bit in the group.
I texted him separately that I was a bit worried that Alda sure had thought
I was still hurt about Molly.

Maybe that's why she didn't invite me.
Sitting there I told her about Flore, and how she was camping.
She said how Vix had invited her to go to this market in _Saint Laurent_ and
that I could go with them.
I agreed.
It would be good to get out of the house and do something.
She said that even if he cancelled, we could go somewhere just the two of us.

I continued working on my laptop before we left around 14h.
On the way, she asked me to stop at a dépanneur for a bottle of gatorade.
She told me she had gone out last night.
It was the birthday of a friend of hers so they went to get drinks.
Apparently, the girl from Lizz's party, the one that had that fight with her
friend, was still talking about it.
That was as much as Alda told me about the day before.

We met Vix and Sam.
Was Sam her name?
I am getting worse and worse with names.
I don't remember a single name from the group of frat guys.
They continued talking about last night.
They asked us if we had seen a smoothie place.
I guess they were also pretty hungover.
We walked around.
I replied to Sonny's messages.

Yesterday Monica sent me a screencapture of Sonny's tag in Facebook.

"A ver, a ver. Explícame esto. No que ya no hablaban?".

She asked me if I had told Sonny about Flore.
"Of course not, it is nothing serious yet", I said,
even though I am experiencing all these sort of feelings to which I can't
remember the last time I've felt.

She said that someone could get hurt.
Even though she was worried about me not getting over Sonny,
I think she wasn't totally wrong.
I don't feel the same thing for Sonny, but it is possible that someone will
get hurt if I continue being this careless.

I decided to talk with Sonny today.
Before getting into the shower, I told Sonny how Monica had scolded me.

"Madre del creador."

I sent her a couple of messages saying that I felt worried.
I told her that the last thing I'd want to do is hurt her.

"¿Por qué lo harías?", she asked.

"Because you still have feelings for me."

"And I know clearly you don't", she threw back at me.

"No como antes"

"Yo sé", was the last message she sent.

The last quote of me saying that I don't want to hurt her was left unreceived.

After the walk, the group decided to meet some guys they had met last night.
They were at this place in old Montreal that was supposed to be quite nice.
We took the metro to get there.
I felt uncomfortable from the moment we saw them.
They were this group of american men in their mid thirties,
celebrating a bachelor's party for a future groom.
The restaurant was quite accomodating in seating us together.
Alda had mentioned she was debating going to her date or not.
Then she had the idea of asking him to join us.
When we were there she finally decided she would go.
I felt thankful to have an excuse to leave.

In the middle of the awkward conversations, Vix turned to me and asked me
why I didn't go to Molly's party.
Did I remember right then and there how I had suspected it was hers?
Was I that surprised?
At the moment I didn't even wonder how he knew I've met Molly, since he was not
at the party where we met.
Molly had said she worked with him.
Probably she told him.
Was that the reason he asked me about recent dates?

I felt awkward talking to yet another person about Flore.
What then, when she cancels me later, or she just stops replying to my messages?
Like now, I guess.
No.
Her Bumble profile clearly states she's kilometers away.
It also states that she's looking for a relationship, so she's probably not
avoiding _putting all her eggs in one basket_.

"I didn't say anything because I felt bad about not inviting you",
Alda would later tell me.

Alda told me how she kinda understood.
She heard her—or maybe she told her personally?—that she felt weird about
going out with a friend of a friend.
Did they talk about me?
Someone at least told Vix.

Molly had a great date with this other girl named Molly.
They asked her if that meant that she would stop seeing the other girls,
but she answered no.

My eyes were crying all day for no reason, but mostly on the way home.

"Don't worry, you'll find other Mollys", Alda joked.

"I swear I have gotten over her!", I joked back.

It is not about Molly's—now clear—rejection nor the anxiety about Flore's
potential one nor the rejection I sent Sonny.

Why do I feel like crying now, for real?

_"Cómo estás, Sofi? Porque... te puedo decir Sofi o te puedo decir_ mi amor_?"_
- Paty

I think I've been forgetting to take my hormones.
This early morning, half-awake, I had an orgasm in my sleep.
I don't remember exactly what the dream was about,
or even if it was really a dream.
There were no images, just sensations.

I kept thinking about Molly's numerous dates
and whether Flore could be doing something similar.
Was I one of her baskets?
In Flore's Bumble profile she states that she's looking for a relationship.
My insecurities make me forget that she liked my profile for a reason.
If she weren't attracted to me, she could had just swiped the other direction
like the tons of other people in there.
Or she could had just ignored my message.
Or declined the date.
Or finished it as soon as we exited the café.

She hasn't returned from the chalet.
It wasn't the intention for why I looked into her profile,
but I saw how right at the bottom it stated she was 73km away.

I asked Monica if I could invite her to the second date myself,
or should I wait for her to take the initiative now?

I retook yesterday's conversation with Sonny.
I didn't mention any of the girls or that I am—or at least trying to—seeing
other people.
She probably suspects it.

Alda came back from her date with _baby-face_.
She was smiling when she told me that she now knows that she doesn't
_feel it_ with him.
They even kissed, she added.
But he was "too soft".
They did talk about a third date, though.

I fixed the trackpad issue with tango.
Or at least I thought I did.
When Alda asked me if she could see the OS, I turned it on and did the fix,
but it was still unresponsive.
I added a wallpaper and set up the ssh keys to github and the clusters.

Paty posted a story with a bag of popcorn, two potatoes and a roll of toilet
paper over a cutting board and the caption:
_es de adultos ir a robar comida a la casa de tus padres, ¿no?_.

"Paty, no te comas el papel de baño", I sent her.

We continued joking around, and flirting.
I sent a screencapture of the conversation to Monica.
She didn't know at first who she was.
When I sent her the message, even I worried that I had gotten her name wrong.
Maybe flirting is just fun.
Maybe people actually like it instead of thinking you're a creep.
It all started at that evening at the mezcal place. It was someone's birthday.
Why did I started with the flirting?
What were we playing?

"Ay Sofi, nomás porque tengo novia, sino super sí."

I should get to the NMA coding.
I said that I would work on it and test it on the weekend.
I feel the heavy burden of not really knowing how to do it or even where to
start that keeps me from getting my hands on it.
I feel tired.
I just want to lie down on the bed and take a long nap.

My mom sent me yesterday a couple of pictures of Nymi playing with my uncle
in the sofa of the living room.
I miss that house.
No, it's not the house, I miss my dog.

Miguel doesn't see the messages I send him on Telegram.
Is it that he doesn't see them or that he ignores the notifications?
It's the same single checkmark under those messages that is under the ones
that I sent Flore.

When I told Alda I was a little worried after everything that happened yesterday,
she tried to calm me down saying that sometimes shit happens;
if she's camping, it is understandable that she's not on her phone.

I don't really expect her to reply back during her trip, do I?
Why am I this clingy and needy?
I never have been on something casual with anyone.
Does Helena count?
I guess we kissed and our day visiting Salamanca's main cathedral could also
count as a date.
We walked all along braga, and she even asked someone to take our picture.
She wasn't that interested later.
I was an awkward shell of a person by then, to be fair.

I guess that, as rejections go, Molly's went as soft and kind as they can be.

### Monday, August 16th, 2021
I promised to myself and Monica that I would wait until she replied.
I couldn't.
What was I thinking?
In my head I would send the message and, in a couple of minutes,
all of them would get the double checkmarks.
I'd receive an apology saying that she hasn't gotten a notification,
like it used to happen with Sonny, and then a conversation would be sparked.
I'd feel a small glimpse of happiness.

But nope.
Instead I sent the message and now I feel like shit because I couldn't wait
half a day.
I'll be looking overly-desperate and clingy and she will lose the little
interest that she used to have—if there was really any left—.
What now?
Either she replies in a couple of hours and I'll feel like this huge idiot
for obsessing over such a stupid thing,
or she won't and I'll feel anxious for the rest of the week.

Sometimes I really hate myself.

Tomorrow is the appointment with the doctor.
I had thought that I could go on without mentioning my medical worries
of the last few months, or my mental health issues that have been coming back.
I felt OK for a couple of days, but I think I'm hitting a rough spot again.
I feel like crying.
There is this pressure deep down my chest that hugs my throat.
I feel the edges of my eyes getting moist.
I am so, so tired.

I woke up at around 4h.
This time I didn't have a sexual dream.
Did I forget my pill again?
It's not even an hour since I sent the message and I keep checking the phone.
This will for sure be another Molly situation.

Maybe I failed to be charming.
Maybe she feels like Alda, but without her pressure to keep going.
Probably I'm just overthinking shit again.

I feel so alone sometimes.

Hao-Ting posted a question in Twitter asking if anyone knew where she could
buy V60 filters.
I replied to her that I had bought them from this café near that metro station.
She sent me a personal message stating the she has arrived.
But not to worry, she's meeting a friend downtown.
She has friends here already.
What friends do I have?
Alda's?

_Why didn't you come yesterday? It was Molly's birthday!_

I feel tired.
The break is almost over.
10 minutes left and I will have to get back.
Then there won't be a break until the very end.

Why did I feel the urge to come out to Alda?

Yesterday I messed up my laptop's settings and it was almost unusable.
I decided to try to fix it in the early morning as I was already awake
and I wouldn't probably be able to go back to sleep.
I showered at around 5h, brewed some coffee and went at it.
It took me more than an hour to figure out how to connect to the fucking internet.

It's all done, now, though.
My laptop seems to be working and is able to connect by ssh to this PC.

5 minutes before I have to go back.
I don't think I will make it.
I still have more than 200 words to go.

What did I do?
Was it that she had to carry the conversation?
Maybe she noticed my transness, the stubble, perhaps.
Or a misstep in my voice.
No, she wouldn't had said _I hope_.
It could had been just niceness.

Everyone is just nice.
Paty was just nice.
No, she was probably horny.
Maybe I'm a fetish.
Some novelty that she can scratch off her list.
Francisco told us once how he had been with this trans girl.
We can be quite the story, I guess.

I'm sure in the future, Sonny will happily tell how I would stop her from
touching me and break down crying and covering myself under the sheets.
Catherine would tell about those times we covered the mirrors with towels,
except at that moment she was a freak just like me.

_Hello_, I hear from my headphones.
Ilenna is back.
I should be back.
I'll finish the 100 words left at the next break.
Nobody is here.
I have my camera and microphone off.
I still have the music sounding.
I will wait until more people turn up.
Just need to avoid being the last one.

I want this to end.
I feel so tired.
I wish I could lie down over my bed again.
Alex came back, but there is no image.
My words are done.
I'll finish with this and then go to bed and cry.

### Tuesday, August 17th, 2021
_Here is my phone number,
in case you want to move the conversation somewhere else —
like another app or a literal place in the real material world._

I woke up early again.
This time not at 4h like yesterday, but still, before 6h.
I wasn't as tired this afternoon.
I'm just now getting to doing these words.
I have less than 30 minutes to type them out.
I had resigned myself to skip today and lose the half of a month streak
that I've accumulated.
I was ready to stay the night at Alice's.
I passed the razor over my face, grabbed my pills for tomorrow morning
and left the can of beer half empty on the coffee table.

"Wanna come over and have some tea?", Alice asked me,
"I know it's fast but you seem fun and I wanna get to know you",
she finished with a red heart at the end.

I was wearing shorts in the balcony,
feeling small droplets of rain on my thighs when I read her message.

This morning, after I saw yet again that Flore was still not online in Telegram,
I wondered if maybe she had gotten a problem with her phone.
What would happen then?
Would she look for me?
No, I am lying to myself.
I didn't do it because of that.
I wanted to make sure that she wasn't online anywhere else.
Not even that, I wanted to see her presence online somewhere so I could
know she was, in fact, choosing to ignore me.

Yesterday I asked Miguel if he could read my messages.
The messages I sent had the same single marks.
The statement under his name marked exactly how he had been online within
the past week.

I decided to ignore Alice's message thanking me for tonight,
after I chose to come back home.
Maybe what I felt with her is what Flore felt after our date.
Maybe it's what Molly thought would happen and why decided to not follow up.

Again, I feel like crying.

20 minutes until midnight.
Sonny asked me for a zoom call to help her order her macbook.
Like all of the other times, I told her I was ready and for some reason
expected her to be there at that precise moment just to become irritated
after she wasn't.
I had just decided to risk not coming back early enough for tomorrow's
class and go hook up with a stranger.
Her lose.
She replied when I was already sitting at the table,
wondering where all of my attraction had gone.

Flore knew none of my last names.
I didn't know hers.
I had her phone number as she had mine.
But if her phone was lost,
she wouldn't be able to connect to either telegram nor bumble.
Maybe I could add her on Facebook or Instagram.
I searched for her in both, but nothing came up.
We have no friends in common.

I became the creepy guy that I always fear people see me as.
I knew her PI is a woman, and portuguese.
She is at _Universtié de Montréal_, Computer Science.
I used those three datums and found the personal website of her PI.
There was a page of her lab members and in there she was.
Master's student since 2019: Flore Caye.

I added her number as a contact and she appeared on Whatsapp.
There is no online message in there either.
No new pictures in Instagram since last year.
I learned nothing except that I hate myself.

Paty's flirting fun came really close to uncomfortable.
This is not just playing anymore.
If I were my own girlfriend and found that conversation I'd be pretty pissed.

She posted about looking for a psychiatrist so I offered asking for some
references that weren't as expensive as they usually go.

"Si abro la foto y no es una nude, estaré muy decepcionada", she replied.

"No sé qué es peor... que no fuera nude o que me dijeras _amiga_"

I had my telehealth appointment with Dr. Perera.
I didn't mention the worms, but did tell her about me trying to reach her.
I also asked for a reference for a counselor.
She brought up the possibility to move on to medication for depression.

I need to call and set up the appointment.
I'll do it Friday so it will be next week.
While I was looking for Flore, I got Alice's match.
During our chat before the start of Neuromatch,
I thought she was precisely what I needed to forget about Flore.
Exactly like how I used Flore to get over Molly's rejection.

It's almost midnight after our first date and I feel a little bit worse
than when I woke up.

### Wednesday, August 18th, 2021
_Pero, aún así, en el fondo pensaba:_ Oh, esto fue lo que sintió Flore.
_Y cuando venía caminando venía pensando en eso y me deprimí.
Incluso pasó por mi cabeza, como el:_ Ay ya. Cogemos y ya; es una noche.
_Yo creo que si hubieramos estado en un sillón o así, hubiera hecho un_ move.
_Como, hacerlo nomás para pensar que sí lo hice y evitar todo lo que
estaba sintiendo y pensando._

Even though I told myself that there was no reason for it,
I grabbed the phone in the early morning expecting to smile.
I had set the alarm for 8h.
Right around 1h in the morning, I finally went to bed.
I had done the videocall with Sonny to help her with buying her laptop.
She asked me where I had been.
I deflected asking her if she really wanted to know.
I knew that would be a very cruel way to answer her question.

I didn't want to get online today.
Even last night.
I guess that was one of the reasons I decided to go and
spent the night there anyway.

When I told Monica a couple of minutes ago...

I forgot the end of that thought.
I am high again.
I do feel a little depressed since my walk back home.

I looked for Flore.
No, that was yesterday.
Today I added on her Facebook.
I sent the friend request.
That way I gave her an option to contact me even if she lost her phone,
or I would see if the request was denied and finally get the resolution
that her silence was intentional.
I feel like I had written this before.
Maybe it did happen yesterday.

I cancelled the request and then sent it again.
She hasn't connected nor denied the request.
Paty said yesterday she did delete the app.
The days would keep incrementing like Flore's.

I went through her pictures.
There are some where I don't really feel attracted to her.
She remembers me a bit too much of Aliza.
Did that night in DC really happened?
I remember very vividly scenes of someone grabbing my breasts
and the sensations of kisses on my the neck.
But that didn't happen, did it?
It was surely a dream.

There are other pictures of her lips so vividly red, her eyes so bright,
and her round face.
It hurts.

But that doesn't make a difference if... I don't want to write about this.

I made myself a sandwich.
I ate a bowl of grapes and two cold wienner sausages.
Ilenna asked us to take the picture for Neuromatch webpage or something.
I feel like my beard was dark and black.
Everyone will see it and everyone will feel the same coldness in the chest
I had when I heard Alice's voice at her entrance door.

I saw her face when she laughed and how she would move her hands around.
I saw her flatter chest and her soft and smooth skin.
I fixated on all the ways she was more femenine than me as well as the ways
she wasn't enough.
Half of them made me jealous and the other self-conscious.

I'm being cruel again.
She doesn't deserve this, and neither should I.

I feel tired again and I don't want to do this anymore.
I sent Alda a message in Whatsapp, asking her to tell me whenever she'd go to
SDQ to buy marijuana.
I wanted to smoke.
I knew that I've started to feel heavy again.
Inside.
In my chest and in my throat.

I paused the video from my zoom during the last third of the course
and I started to cry.
Again Ilenna put me on the same group as Rich.
I hate it.
I want this to end.

I feel like crying again.
Or grabbing the last beer.
I'll save it for tomorrow.

I need to lie down and have a good cry.
I need to make the appointment to look for a counselor.
I sent a message to Paty and explained the autism issue she's been worrying
about.
I, again, kept talking about the girls to Armando.
When we talked about surrogacy and IVF, he made some mixed comments,
both insinuating that he knows about me, and that he doesn't.

Maybe he doesn't.

Does Alda? Does it really matter? I should not make any comments.

I thought about sending a message to Molly asking her if she knew any queer
places around "for myself, don't worry".
That is so stupid.
I'm glad that I never got to it.
Why do I feel the need to continue?
I sent the message to that other girl I never replied to in Tinder.

I'm sure soon enough I'll log back in and the conversation will be gone.
I froze my profiles in the apps.
Some website mentioned that when the distance stops appearing is because the
user hasn't logged back in, or they've frozen it.

Maybe Flore did that.
Maybe she did it to get away from me.
Telegram, Bumble, all gone.
That's stupid.
Maby she met someone else.
No.
She just doesn't care.
She feels just as I do now for Alice.

Everyone does, everyone will.

### Thursday, August 19th, 2021
_Salí con alguien la semana pasada. Y según yo todo super bien.
Hoy me di cuenta que me ghosteó._

_De pronto ya no le llegaban mis mensajes y me sacó de pedo.
Fue como:_ Ah, está ocupada.

_Y a los dias se me hizo raro._ Ah, quizás se le perdió el fonono.
_Entonces le mandé solicitud en Facebook.
Hoy vi que la rechazó._
Ah, creo que no era eso, _pensé._

_No es tanto el rechazo, ¿sabes?
De eso ya me acostumbré, pero, no sé, es el que yo pensara que todo iba
bien..._

_¿Tu como estás? Sorry si fue mucha informacion/intimidad muy pronto._

I'm on the balcony right now.
I've drunk two ciders and one beer.
It's not even 17h.
I'm already seeing double, but I don't really care.
I deserve just one evening of letting loose.

I checked, like I usually do, but this time the button for the
friend request didn't appear.
Facebook only gave me the option to send her a message.
I opened Victoria's profile to double check and it appeared the same way.
I'm already busy with the feelings that I'm experiencing,
so I won't even get into Vicky's issue.
I thought it was pretty obvious that Flore had just denied my friend request.
Then, everything became clear.
She had deleted Telegram.
When I gave her my phone she offered whatsapp.
When I got her telegram message,
the same profile picture welcomed me as the one in her Bumble profile.
Maybe she created the app just for me?
Then, there wouldn't be any issue to just delete the app.
I was talking to Armando, when I realized it myself.
We were in the middle of the project half of the day.
Everything is done, we were just setting the slides for tomorrow's presentation.
I knew that I wouldn't be able to follow up with the tutorial.
Also, there was a way too high of a chance to be in the same sub-pod with Rich.

_It's too much, man._

I counted the minutes until the first break.
When the breakout rooms were finally closed,
I stayed until everyone closed their video and I spoke up.

"Hey, Ilenna, uh, I'm not feeling very well right now,
is it OK if I skip this tutorial?
I need to make an appointment with a counselor and, yeah..."

"Yeah, sure, it's not problem", she said back,
"You have all of the attendance. There's no problem."

I took her words at heart and disconnected from Zoom.
The slides should be ready for tomorrow, and, honestly,
I don't really give a shit if everything is ruined for my
_one-minute_ participation in our slides.

I called to McGill's Wellness Hub and waited to be received by the secretary
to ask for an appointment with a counselor.
The next available slot is for September 7th.

Whatever.

Monica told me not to.
_Don't look her up or send her anything._
I did it anyway.
I sent her a message stating the facts.
I sent her her the Facebook request because
I thought my messages hadn't been delivered,
maybe something happened to her phone.
Anyway, sorry for not getting the hint.
Of course the message is unreplied.
I don't expect it to go any differently.
I was right, calling her out won't make me feel any better.
But, still, I do feel a little bit better just having the last message.

I told Armando I would get a break from dating for now.
Still, I sent five different messages to five different girls, including Alice.

Yesterday was my mum's birthday.
I sent her a message today, but I still feel like I fucked up.

"Guys, I'm having a blue day and I'm really considering getting super drunk
and ordering a pizza. Do you want any?", I sent out to our roommate's group.

Alda replied to me that she had some white rum.
Later she said that she's getting a test for her cough.
She doesn't really believe that she's gotten COVID.
I don't either, but I still won't go to the lab or any other place until
she gets her results.
If she tests positive I'll schedule a test for my own.

It'd be a really good excuse.
A part of me hopes she has gotten it just to have an excuse to feel bad.

One of the girls from tinder replied to my message.
I guess that means I should not go out with her.
This morning I was just thinking how I went with Flore—or sent her a
message—because I was dealing with Molly's rejection.
It all started with that 22 year old girl.

"Heey, I was thinking... You didn't invited me to your party,
it was because I am gay, right?"

Armando laughed and told me to send it.
It was really what I felt, except it's because I am trans, not gay.
I am pretty sure that was the reason Flore ghosted me.
I talked a little about it with Monica.

She didn't make any mention to her thoughts from a couple of years ago
about it being pretty obvious.

I need to pee.
I am pretty drunk right now.
I will be even more drunk.

Hopefully I won't make a fool of myself tomorrow, or tonight.

### Friday, August 20th, 2021
_Hey, sorry, I'm in Vancouver visiting family
so I haven't been on my phone too much!_

_What do you mean you weren't invited because you're gay?
I'm a bit confused!_
- Molly

Even after having my answer, the habit is hard to break;
I went to check the Flore's profiles as if I were to find something new.
I deleted the Bumble match, made my instagram private,
and even blocked Catherine on somewhere else as if that had something
to do with anything.

Monica told me not to.
Armando would had said the same thing.
Every blog post about ghosting said I should not make any other attempt of
communication.
I sent her a message anyway.
Of course it went unreplied.

Alice's also stayed that way.
I guess she was expecting something else from that night.
What would I had done if she had answered back?
I would have been way more direct.
_Sorry about that night, I was really confused about everything.
I am just getting back into dating and ended up a little disoriented.
Do you want to hook-up?_

Maybe it's a good thing she ignored me.
It's what I should had done several times by now.

I drunk myself into stupidity and finished the job with
correctly-smoked marijuana.
I'm sure I've had this realization before, that I was smoking wrong.
I have to actually inhale the smoke into my lungs for it to take any effect.

Alda joined me in the evening and we watched some movie in netflix.
We went to the park and smoke another joint.
She asked me if there was something that had happened to put me in that state.
I lied at first, but then, little by little,
told her what had happened with Flore.

I also told the story to Paty.
We had moved the conversation to Whatsapp.
After I started, she told me she wanted to hear what I wanted to say.
I joked if it was only for my pack.
In any case she did leave me on seen after I finished,
so I guess there's also that.

Just now I'm thinking about taking the conversation again.
I would like to ask her what the hell happened years ago when we flirted.
Am I really attractive?

I don't remember if it was yesterday or this morning that I sent
all those messages to those girls in Tinder.
Today was the conversation with Nicole.
We talked about books and games.
After some back and forth I asked her about her intentions with Tinder,
and that's when the conversation died.
It's probably a good thing.

In the morning, while I was brewing my coffee,
I had this idea in my head that I had nothing to lose anyway.
Even if Molly suddenly out of nowhere sent me a text asking to meet some time,
it would be pretty stupid to agree.
So, I drafted that old joke I had told Armando about the party-drama
and me not being invited.
I just wanted **something else** to happen, maybe.

I sent it.
An hour ago I got a reply.

Neuromatch has finally ended.
This was the last day.
If Flore had not ghosted me, I could have told her that it's my last day
and it would be a great opportunity to celebrate going out,
maybe one of those mexican places I looked up or that pizza place she mentioned.
But she deleted Telegram and denied my Facebook request.
And I ordered pizza yesterday and got almost blackout-drunk in my own sadness.

I don't think it was me being trans, right?
Would she had agreed to the rest of the night?
Maybe it was the annoyance from when I couldn't decide between going back in
the direction towards _Ave du Parc_ or heading to _Le Plateau_.
Maybe she just wanted a break for her holiday and I rushed things.
Yeah, that was probably it.
Why would she delete the app in the middle of our conversation, thought?
Maybe she met somebody else.
Maybe it doesn't really matter anyway.

Once again, I was in the same tutorial pod with Rich.
This time I did send a message to Era in Discord stating how it was too bad
that Ilenna didn't put us together.
And then I mentioned Rich.
I thought she wouldn't answer back but she just did.

I also didn't expect a response from Nicole, but I got one just now.

### Saturday, August 21st, 2021
Yesterday Nicole's message stated that she's not looking for anything but
friendships given that she's just out a relationship.
Is being on Tinder looking for new friends really a thing?

The conversation died anyway, just like they usually do.
There was this other girl whose name I've already forgotten.
She asked me about my PhD and made a specific question about neuroplasticity.
She has this condition that had her bedridden,
but after some new therapy in Australia, she's now better than ever.

She might be telling the truth, she may be a really good bullshitter.
The conversation also died.

Alice never replied back, of course.
It was a sure thing that I wouldn't get a reply from Flore.
Even that stupid joke I sent to Paty asking her if she had fallen asleep again,
and that the nudes would end up being unsent again,
was unseen or at least unreplied.
After I answered—maybe I shouldn't had—to Molly's confusion,
she didn't answer back either.
I thought about sending another message, following up, clarifying more,
maybe even commenting on the weirdness of Vix's comment,
somehow shifting the blame.
Fortunately, I had the good judgement against it.
Nothing good has ever come from sending another message.
I already shitted the bed with that text after her Sunday's silence.
I fucked up with the Facebook request,
and then that 'last word' kind of thing by sending that by SMS to Flore.
That desperate and lonely message to Alice was a big "fuck you" to her face.

I am such a shitty excuse of a person.

I've been thinking about that all day long.

Hao-Ting sent me a message yesterday that she'd be looking at an apartment in
_Le Plateau_ and we could do something near that area.
I agreed to the distraction.
Maybe getting out of the house would make me good without having
to resort to alcohol again.

I wasn't right.

I had another sex dream about Monica.
I kind of hate and love those dreams.
They feel really good while they last.
But, then, as soon as I wake up, I become conscious that
not only was I with Monica, but I was also a man.
I am filled with this guilty sense of disgust and shame.
It's completely not worth it.
I don't think I'll ever share those with her.

Last night, I don't remember how exactly the conversation took that turn,
but I started telling her about Sex Reassignment Surgery in Thailand.
She told me how she loved that I could tell her that kind of stuff.
It did feel great, having someone to talk about those kind of issues without
really worrying that she'd see me any different.

"Some day you gotta teach me", she said,
"You gotta keep talking how things are for you and what changes you'll like
to see—because yesterday I was shocked at the many stuff happening around you
that I didn't know, I mean, I know they happen, but it rips me apart when it
happens to you.

"Enséñame a ser mejor aliada/compa/buddy."

What was it that I was telling her about?
Maybe my insecurities with dating?
I think I remember mentioning her about that Airbnb room that denied me
after I disclosed being trans.

"You're not my trans woman friend, by the way.
Siempre que hablo de ti es como mujer.
Jamás menciono mi amiga trans.
A nadie le he dicho eso.
Just so you know."

I remember a couple of years ago when Monica, my ex,
was the only person in my life that had taken my transition badly.
For a good time in my life, I really thought I would never talk to her again.
I remember having these sort of dreams where we would reencounter
and make ammends.
I'd wake up with this nostalgic and melancholic pain in my heart.

Same thing with Anahi; after that trip to Mexicali and knowing she had
blocked me, I thought it was it for her.
Maybe something similar will happen with Flore?

That is such a stupid idea.

The only way that I continued talking with Molly after those cancelled plans
and leaving me stranded was my stupid joke.

I blocked Catherine last night for some reason.

I got another message from Eusebio that they're both leaving Saturno behind.
Issues with their other business partner.

I sat in _Parc Jeanne-Mance_ with my book and headphones waiting for Hao-Ting.
I looked at people walking in the park.
There were a lot of people doing sports and riding bikes.
I fantasized about somehow seeing a french girl riding a
red bike wearing a red flowery dress.

She would just ride past me without any care in the world.
I would not be able to do anything but follow her with my sight until
she disappears in the horizon.

### Sunday, August 22nd, 2021
_Hay algo que no te he contado, o sea, a nadie.
Nadie.
No sé si hay algo que contar, pero ayer que te dije que estaba leyendo el
diario me acordé.
Y ahorita que mencioné a Flore, igual._

I sent Monica a picture of Aliza and one from Flore.
They were both looking to the right, with short hair and a faint smile.
Yersterday I reviewed the previous days from this journal.
It was weird reading about the night after the party I met Molly.
Or how I would talk about matching up with Flore
the nervousness and excitement of our first date.
Those moments of anxiety due to her silence after my message seemed like
a foreshadowing of what would later come.

I had opened Whatsapp, specifically the window with all of the contacts.
I clicked on her name as if something different would appear.
I was perplexed when something unusual actually did.
Under her picture and name, the words *Online* appeared.
For a moment I paused, as if I needed to think what to write.
As if writing a message to be read was a good idea.

Maybe an hour ago I was browsing Bumble when Molly's picture came up filling
the screen.
The first instinct was to take a screenshot and get out of the app.
I sent the image to both Armando and Monica.
Their reactions were a bit different, but still they shared the same idea.

Nothing happened after I swipped right.
Was I really expecting something to happen?
At least now I didn't make the mistake of closing the app with nervousness
over and over until the profile disappeared.
Swipping left, I'm sure I would have obsessed over the question of
what she had done when seeing my profile.
Now, I'll know if she does swipe right.
Althought, to be honest, I don't know what I'd do after that, anyway.

"You're going to look stalkerish, and obsessive", warned me Monica.

I'm pretty sure I have already crossed that bridge with my stupid joke.
Armando is right, though.
Her reply was too dense to be sincere.
Of course she knew what I was referring to.
Maybe.

Alda didn't come last night, according to Armando.

I didn't want to get up in the morning.
I stayed in bed until noon.
I woke up around 9h without any motivation to do anything.
I masturbated and tried to go back to sleep in the heat of midday.

I put on some shorts and went to the _dépanneur_.
I bought myself two bottles of wine to drink while I watch the Evangelion movies.
Last night I saw the first one.
Right now I'm watching the last one.

I put on a meme on Instagram to see who would look at it.
Nobody special liked the picture I posted yesterday-or was it Friday?

I upped the age limit of the apps, but I haven't gotten any special new matches.
Aren't matches supposed to be people that I feel attracted to?
A couple of them I left in there without any intention to message.
I had maybe other two in the evening, but I don't feel any need to contact them.
There is this girl that I actually liked, but I've ran out of _likes_ to give.
I'll have to wait 12 hours before I can swipe right again.

I actually snoozed Bumble after Molly's-right-swipe fiasco.
I thought that it wouldn't really make any difference and cancelled the
suspension.
I should get off them in any case.
I don't see any people that I'm really interested in meeting.

I keep going back to Flore's deleted conversation.
God, I'm so pathetic.
It's been half of a month and I still keep thinking about these girls whom
I have met, literally, once.

Alice, Molly, Flore.
None of them have I really met for more than a third of a day.

I'm still not sure if I should go tomorrow to the lab or stay home and work
from here.
Maybe I could wait until Tuesday.
Tomorrow there might be a Neuro meeting.
I think all of this week is still Louis holiday.
This week is still Flore's.

I have my answer.
She's still haven't connected once to Telegram making it pretty obvious that
she's deleted it.
She connected to Whatsapp, so she's surely received my pathetic SMS.
She denied the desperate Facebook request.

I should work.
Focus on my project.
Maybe learn to be on my own for once.
I surely do need that.

### Monday, August 23rd, 2021
_Hey, Flore. Sorry if I seem too pushy._

I checked the same apps and the same contacts lists around 20 times before
falling asleep.
Just typing what I remember of the draft of the message in my notes,
I feel cringy.
I knew it was a bad idea to begin with.
I started having this headache due to the red wine.
I sent random messages to strangers in Tinder.
I don't remember the exact time I fell asleep.

I couldn't get up from bed.
I hid my face under a pillow to cover from sunlight, from the world.
I don't think I got any new matches.
I did get a message from one of the matches that I didn't contact.
The other girl had started travelling and her distance kept increasing.
She's now 500 kilometers from me.
She looked too much like Sonny.
Too masculine.
This morning I saw she added how she doesn't wear make-up nor dresses.

I have a date this Thursday with M.
She's this half-moroccan girl who's also just broken up with her gf from Dubai.
I don't feel attracted to her pictures, but I need the distraction.
I am such a piece of shit sometimes.
I just hope I won't do what Flore did to me.

I told Monica yesterday that I wasn't sure about deleting Molly and Flore
from my contacts.
For the former, I thought I would look even worse if I suddenly unfollowed
her from Instagram.
For the latter, I just didn't want to.
I think it was also yesterday when I saw Molly's profile in Bumble.
Yes, I wrote about it.
I remember now.

Had I already deleted them when I saw Molly on Tinder?
I swiped right, even though yesterday I had realized it was a bad choice.
It's like somehow I expected something to happen.
Minutes later when Alda appeared, I didn't make the same mistake.

I sent Alda a message and we chatted for a bit.
She offered me to apply to her job as a tutor.
There would be a 1k dollar referral bonus that we could split.
I found it so hard to work today, that it wasn't difficult to realize
it isn't the best idea.
At least not for now.
Maybe after I talk with the counselor.

I erased Molly's number with ease.
Flore's was harder.
I kept checking WhatsApp, until her name stopped appearing.
There is still that image of the message I sent her with her phone in it.
Even then, there is still the contact information in Telegram with her
phone number inside.
Even now as I try to remember the draft of the message I wanted to send,
even with my own permission to rewrite it now,
I couldn't come up with anything that didn't seem so pathetic.
There is nothing left to tell her.

If she wants to, she just needs to reopen Telegram and I would be right there.
I don't think it's going to happen.

I did have a new match, even a new message.
It was this girl from Bumble.
A photographer coming from Australia in her thirties.
I forgot about her until half of the 24 hours I have to reply had passed already.
There is no reply back.
I tried rematching with the other french girl who let the time run out.
I need to pay.
There's no point.
Why didn't I delete the match?

I keep talking about this stuff.
Matches, messages, Tinder and Bumble, dates.
It's such bullshit.
The only person with whom I was open and told her about being trans
I left hanging in her dinning room.
It is my card under my sleeve.
Whenever I see the situation with M going nowhere I can just come out and
let her end things herself.

Sometimes I can feel so alone.
For a minute, I even forget that I deserve it.

I put the last movie again.
I couldn't do a single productive thing the whole day.
I cooked dinner, I guess.
Although I really considered just having a bowl of cereal and an apple as
my food for the whole day.
Tomorrow I'll go to the lab and make a stop at the supermarché.

I chatted with Antonija today in Instagram.
We exchanged some messages of our lives as grad students after I reacted to
her story.
It was nice.
We lived in the same dormroom for, what? Two weeks?
Or was it three? No, just two.
She probably must have known that I am trans, right?
We literally changed in the same room.

Why do I feel the urge to come out now?
Maybe I should note it down and mention it in two weeks when I
finally see the counselor.

### Tuesday, August 24th, 2021
"¿Qué hongo, ya vas de loquilla?", asked me Armando.

"Tengo una cita el jueves, otra el viernes y ahorita quedé en 20 minutos de
verme con alguien.
Bien que juzgaba a la Molis y estoy igual."

Yesterday I was on Zoom with Sonny.
She was setting up her new MacBook and I was with her.
She looks so pretty with her shorter hair.
It's not like that undercut that I secretly hated.
Still, I don't think I feel attracted to her.
I don't think I feel that attracted to anyone.
Not like I did that time.

I figured out how to delete Flore's contact from Telegram.
I did it now, she's gone.
Because she was the first one to text me, I didn't add her,
so her name was the one she chose.
I added her contact later, after she had already stopped replying.
That's when I saw her on Whatsapp.

I added her contact again under the name _french fry_.
Maybe I should delete that, too.
As I was typing the previous paragraph I thougth about today's date and
how I would wish to have a second one with her.

_Hey, I guess you deleted Telegram.
I don't really know what happened, but if someday you wish to meet up again,
give me a call._
God, that is so pathetic even now I am cringing.

"Respétese, mujer" said Armando that time.

As I told Monica, I should just imagine that she cut her hair again.
What does it say about me that the of her pictures that I really liked
were from years ago?
Maybe I do have an issue with younger women.

I couldn't get out of bed again.
Not before noon.
I didn't go to the lab, obviously.
Maybe there is no point in going this week that the heat is unbearable.
I shouldn't even pretend that I'll go tomorrow.

I did go out, though.
I went to get groceries.
I bought a bottle of Jaggermeister with coffe in it.
On the way back I invited Kim to get dinner and beers this Friday.
She's 30.
M, my date of Thursday, is also 30.
I don't feel attracted to her, at all.
Nonetheless, I felt weird telling Miguel and my Mom that I were seeing some
people, when in reality I had just asked Molly out—which did not happen—,
went on one date with Flore—and got ghosted—,
and one failed hook-up with Alice.

Molly was the first gay woman I met here in person.
She was the first person that I've ever asked out.
Of course there would be some meaning behind her.
I'm actually surprised by how little her rejection and drama really affected me.

Although, to be fair, I keep mentioning daily.
And the jokes with Armando have gone for way too long.
It's becoming creepy.

Flore was my first actual date.
I really liked it, I really liked her.
I was surprised by how much I felt attracted to her.
When Monica asked me if I was attracted to Ana after tonight,
I went back to the memory of the chat with Flore at the café,
how I was amazed by how pretty she looked while we waited to be seated.
Maybe I was too awkward then.
How I wanted to be closer to her when we walked by the park.
Maybe she just didn't know how to end the date.

I am sad and disappointed.
How much can I really know her after just a couple of hours?
A month ago I didn't even know of her existence.
She's not here to fix me.

"Where in the city are you located?
Wanna go for a beer at the park Jeanne-Mance like right now?"

After Alice, I knew that this didn't really mean I would spend the night
somewhere else, but I did take my pills in any case.
We chatted for a bit.
She looks prettier than the pictures.
She's not trans.
The conversation didn't flow as easy as I would have wanted,
but it didn't feel like Alice's either.

As I told Monica, even though she herself mentioned doing something later,
if tomorrow morning I can't find her match in the app anymore, I wouldn't be surprised.

Maybe I should just cancel with M.
I don't even know her name.

Last night—or was it the one before?—I saw a couple of girls that were
incredibly pretty.
Maybe I will find some other girl.
Maybe soon I'll stop thinking about the french girl whenever someone mentions
_L'Université de Montréal_.

### Wednesday, August 25th, 2021
_¿Ya empezaste a leer Rayuela?
¿O te tomaste muy en serio lo de leerlo conmigo?
Porque si sí, ahorita mismo lo compro._

I was just telling Sonny about those months befora I met her in
_Ciudad de Mexico_
I used to finish a bottle a week.
I'm not sure, but I think it was also the time when I started cutting myself.

I am starting to feel a little like that.

Yesterday I met Ana, the portuguese girl.
She hasn't deleted the match, so I guess that is a good sign?
Flore never blocked me from anywhere.
That would be a pretty low bar for comparison.
I have a date tomorrow with M and another one with Kim on Friday.
I sent a message to another girl—I can't remember her name without looking—,
I thought she wouldn't reply, but she did one or two hours ago.
I sent a message to Eliseo, the one from Queretaro, not Yaaj.
I might see him in the weekend to help him settle in the city.
I know I could have used someone when I just arrived to the city.

Alda invited me to go to this party on Friday.
It was Jose's house, the creepy guy in his thirties—or is it his forties?
I asked her if Molly would be there.
_Cuz I'm afraid I would actually die from cringe_.
She told me that she didn't think so, but she could ask Vix.
I said it was fine, I wouldn't want to avoid her anyway.
Deep down I felt a little bit disappointed, to be honest.
What the fuck is wrong with me?

After returning last night from Ana's date,
I couldn't think of a single reason why the night was off,
or why would she not be interested.
Yet, I don't think I've ever felt as lonely.

It's not even 20h and I am drunk already.
I could not get out of bed this morning either.

I got a message from Armando, very similar to that one of the dirty toilet,
but less embarrasing.
I left the stove all dirty with oil from yesterday.
I saw it and sent a thumbs up before burying my face back under the pillow.
This time I didn't feel the need to apologize or explain myself right away.
A couple of minutes later I did anyway.
He reminded me how I had told him to tell me whenever he was annoyed with
something I did.
He was right, I guess.

He asked me if I was OK.
He saw my bottle of jaggermeister in the freezer.
I didn't answer him.

His girlfriend is supposed to be here, but I haven't seen her.
He said she had a busy schedule of visiting some people.

I asked Monica if she had a date already,
and she told me to help her look for flight in October.
She's planning to come for a week.
I remembered my dreams and Aliza's story before I
gave her the option of sharing my queen bed or that she could look up an AirBnB.

"Obvis contigo. Me ofendes."

I don't remember most of yesterday's dream except this particular scene.
There was this girl taller than me.
We got real close together.
Was she whispering something in my ear?
I didn't know where to put my hands.
I placed them on her lower back as soon as I felt her fingers.
I guess I was wearing a skirt, given I remember feeling her fingertips
digging in my underwear.
Did she say something then?
I don't think we kissed.
I felt her.
I couldn't breathe.

At least this time I wasn't a man.

I just grabbed the phone to check if this girl have replied.
I remember she's 25.
Is she still too young?
I didn't think about looking at her name again.
I could always set up something for the weekend and just postpone
Eliseo's meeting.
I should had looked up somewhere for tomorrow.

I wonder if the best thing would be for me to cancel.
I am not interested in this girl at all.
To be fair, I doubt she's into me anyway.
It'll just be another hour or two out of the house.
Another experience or event to tell the counselor.

Another person to make me feel more lonely.

There are ants crawling up my leg.
Like last night that we were sitting on the grass and Ana used that excuse
to get away.
Why wasn't I more forthcoming, wasn't that the plan?

_De seguro te dicen_ Sofi Sobres.

She already knew I was trans.
Alice did as well and, instead of grabbing her hand or her waist,
when she returned from her room, I apologized and left.

Am I expecting something from these girls?
If I tell them beforehand...
If they knew and accepted me the following rejection would hurt even more.

I am not even sure that the reason Flore disappeared was because I am trans,
and yet it broke me.

Is this it? Am I really broken because of this one girl and this one night?

I've been broken so many times, maybe it's just that in all these years,
I've never really put myself back together.

### Thursday, August 26th, 2021
_Sofa, just want to reassure you...
you're worth all the friendships in the world to me, girl.
You da real MVP._
- Monica

I quoted a message from two days ago telling Monica that I wouldn't be
surprised if Ana would suddenly just delete the match and, with it,
our conversation.
Our date didn't go that well.
It wasn't bad, as I told it here, but it was nothing special.

I finished again all my available likes running out of all the people nearby.
I had 18 matches after two new girls:
a spanish one to whom I feel no attraction whatsoever
and another one who was looking for a roommate for her recent move into MTL.
Then the number was 17.

Monica's message triggered something in my chest and a muted scream came
crawling to my throat.
I was really close to crying, but in the end nothing happened.
I went to the kitchen and drank two shots of Jaggermeister.
Last night I was really drunk, I slept most of the night, except I didn't.
I was sweaty and cold.
I turned off the AC at around 4h.

I didn't get up until after 10h, and only because I got a message from Ana.
The neurologist in the lab, not the portuguese girl.

I wanted to kiss her, I was a little bit attracted to her, was I?
I was—pleasantly—surprised she wasn't trans.
Maybe she felt the complete opposite way.
Maybe they need time to reflect and realize they are not interested in
pursuing something with someone like me.
After all, I did agree to go out with Alice, and it wasn't until a couple of
hours into the night that I decided to leave.

Maybe it has nothing to do with me being trans and it's just that I am an
unattractive and boring person.

Around noon I wondered if I should send M a message.
Perhaps she wouldn't follow up and the date would just never happen,
something like what happened with Molly.
She did send up something not much later. _Are you still up for tonight?_

I had it right there, the perfect chance to cancel out.
I've criticized harshly Molly and Flore for not being direct,
there was the perfect moment.
_No, sorry, I'm not feeling it tonight. Nothing personal._

I confirmed it and proposed a time instead.
I'll see her in Le Darling at 19h30.
She sent me her phone number like I did with both Molly and Flore.
Her name is Minas.
Probably I'll have something to talk about.
Maybe I can be my own depressed self right now and let things run their course.

I thought about cutting up the alcohol a little bit,
but I am drinking again and it's not 17h yet.

Maddy.
The name of that other girl who hadn't replied is Maddy.
I got a response from her yesterday.
She ended her reply with a question and I answered back with a paragraph.
It went unreplied as well.
Probably that will be the end of the interaction.

I reduced the number of matches even more.
I deleted all of the old ones.
I removed the unreplied messages.
From 50 or something, there's around a dozen.
I could reduce it even more,
but I thought I should left a couple in there just in case.
It's not like I expect a response,
but just to give them the opportunity to see what I actually wrote.

It's almost the end of the month.
The 26th.
I have the appointment with the counselor the Tuesday after the next one.
I don't think I am actually going to make it.
At least the Jaggermeister bottle won't.
It's almost half empty.
I invited Alda to grab from it whenever,
but I'm pretty sure that was a subconscious way to meddle up with the idea
that I finished it so quickly.

I am starting to feel dizzy.
I ate.
I had a bowl of cereal and a sandwich.
I was half-drunk when I went to that date with Ana and it made no difference.
I wasn't charming enough.
I was uncomfortable, insecure, unattached.
I wasn't enough.
I felt no need to pursue a second date,
and yet I do feel hurt by the clear answer that there won't be one.

Isn't that what I wanted?
Would receiving a message from Flore right now, stating something like
_I'm sorry for not replying. I just didn't feel it. Nothing personal.
would help me feel better?

I am such a hypocrite.

Maybe I deserve to feel like shit.

### Friday, August 27th, 2021
I'm going to do what I used to do some time ago.
Those times when I would just go out late at night being sure that I would not
be able to make it back home in time to finish the words.
The streak was too important.
I didn't want it to let it die.
Even with this new girl that doesn't seem that interested
I don't want it to let it die.
It's like a plant that I'm sure if I care for it enough I can bring back to life.

People are nice.
That's my main miscalculation.
Growing up a boy and trying to fulfill that role in society I
hadn't realized that women are taught to be nice and polite.
They won't reject me in a direct way.
Even thought they are pretty sure they're not interested,
they'll still carry on the conversation or continue asking questions.
That's what society teaches them.
That's what it didn't teach me.

This is my third, and last date of the week.
If nothing comes up with Maddy—which it probably won't—,
I'll keep off all of this at least until I get a better hang on my mood.
Maybe after the session with the counselor.

I keep talking about that first session as if it's going to be this magic
thing that will make everything better.

I met Kim today.
Were yesterday's words before or after my date with Minas?

Sonny asked me where I was, what I was doing.
I didn't tell her outright.
It wasn't until after she asked further, that I mentioned the dates.

"Three in a month..."

"More like three in a week."

I'm getting distracted.
I'm now quite drunk watching John Oliver with my roommate.
I don't think I'm going to be able to finish the words.
I have less than 20 minutes.

I started mentioning more and more to Sonny.
She asked me if I went to the party,
the bachata party that would be at the place of the guy that kissed Molly.
I told her that there's been a lot that I haven't told her.

"A quien me tengo que madrear?"

Right now I feel the need to tell her that Molly's not the one that hurt me.
And here comes Flore again.

I told Monica a little bit about yesterday's date.
Before I went, when I was feeling a little bit self-conscious about my skirt.

I returned back home to grab a sweater.
Not just because I felt the breeze, but because I thought people—or men?—would
ogle me.
They didn't really.
And I didn't know how to feel about that.
Was it because I'm not attractive?
If I looked like a man in drag, they would notice.
So I guess there's at least that.

My mind is blank now.
10 more minutes.
I still need 250 more words.
Alda went to her sister's for more rolling paper.
I'm not high, but I'm drunk.
I told Kim that I was drunk already, but I wasn't.
Not really.
I wanted it to be like yesterday with Minas when after we confessed we were
drunk stuff just got easier.

I am drunk right now, though.
I drank more of my jagger and some of Alda's rum.
The bottle is almost empty.
She hadn't had anything.
She's just tasted it today and she didn't even liked it.
It's all just me.
Maybe I could start the session with that.

_A couple of years ago, my friends back home literally thought I was an alcoholic.
I drank a bottle of liquor a week. I started cutting myself.
I'm starting to feel like that again._

I want to get high.

I told Elíseo to remind me about tomorrow, because I'm really drunk.
We're going to go somewhere to eat.
I'll be there for him as nobody was for me when I came.
I might have said this already.

100 more words, 5 minutes.
I was telling Monica about today's and last night's date.
I don't know what to expect.
Minas touched me a lot. She was flirty and reassuring.
Even though she's not my type, I was interested.
Maybe I should be more like that.

maybe if I were more into it, more touchy, more direct,
Kim would not delete the match.
Maybe something different would have happened with Flore.

Will I tell Sonny about Flore?

I shouldn't.
I can't do that.
For fuck's sake, I can't believe I'm actually considering it.
I'm such a shitty person.

Deal with your own shit.

### Saturday, Augusth 28th, 2021
_Thanks for coming out to meet me yesterday!
It was nice to meet you.
I didn't really feel it click that way though despite it being a nice time.
I wish you luck on your search!_
- Kim

Sixteen hours ago I was sitting in this same place with Alda to my side.
We had just returned from smoking around the dog park.
We sat inside the park, on a bench for a while.
She talked a bit more about Vix.
He had said something about Samantha.
She was hesitating about going to the party.
I didn't want to go, not really.
It would be filled with straight people.
I don't even like dancing.
I just wanted to do something, to stay busy.
Distract myself from what is going on inside me.

Walking home, I didn't have a clear idea that something had gone wrong.
I noticed her disengaging, but to be honest, I thought it was from her pain.
Her rejection message wasn't a complete surprise either.
It was what I wanted, wasn't it?
I wanted them to be open and direct.
She didn't give me any empty suggestions of meeting again,
she didn't ignore my messages nor deleted the conversation.

It still hurt.
I started to cry and my meal didn't taste like anything anymore.
Maybe I am the problem.

I was sitting in this same spot when I started passing out.
Years ago it happened, I closed my eyes and felt the world outside spinning
around me.
Months ago, the sensation was similar to life literally being extracted out
of my body.
I fantasized that it was me being transported to another place in time.
A perfect opportunity to go back and do things differently.

When I was with Alda sitting on the bench,
she confessed that she was the one who told Vix about Molly.
She told him how she was unsure about inviting me to Molly's party.

"Yeah, my roommate asked her out and nothing happened,
now I'm worried if things are going to get awkward".

She was annoyed that then he would later ask me directly why I had not gone.

I thought for a moment to tell Armando, or Monica.
what is the point?
They don't really care about it.
I shouldn't either.

I posted a 3 second video of me when I was waiting for Kim.
65 people viewed.
And even though I just said I shouldn't care anymore,
I checked who were those 65 people.
I looked into my followers to see if Molly's still there.
I think about unfollowing her.
I don't know.

I looked for Flore again.
This time there was a red circle around her profile picture in Instagram.
It was hard not to see it, but I don't want to be in her list.
It was just one date weeks ago.
One date, a couple of unviewed messages, and a very hurt and pathetic one.

She was the first date and the one I enjoyed the most.
Maybe the rest didn't work because my mind was still in Santropol,
or on that park bench talking about depression.

It is getting easier, isn't it?

I still feel lonely.
I still feel like crying until there is nothing left inside of me.

There's still 200 words to go, but suddenly I have nothing else to say.

I went to bed around 2h or 3h.
I was passing out on the couch.
I was more drunk than high.
I woke up around 6h or 8h.
I had a response from Kim, but not the one that I quoted.
She was thanking me for wishing she got better.

I also got a message from Maddy.
What is going on with that girl? She replies to my message hours after,
but in there it seems like a sincere wish to keep the conversation going.
I thought about joking that it seems like we're writing each other letters.

I just replied back.
I dreamt that she had matched with Alda,
and was telling me that before going out with me,
she'd want to see what happens with my roommate.
It probably came after the thing with Molly, Vix, and Alda.

I just talked a little bit with Monica and said how even though I am OK-ish,
it is hard not to take it personal.
I feel way more alone than a couple weeks ago.
It all started with that stupid party where I liked this girl
and wondered about asking her out.
The date never happened and, instead, I've chat with a dozen people and
gone out on a handful of first dates but never a second.

### Sunday, August 29th, 2021
I woke up with a heavy sense of dread.
Last night I didn't really think that today would be this hard.

I don't remember my dreams: their content or if I had any.
I woke up early in the morning, but still after the sun had risen.
I used the other pillow to cover my head.
I looked at the phone to see if there was anything new at it.
Why would there be?
The dates are over, there are no girls left.
No possible second ones.
They all rejected me.
Was it yesterday when I set up the other app?
I had told Monica that I'd be going on a break for it.
I did snooze Bumble and put my Tinder profile off from being shown.
I set up the other app, Hinge.
I think it was the app that was mentioned by that guy who had brought up
two girls with him to the party.
He had met them on there.
Were there really on a threesome?
Do I want one?
I usually reject those girls who are looking for a third girl.
I mean, even if I wanted to, they're looking for a unicorn,
but that doesn't exactly mean a girl with a _horn_.

I hate myself a bit more than yesterday.

I chatted a bit with Monica.
I told her how I didn't want to get out of bed.
I stayed there until noon.

"Don't", she replied reassurring me.

When I finally did, I changed my shirt for a hoodie and grabbed the tote bag
to go to the _dépanneur_.
I told her I would be buying _cheetos, cookies, ice cream or something gross_.
Deep down, I already knew I was going to be buying alcohol.

This time the cashier did ask me for an id.
I didn't take my passport with me, so I asked if a foreign license was good.
He accepted it.
I'm not even sure he actually looked at it.
I bought 5 cans of cider, 2 of beer and a bag of chips.
That was probably it.

I've drunk half of that stash,
eaten the whole bag of chips and ordered myself a pizza and some fries.

Minas had told me I needed to find me new ways of self-care.
I don't really think this was what she meant, but it's something, I guess.

Will I remember in the future the names of these girls?
This August 2021, my month of dating.
Do I remember the girls I've liked?

Does it matter?
Monica had a point.
When I was still in bed—no, even from last night—she scolded me for my use of emojis.
When I read the message I was annoyed and ignored it.
This morning she mentioned it again and I just rolled my eyes.
I deleted a bunch of pictures and I saw the conversation I had with Kim.
She was right.
It looked so pathetic.
What was I even doing?
That is not me.
I didn't do that with Sonny, nor Catherine nor Monica.
Maybe they all realized that I wasn't being authentic?
Nah, they just didn't like me.
It's absurd to still try to find meaning behind it.

_Acéptalo, tío. No le gustas. Eres feo._

Most times, the simplest answer is the correct one.

Last night I told Monica how I had looked up Flore in Instagram and I saw
a red circle around her profile picture.
It took every bit of will force not to look at it.

"She did get to you, didn't she?"

She later, again, scolded me for looking her up in Facebook.
Again, she does have a point.
I ruined things.
I mean, even though, as I said, by that point she had already deleted Telegram,
that move was completely moronic.
What was I expecting?
Her accepting me and suddenly sending me a message like: _Hey! Sorry,
I had lost my phone in the chalet losing all means of contacting you.
Fortunately you looked me up and now we can continue seeing each other!_

I do need a break.
Not for my own health, but just to grow the fuck up.

I thought about telling her to don't let me go on another date until the end
of the month.
But what would that really do?
I would just hide it from her.

I'm drunk now.
I wanted to finish the words just so I could get down to bed and forget
about this week.
This month.
Two more days of August and I can let all of this behind.
No more dating, no more foreign girls or Flore or Molly.
Just close this chapter,
this desperate stage of my life and move on with my life.

I didn't even make that promise to Monica and I was already ready to break it up.
What makes me think that I'll keep this one to myself?

### Monday, August 30th, 2021
Helena. Her name was Helena Hanso.
Was that her last name?
I didn't look it up.
I could.
I don't think I have her contact anywhere,
but finding her shouldn't be that hard.
I have Johanna, they knew each other, didn't they?
Both of them were in Psychology.

A couple of days ago I told Monica how I had a crush on Antonija,
but yeah, that never really counted, did it?
Now, in hindisight, sure, I wanted to be around her and I sincerely liked her,
but it never got to anything more than that.
From my end, of course.
There's not even a point to question whether she ever felt anyhing.
First of all, she was straight, and second, I am me.

This isn't about her, though.
This all started because I remembered opening the translate app for some
reason and I saw Estonian as one of the languages.
As I am writing this, it was probably due to the Tenet movie that I saw a
couple of weeks ago.
Nonetheless, that small circumstance made me think about that day
in—where was this? Portugal?—when, in the morning, I wrote in a note on my
phone how I had the picture of this pretty blonde girl,
the same blonde girl who was sitting on the bus on our way there.
And close to midnight I was whispering something to her ear after we had
kissed on the dance floor.

She had stopped me after that.
In broken spanish, outside of the party,
she told me how I was a really nice guy, but she just wanted to dance.
At that moment—well, more correctly, the next morning when I had gotten my
consciousness back—I took her words meaning that the kiss was a mistake
and she didn't want anything else but friendship.

Was this before or after our afternoon in Braga?
We roamed the streets of this peculiar portuguese town and she asked
someone to take a picture of us.
It must have been after.
The night I kissed her was the same day I had met her.
Weeks later I would invite her for a day in Salamanca to explore the cathedral.
There must be a second picture of us at the top that was sent to my email.
Did we also met in that house? With the windows? Casa Lis.

On our way home, I hesitated about asking her if I could sit with her.
I gained the courage, and did it.
She didn't say no, but warned me that she'd wear her earphones.
I said there was no problem, and took the seat.
Was that foolish?
I guess I've always been an idiot with these sort of things.

I played with a napkin while she looked out of the window and fell asleep.
I made a flower out of it, somehow.
When we arrived to Salamanca, I gave it to her.
That could have been either sweet or completely stupid.
I wish I could send her a message now and just ask her.
It's been 7 years since then.
Last time I looked her up, she was pregnant.
I don't remember if I had her as a facebook friend before my coming out.
I sure as hell don't have her now.

I was obsessed with her for a while.
I remember months later, as I listened to this song,
I would think about that night where I looked at her while we danced
and her face would change.
Her eyes would look so familiar, even though I hadn't met her before.
I got closer and closer, and we would pull away while holding hands.
We would lower down to the floor in laughter and just come back up
and get close to each other.
We kissed maybe once or twice.

It was another day, maybe even a different trip?
No, we were on this beach of Portugal,
and she would get her feet in the ocean and write on her little notebook.
I remember now how I used to wonder if I were in that notebook of hers.

Would she think of me, now, years later?
Does she know—or even imagine—that I look nothing like that guy with messy
curls and sad eyes?

After months I stopped thinking about her.
I moved back home to continue my drama with Catherine, Monica, and Sofia.
Maybe it will be like that.
A couple of months from now, I'll look back to this month and laugh about my
obsessiveness, the drunk messages that should had been deleted and
the overly-affectionate emojis.

### Tuesday, August 31st, 2021
After months of worries, I think everything is finally settled.
Is there anything else to worry about?
I have a Dr who supervises my HRT.
I have an apartment, with a signed lease until next year.
All of the official documents have been received and cleared.
Both vaccines have been registered in the vaccine passport app.

Why do I feel more anxious and depressed than ever?

I, again, like most of the previous days,
found it almost impossible to get out of bed.
I closed the drapes and returned to lie down around noon.
I didn't even bothered to pretend that there was any possibility that
I'd be going to the lab.
Ironically, today I did more than this whole previous month.

Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Louis on teams where he will train us
in how to do QC on structural images.
I find it extremely hard.
I built this app just for that, but I have never really done QC before.
My whole master's project is built upon poor quality data.
All of the results that I defended in my thesis are worthless.

Diego just now defended his master's.
Did he finish on time unlike me?
I must have, because he's enrolled in the PhD.
It doesn't matter.
Eliseo mentioned he thought I had a background in engineering or maths given
I'm known for how well I code and shit.

I, even now, don't really know how to feel about that.

If I could go back in time, what would I do different?
I'm sure I would not had enrolled in electronics in high school.
Thinking about choosing something different to communications science
makes me uneasy.
On one hand, that'd mean that I would have never developed a relationship
with Monica.
On the other, maybe without knowing her I wouldn't have had something to
distract me from the dysphoria.
Perhaps, if I went into Informatics instead,
I would had tried to enroll in a computer sciences program.
Surrounded by men would surely made my egg break sooner.

Who knows, maybe I would have transitioned sooner, too.

I asked Monica, again, if she had thought about the dates.
My intention was to have more information for my decision about whether
or not ask Louis for a time-off.
I'm not being functional, at all.
This week I, almost on my own, finished the Jaggermeister bottle.
I've been getting drunk almost daily.
A couple of days ago, as I was putting the cutlery and plates on their place,
I stood in the middle of the kitchen with the chef's knife over my leg,
over those scars.

I hate myself. I feel disgusting and worthless.

I imagine conversations that will never happen.
Just talking.
I've talked with Monica this past month more than ever.
Even with Sonny,
after I said we would stop talking in the beginning of this month,
I've done nothing but over-share.
It's so unfair. I am such a hypocrite.

I said, to myself and Monica and Armando, that I would stop with the apps.
I assured, once and again, that I needed a break.
The last match that I had on Tinder replied to me every other day.
She has a boyfriend, for fuck's sakes.
What do I expect from that?
Monica told me to not mess with Paty after I told her she had a girlfriend.
And here I was, talking to this stranger.

I should stop talking about that.

I need to. It's not doing anything good for me or my mental health.
I am sick.
I am not well right now.
I need help.
I'll get it soon.
I ought to at least ask Louis about the time off.

I have the clear to start using the Niagara server from ComputeCanada.
I have the deskulled images ready and even a random subset for the templates.
I have some simple tasks to complete for Qrater and the Documentation that
I've been postponing over and over.

I have no reason, nor excuse, to not get up tomorrow and start working.
I received that dreadful note that a package could not be delivered.
It's the coffee order.
I can pick it up tomorrow after 13h.
The meeting with Louis and the team will be at 15h.
I can make a stop at a _dépanneur_ and replenish my beers.
Maybe a bottle of wine, instead.
The one not close to home, I've been there too much.
I don't want them to recognize me.
Last time they asked for an ID.

Do I have a problem?

Again?

## September, 2021

### Wednesday, September 1st, 2021
I am not that drunk,
and yet I struggled to grasp an initial thought to put in writing.
I have been drinking, again.
Well, not drinking.
Not as much as a couple of days ago.
Just a small glass of rum.

Yesterday my coffee was supposed to arrive,
but either I didn't hear the guy knock at the door or they went
straight ahead and put the notification in the mailbox to just go pick it up.
I don't remember the last time I actually brewed coffee.
I have been waking up around noon, tired and depressed.
Today was no exception.

Again, I opened the apps as if I were to find something new and exciting.
This is now borderline compulsive.
For what?
Going on another date where I'll be all nervous and awkward and the girl
won't just feel it clicking.
Maybe Monica has a point and I should just put it in the bio.
The two dates in which the other girl knew I was trans were the ones
that went better.
Minas and Alice.
Both ended up being inconsequential, but it had to do more with my own issues
than anything else.
Minas wasn't really my type,
and I saw in Alice what I fear everyone will see in me.

I deleted my account.
There were more than 99 likes,
but most of them were from men or from people that I swiped left.
The internet said that closing and opening an account is cause for banning.
I used the _banned from eBay_ story to talk to this new girl in Hinge.
I actually thought that app would be different,
but, after a couple of days, she's the only one with whom I chatted.
The other girl, Sophie, just opened the chat but didn't really reply.
Nobody else.

I finished logging the finances in my bullet journal and reviewing the
entry of August 1st a saw a small little note stating that Molly 'cancelled'
the date.
Below that it says "Monica thinks I came too strong".

Even since that first girl, I've been screwing it up.

I showered around 13h.
I served myself a bowl of cereal and toast with peanut butter.
I thought I could do some work before the meeting, but I couldn't.
I just wasted some time before the meeting.

Last night I read the first chapters of Rayuela.
I talked with Sonny about it.
Today, I hesitated about telling her that I deleted Tinder.
Why would she care?
She does.
She doesn't want me seeing anybody.

Once I asked her why did she wanted to keep talking to me.
I was thinking about Ana and her sudden lose of interest,
or Kim and her kind rejection, or Flore and her disappearing.
None of them were interested in talking with me after meeting me.
We talked, I gave my best—did I, really?—, but it wasn't enough.
What was different with her and our first date?

She then said that it doesn't really matter how she sees me.
Because she's irrelevant now.
I was very irritated with her text.
She apologized but we stopped texting for the night.

Now that I think of those messages she has a point.
She likes me, she finds me attractive, she doesn't care that I am trans.
Why do I think that that doesn't count?

On the way to the post office inside the pharmacy I stopped at the SAQ.
I bought a bottle of rum.
On the way there and back,
I stumbled with a few of women that I found very attractive.
Does anyone ever think that way about me?
Why would they?
If they do, it's because they don't clock me;
whenever they would, they'd change their mind.

I don't think I am going to work anymore today.
I should not eat anymore.
I cooked myself a bowl of pasta.
Would it be a good idea to read?
I don't really feel like it.
Not even drinking more feels like something I want to do.

I don't know what else to write about.
Tomorrow I'll have a meeting with Louis.
I should ask him how things are going to change now that the semester has started.
Maybe going in person to the lab will be a required thing now.
I could ask him about my time off.
With how much anticipation should I request my week?

Monica said she'd be telling me whenever she has any news.
Will she really come?

Maybe the weeked I'll be having a videocall with my family.
I don't know what I'll tell them.
Will they be able to notice I'm not well?

### Thursday, September 2nd, 2021
Every day is as hard as the last.
Things have not been getting easier.

Things were a bit easier.
I got up before noon.
I don't remember if I dreamt something.
I probably did.
Probably the reason that made me get out of bed was that I had the new coffee
bags to try.

I didn't start working first thing as I should, but I did more than usual.
I had my one-on-one meeting with Louis this afternoon so I had to have
something to tell him.
I managed to run MAGeT, at last.
I had set up the deskulled images and the subset of 21 random subjects.
I could not set up the module from the CobraLab.
I sent a message to Neda, hoping that there was something I could do on my
own without having to contact someone on Mallar's team.
Sadly, I had to sent an email.
He replied back quickly.
Everything is supposed to be running now.

I got up earlier, but I also started drinking early, too.
I remember how, when I was in Mexico City at my lowest,
I sent Eusebio a picture of a half-empty bottle of Licquor.
Months later, after the Christmas Party fiasco he would remind me that he told
me not to joke with alcohol with him.
Did I send the picture as a joke or was I asking for help?
I don't remember his response nor the message I sent.
Maybe I did make a stupid joke, I probably did.

I remember realizing I had a problem when I bought a bottle a week.
The rum that I bought yesterday is almost done.

Alda came to the direction of my room around noon.
She had a glass of orange juice in her hand.

"I know it's too early to drink,
but do you remember that drink we had the other night?
Amaretto, it's really good with orange juice".

I had a couple of sips.
She said something about me having it before she left,
but I gave her the glass back anyway.
I thought it would be better for me not to start drinking.

I served myself a glass of rum and ginger-ale soon after.

I got drunk really fast.
Not boozed; not more relaxed, nor dizzy; just drunk.
It was around 13h.
Two hours before my meeting with Louis.
Would he notice it?
I grabbed an apple and a cereal bar to ease it up a bit.
After the meeting, I made myself a meal.
I kept drinking.
I still am.

A couple of nights ago, Alda came up again in Tinder.
I don't know why, but still I felt uneasy somehow.
Would Molly feel the same way if she saw my profile?
Is this how it is when you see someone you know in those dating apps?
Maybe that's how Vicky felt, too.
Maybe she panicked as I did.
Both of them swiped left, as I did with Alda.

I'm seeing Bo Burhnam's movie, Eight grade.
I remember reading a review somewhere about how great it was for him to capture
exactly what it's like being a middle school girl.
Is that why I wanted to see it?
I was never a middle school girl.
Maybe I could see how different it is from what I experienced.

The most pathetic thing I did today was look up if it was normal for me not
to get any matches in Hinge.
I do have some, though.
I got the like from that guy.
And then I got the invitation to chat from that other girl with my same name.
My message stayed unreplied.
The second match was with Gwen.
Is that her name?
I had matched with her earlier this year,
I think I was still living in that studio.
Recently I came up with her profile again after I started deleting the old ones.
I didn't delete hers only because she's trans.

I told Monica I deleted the apps.
I did.

I also deleted Flore's contact.
Again.
How would I feel if some of the girls I stopped texting with just suddenly
added me on Facebook?
It wouldn't be the same.

Or maybe it would be.
Who cares...

I care.
That's the whole issue.
I should not care.
I should not get attached.
That's the problem.

I got the e-mail from the counselor today.
I sent an e-mail to Louis telling him that I could not go to the
meeting with the funding-guy because I have an appointment with a counselor.
Hopefully it helps.
It probably won't.

### Friday, September 3rd, 2021
_Güey, yo a ti ni te topo._

I somehow remembered the nail prop Alice went to her room to pick up and show me.
Before that she was proud about the reception that her post had gotten on reddit.
I made a mental note to remember her username.
Why? I never looked her up.
That'd be creepy and invasive.
I had forgotten her user by now.

So, I looked her up today.
I was nervous about what I'd find.
Maybe she'd posted something on r/traaaaaans,
about that disaster of a date she had recently with another trans girl.

_We've hit it off in the chat, so I invited her to my place in the afternoon.
I had swiped right on her because she was obviously trans.
I thought it'd have made things easier.
Before agreeing, she came out to me.
Everything went downhill from there..._

Of course there was nothing.
I mean, there were lot of things.
A lot of posts, and some more comments.
Some of them really successful, others not so much.
It was a relief not seeing any mention of me in the more recent ones.
Then again, I am the one who overattaches way too quickly.

_After leaving me hanging,
she had the gall to send me another message the next day.
Girl, make up your mind!_

Gwen could had been another Alice.
She replied to my message, but not really continuing the conversation.
I uninstalled the app today.
She won't miss me in there.
It'll be like that other girl with a boyfriend.
Maybe I'll reinstall them later in the year.
Maybe, I shouldn't.

This will be a long weekend.
Monday is a day off.

"Oh, yeah, it's labour day."

Today I didn't do anything productive either.
The jobs either failed or died out in the early morning.
I resubmitted them, but, by noon, none of them had restarted.
When I checked later, at least the progress was there.

I bought tickets for the movies.
Ticket, singular.
I'll go alone.
Social distance.
_The seats surrounding yours will be blocked_ or something like that.

After I uninstalled the application I started having a very mild but significant anxiety attack.
I wanted to go to the _dépanneur_ or the SAQ to buy more alcohol.
It's going to be a long weekend.
I showered instead.

When I returned, I bought the ticket.
I'll go on my own and get distracted.
The movie starts at 20h.
It will be the first time that I'll use the vaccine passport.
I went to the movies in DC with...

what was her name again? Nina?
No, Nina was the german girl that was with that brazilian guy.
She was from Taiwan.
No, Hao-Ting is from Taiwan.
After her last message telling me she had decided for the downtown flat,
I never heard from her.
Last night,
as I was tossing and turning after failling to fall asleep post-orgasm,
I started thinking about the girls and their dates.
When did things go wrong?
How many of them is it possible to hear from again?
Why would I want to, anyway?

Monica is supposed to come next month.
_Perhaps I can ask her to take pictures of me to help me make a new profile_,
I thought somewhen.
Why do I want to keep on dating?
I hated every moment of it.
Even if some girl somehow asked me to her place, I would be a disaster.
Even if somehow I tell her about me being trans—like with Minas—,
there wouldn't be any difference.

I am not ready.
I am not lovable.
It's not worth it.
_I_ am not worth it.

"When I asked my physician for the referral,
it was because I'd been feeling not so great recently.
We discarded any possible physical causes so I thought it was the pandemic
and stuff.

"After I actually made the appointment, though,
I think I have started with an episode of depression.
I haven't done any self-harm—I mean, not recently—,
but I have noticed a pattern of unhealthy coping mechanisms;
maybe even self-destructive.
I've been binge drinking a lot.
I also went on a lot of dates, at least a lot to me.
Like three or four girls a week.
It just made me feel more alone."

The bottle of rum is empty.

Yesterday I saw the Bo Burnham movie Eight grade.
I remember somewhere stating that it was a perfect portrayal of the life of
a tennage girl—I think I wrote this exact sentence yesterday.

Just now I thought about sending a text to Alice.
Has she seen it?
Was she moved by it?
Monica would be against that idea.
I would, too, after sending it.
Fortunately, I deleted her contact number.

My glass is half-empty.
I am starting to get drunk.
I'll grab my book and head to the park,
maybe I can read a little before heading to the theater.

### Saturday, September 4th, 2021
_Hoy me puse a caminar, como si buscara algo.
Entre toda la multitud, me puse a ver sus rostros, sus ojos.
No sé qué era eso que buscaba, pero no lo encontré._

I'm home.
I usually am, but this time I also wasn't.
I could not get up early.
I did not shower.
I went out anyway.
I put on some jeans, I shaved and brushed my teeth.
I had the idea of going to the park again today.
There was no alcohol left at home.
Not mine, anyway.
When I went to the kitchen I saw Armando with a backpack leaving the front door.
Was he going to his lab?
I could ask him, but it's not of my business anyway.

Yesterday, it started raining as soon as I was arriving to Jeanne-Mance.
For a moment I hesitated about just going back home and waiting for my movie there.
I could make a stop in a _dépanneur_ and buy a bottle of wine or something.
I don't remember what was it that made me change my mind.
Was I talking to Monica? Sonny? Maybe a message from one of them.

I stayed under the shadow of a tree wondering, waiting for something to happen.
A lot of people were moving from their places preparing to leave.
Others stayed, as if the rain wasn't happening.
I could be like them.
I walked a bit more and sat under a tree.

"Te puedo confesar algo a _lil bit pathetic_ sin que me juzgues?

"Estoy en el parque, bajo el sol, leyendo.
De la nada me cruza por la mente que va a pasar la francesa en su bicicleta y,
no sé, no sé cómo me siento con eso.
O sea, sí me doy cuenta que ni siquiera cuenta como _ghosting_, fue una _date_,
tres días de _texting_, pero, no lo sé."

Monica was a bit more understanding than usual.
No, not understanding; she was compassionate.
She told me about recently how she took notice of a tall guy in the US.
She regretted not approaching him.
She would tell herself that it was because he was with his sister at the moment,
but she knows that even if the sister wasn't there,
she would probably not had done anything anyway.

I felt a sudden urge to pee.
I remembered that night after the beers with Said.
I peed myself on my way home.
I told the story to Sonny.

"I could had gone and peed like a drunk man on the street, but I didn't."

I felt drunk on my way to the movies.
By the start of it, I was feeling better.
Not better, just not drunk.
I might go to the movies more often.
On my way back I stopped at the dog park.
To whom did I tell about that park?
I think it was the girl with a boyfriend.

This morning, I took a backpack and my book.
Maybe I should had brought a blanket with me.
While I was choosing a tree I saw Armando, sitting on bench with a guy and a girl.
They were having a picnic.
Where was I going when I saw him and sent him a message?
I took a detour to downtown before my destination.
In my message I told him I was busy,
but I don't remember what was it that I was going to do.
I think it was the meeting with Hao-Ting.

Oh, that probably was the charge from 'second cup' that I saw in my bank statement.

I sat under a tree, but I wasn't comfortable.
I stayed there maybe for 20 minutes at most before I decided to move.
I looked at everyone, there were a lot of girls that I found attractive.

I keep deleting sentences.
I am starting to get drunk.

I took a walk around the park before I found a good place to sit.
Another tree.
There were a lot of picnics in the area.
I kept looking at the people, as if I were searching something, someone.
After reading several chapters,
I put the book down and just laid back and watched the tree above me.

For a moment I was brought back to that bench in high school.
Every morning, when my dad would leave me at the entrance,
I would hope to watch Monica enter.
This was the back entrance.
How was it that it changed?
Was it the next semester,
when I would leave my things in the classroom and then go sit at this bench
where I knew she would eventually past by?

I was a creep even back then.

The plan was to, from Jeanne-Mance,
make a stop a the latin supermarché and then at the licquor shop.
I was at the intersection, waiting for the light,
when two girls were running from the other direction.
I thought about just keep walking.
Flore lived around Little Italy.
I could walk by there.

And then the light changed and I changed direction, too.

I was halway there before I realized how stupid my actions were.
Consciously I knew I wasn't going to see her.
And even if somehow did I meet her at some street, what would happen?
Best case scenario she would not see me, or at least recognize me under the mask.
If she did, it would seem as if I were literally stalking her.

Was I?

Just as I got to Little Italy I made a turn.
There were some signs in italian and a cute little park.
I thought about sitting and continue reading,
but the walk was starting to take a toll on my legs.

I just kept coming back, listening to the music and looking at people's eyes.

In some streets I would catch a glance of myself in the reflection.
I didn't recognize myself.
I didn't like it.
I lost count of how many girls I liked.
I, on purpose, put on my mask so half of my face would be hidden.
Even if it were uncovered, even if I looked better, there's no reason to think that any of them would be interested in me.

"You're cute", told me Minas over drinks at Le majestique.

No, it was Le Darling.

I got in at _El Sabor Latino_.
There was a family going out,
so I kept holding the door open for them to exit.
When the kids noticed, they grabbed it and thanked me in french.

"La señora estaba sosteniendo la puerta y no nos dimos cuenta".
I don't remember the last time I was referred to as _señora_.
It sucks, but not as much as _joven_.

I got to the SAQ.
I bought a bottle of Kraken.
I noticed it was 7 dollars more expensive than the Bacardi,
but this time I realized it had 10% more alcohol in it.

Going out, there was this guy that asked me if he could give me his card so
I could buy a bottle of rhum for him.
I said no.

It is my turn to clean the apartment.
I could do it tonight, but probably won't.
Maybe tomorrow.
I could do a couple loads of laundry, too.
I should check the jobs again.
I saw some more emails from compute canada when I got home a couple of hours ago.
Last night, I had an email from Manuel.
He wanted to put me in contact with some guy who's doing TMS.
Instead of responding, I just marked his mail 'unread'.
Maybe tomorrow.
No, Monday.

Tonight, I'll just get more drunk and let myself feel a little.

### Sunday, September 5th, 2021
Ariel.

The name of the girl in DC with which I went to the movies was Ariel.
Like the little mermaid.

She wasn't gay, was she?

Holy shit.
No, of course not.
There are such things as friends.

I was really drunk last night.
Two thirds or maybe even half of the bottle was done the same day that I bought it.
I got up around 4h and drank two glasses of water.
I didn't get up again from the bed until well after noon.
Armando was off again.
Alda, maybe?

I feel alone.
I want to open up the apps again,
as if I'll find whatever it is that I'm looking for in there.
I don't get it, I tried dating, I went on several of them.
None of those made me feel better.
I was nervous, I was unsure and awkward.
Why do I want to keep putting myself through that?

I had alcohol, but still I felt the need to go out and buy more.
It was rainning.
I put on my coat and left, even though the oven was on.
I bought four cans of cider and a bottle of ginger ale.
I made myself some BLT sandwiches and roasted potatoes.

Sonny sent me a message.
She was scared.
Then she did what everyone loves to do,
tell me that she couldn't say what was going on.
It had to be a phone call.
I called her but she couldn't answer.
I felt irritated and maybe even a bit angry.
I had already started drinking.

The call went through and I answered.
She was feeling 'disassociated'.
I remember my own episodes of depersonalization.
I tried to tell her to do some grounding exercises, but they came up wrong.
She was in a car, with her family.
They didn't seem to know what was going on.
They were not probably there with her at the moment.
What she described seemed more like disinhibition.
She had not been drinking nor smoking, so I don't know what's going on.
She then mentioned that she didn't take her fluoxetine today.
Maybe yesterday's either.

Just earlier today I commented on someone's post on Facebook.
She was having dizzyness and blood pressure symptoms after stopping her
sertraline treatment for 10 months.
I might have come overly aggresive in my comment asking her if she had
stopped cold-turkey, as those sounded very similar to the symptoms of withdrawal.
I had googled that sertraline has a very short-life so it's one of the worst
offenders of those symptoms.

She replied to my comment.
I don't know how she felt with it.
When I reread my own reply,
it looked to me as something a guy on the internet would write.
I felt overly disgusted with myself.
As if I wasn't feeling bad already.

Last night I replied back to Manuel's e-mail.

I posted the story on Instagram.
I received some messages from different people.
Melissa, Xhail, Anahi, Mafer.
The first one was from Francisco.
He told me not to be sad, and instead of pretending everything was alright,
I continued the conversation with him.

This morning I checked that picture and it had more than a hundred views.
One of them was from Molly.
I checked her latest story, I guess she's in Paris, after all.
Yesterday I muted her.
I thought about reverting it back, but didn't.

Two days and I'll have my appointment with Calli.
I've been drinking more than ever.
What do I expect will happen?
What is it that I'm waiting for?
I remember back to last month, that week after I asked Molly out.
I could not wait for the week to end and meet her.
It's something similar now to this appointment.
It's as if a one hour—maybe even less?—is going to make any difference.
Suddenly I'll feel better and all of my problems will be solved.
I did start to feel worse after I made the appointment two weeks ago.

Did I start feeling depressed after august?
How funny would it be that starting—trying to, at least—going out with people
was what made me feel this depressed.

Last night I was sitting on the couch,
chatting with Armando on WhatsApp when Alda came in with Brioche.
She left him on my lap while she went to her restroom.
I told Armando, as we were just talking about Alda not spending the night.
I told him that he was not the _brioche_ I was waiting for.

And then I confessed that I have been over-feeling what happened with Flore.
I don't know what was different with her—as I had told Monica—.
He said that _un clavo no saca a otro clavo_,
and had told me that staying on the apps would not help me at all.

I showed him that, this time for real, I had deleted them.

And yet again, I have lost count of how many times, just today,
I have thought about reinstalling and using them again.
Maybe I'll find someone with whom I can fell alone together.

### Monday, September 6th, 2021
Was it last night or this morning that I reinstalled Hinge?
It must have been yesterday.
I opened the app and saw numbers in the bottom banner.
No, that can't be true as, when I reinstalled it,
the app would have deleted all of my matches.

The two of them.
There were two people in my 'likes'.
They weren't my type.
I browsed a couple of people and then just closed it again.

This morning I opened it again.
Now Gwen and the other lady were there.
Nothing new had happened since I deleted it.
I erased the match with the other lady and,
after a couple of minutes of browsing, just uninstalled again the whole thing.

Perhaps I do need another couple of months on my own before trying dating again.

For a moment I thought about going to the lab tomorrow,
but I'll have the appointment with the psychologist in the morning.
I should set up an alarm in case I forget about it.
It would be ironic,
how I've been obsessing about this session for the past couple of weeks
only to sleep through it.

It's supposed to be in the morning, around 10 am.
Maybe I could make a stop at the lab after it.
Just take a walk, get some air and distract myself.
Time goes faster when I am not home.

I was supposed to clean the apartment today.
I sent a message to the group chat yesterday that I'd clean at night or,
more probably, today. I did not.

I did do some laundry.
I washed my dishes and cooked my meal.
I showered and cleaned myself a little.
Does it help?
I hadn't showered in the last couple of days.
I started to feel gross.
It does take a toll on my mood.
I sent a message to Sonny, how I hadn't started drinking until 17h.
The bottle of rhum is empty.
I bought it when I wandered around in Little Italy.
It feels so long ago and just around the corner.
I still haven't finished my drink.
There are two cans of cider in the fridge.

I've been eating way more than normal.
I was sitting on the edge of the bed and I glanced at my thighs.
They look huge and monstrous.
When I took the trash out, I looked at my own reflection on the lift.
I'm not fat, yet I don't like what I saw.
I don't feel comfortable with who I am.
At least not right now.

Sonny just sent me an audio about her meeting with Chong.
They've upped her dosage.
She hasn't been feeling well.
I was a bitch towards her last night.
She called me for help and I got irritated and annoyed.

What a piece of shit can I be sometimes.

I washed my sheets.
Maybe I should had shaved my legs.
That way I'd have something to look up to later at night.
People hype the sensation of freshly shaved legs under clean sheets.
Right now I just want to lie down.
My back is starting to hurt.
It's probably because of how much I've been sleeping.
This morning I woke up around 8h.
I consciously decided to go back to sleep.
I was dreaming something.
I don't remember what it was about,
but I prefered going back to that reality instead of my own.
I remember how I was a man in that one.
Still, it was better there somehow.

Anything is better than how I am feeling.

God, I can only imagine how it would look in the future when
I will come back to these logs and read this pathetic shit.
Since I restarted this journal I've done nothing but write about how sad I am,
how lonely I am.
When I'm happy is because of the excitement of some stupid date,
or about this girl whom I met and how, I just know, she is going to be different.

This is supposed to unedited writing.
Just 750 words written, something similar to free association.
I've kept coming back and deleting past sentences.
When I want to write Flore's name; when I feel the urge to mention Molly.
Whenever I try to remember the name of those other girls.

_Un clavo no saca otro clavo._

I have Molly muted on Instagram.
I saw today that she's posted another story.
This time I didn't see it.
I should unfollow her,
but that would only show how *not* over that whole fiasco I really am.

She probably never followed up, because, as Monica said, I came up too strong.
Well, no shit, I ain't proving nobody wrong just now.

### Tuesday, September 7th, 2021
I promised I would do my best to make notice of my efforts
and not being too hard on myself.
I would go to the lab, even if just for a bit.
I would try my hardest to do some work.
Any progress would be good enough.

I put the last frozen burrito in my backpack and the book;
maybe I could go to the park after the day, sit in the grass and relax a little.
I did not.

I went to the lab.
I sat and tried to work.
There was Reza in there working on his laptop.
Louis had mentioned he wanted to go.
That shouldn't had made such a difference.
It wasn't like in the hospital in Mexico when I sat on Said's desk and
he would send me a message that he moved my things.
His backpack was on my chair but he moved it as soon as I got in.

I kept my earphones in and logged what I was trying to do in my bullet journal.
The past week went unlogged.
Last night—or was it the night before?—I ordered from amazon a set of
towels because mine was very smelly.
I bought the bathing suit for trying to use the swimming pool.
There were a couple of people's names in the list for the next couple of days.
I might try to go.
At least use it once, see what it is.
Alda really seems to like it.

"Well, my mum knows about what I've been going through.
I also told a couple of my friends.
I think my roommates have noticed, as well.
They_ve made some comments like _are you alright?_',
but I haven't really gotten to the details with them."

After barely two hours, I couldn't focus.
I tried working on the documentation,
but without the images saved in my pc I felt lost.
I resubmitted the jobs to niagara, but they still weren't running.
I browsed the SNIPE code, but it was in Perl.
I managed to connect my laptop to McGill's wifi.
I put down my things and decided to leave.

I thought about buying the camera.
I keep thinking about this place that I photographed a couple of days ago
and posted as a story.
Maybe I should try getting some hobbies.
I liked wandering around the city.
Maybe with a camera I could try looking to places to capture,
have the perfect excuse to walk around and getting tired, distracted.

I walked to downtown to the Best Buy to see if they had it in stock.
I know I could order it online, but there's only the black one.
In Amazon they also have the white one, and it's even 20 dollars cheaper.
In the end I decided against buying it there.
I could instead order a refurbished one for 150 dollars cheaper.
I bought a big bottle of rum instead.

Cider. The correct way to spell it is cider.
There is still a can in the fridge.
I don't think I'll drink it tonight.
I've had a couple of drinks from the rhum.

"I see you bought a big bottle of Kraken."

I won't be doing anything productive today.
I had the appointment with the psychologist.

I told her my story,
opened up and managed to hold back the tears three times in the
hour-and-a-half session.

I even told her how I am scared that three years ago, after getting drunk,
I started cutting myself.

I'll see her again in two weeks.
I promised I would do my best to go to the lab and forgive myself
for not being well.

I broke down crying on my walk home.
It was less than a minute, but it happened.

The bathing suit is supposed to arrive tomorrow.
It will probably be like the running belt that I bought and used only twice.
Maybe I should try to get up and run instead.
The second time I walked more than I jogged.
I didn't even finish the whole 5k track.
I am such a failure.

At least in two weeks I'll see her in person.

Yesterday Monica asked me to check the flights for the second week of October.
Will it really happen? She didn't tell me that she'd buy them.

Will I go to Mexico?
What if they don't open the border with the US?
The flight to Mexico is almost twice the cost.
There's still several months until then.

There's still time.
A lot of nights until then.

### Thursday, September 9th, 2021
And, of course, yesterday I forgot about the words.
Exactly when I was feeling the shittiest, like a complete failure.
Precisely the month that I enrolled in the challenge was it the time that
I forgot and such my name will be recorded in the wall of shame.

I was feeling depressed from the night before.
It was the day of my therapy session.
I was supposed to be forgiving myself and be aware of my own emotions.
I was lying in bed and felt like going away.
I started thinking about winter.
Inside of my chest there was this uncontrollable urge to go back home.
Still, maybe going to Mexico wasn't the best idea.
I thought about the nights in the balcony in Salamanca.
Those were the first times that I felt my body slipping away when I closed my eyes.

What was the fantasy I had sitting next to Alda?
My body was trying to slipped through time.
It was the sensation of connection to another dimension,
a different place in the timeline, my timeline.

I walked around the city.
I felt the alcohol starting to embrace me.
It was like a coat, no, like the warm blanket you put over a sick child.
Or the one the EMT put over you after a trauma.

I don't remember much of what I did.
I just wandered around like that time in Little Italy,
except this time I wasn't looking for anything, but rather trying to get away.
The second time I left my room, I didn't go that far.
This time I just sat on that same spot I shared in a Instagram story.
I just sat there and cried.
I was wearing my pajama shorts and a t-shirt without a bra.

I browsed Instagram and, for some reason, I looked at Flore's name.
Again there was a red circle around her name.
This time I didn't have any self-control left.
It was a picture of her on her bike with some piece of furniture tied to her
seat.
The text said something about little dick energy.
Was the picture of her?
At the moment I just thought that she'd look at my name in the list of viewers
and would think that I've been obsessed with her or looking her up.
Then I realized how that wasn't that far from the truth which made me feel
even worse.

I sent several texts to Monica.
They started with this incident but grew into how I had never felt so
alone and broken.
Not much later, I deleted them.
She didn't mention them the next day.

I had a real hangover this time.
The sickness, the sensation that I am a piece of shit,
going to the restroom like four separate times, everything.

I couldn't get myself to do much work.
Even though Louis said nothing in our meeting,
this time I felt it in his voice when he asked for updates on the
documentation and I couldn't give him anything.

"I haven't asked you, do you feel more productive dealing with several stuff
at the same time or are you one of those people who deal better when working
on only one thing?"

I got an e-mail from Google Docs about a presentation that Eduardo
had shared with me.
That made me look up his lab in Slack.
There was this old message asking for an update, it was from two weeks ago.
I got this strange sensation,
like from early this year when he would ask me for updates and I would make something up,
after I had only been sitting on the couch doing nothing for the whole day.

That actually got me working on that data.
I had this crazy idea that I could actually come up with something to tell him.
Instead I went to bed around 1h.
I woke up early, around 7h,
with the sudden realization that I had forgotten something important.
I didn't get up until around noon.

Yesterday I signed up for the pool, 13h30.
I got an e-mail around 11h from Louis asking if we could move our meeting,
either to 15 minutes later or in the afernoon.
Hao-Ting asked me if I could help her move some boxes from Fedex.

I swam for a bit.
I didn't shower beforehand and felt guilty.
I didn't use the complete 30 min.
I went to try the sauna, but it didn't really work.
I came back instead.

Best Buy cancelled my camera order.
It wasn't best buy, though, probably the seller.
I hope.
It would really suck if I somehow still got charged by PayPal.

In the morning, Eduardo did send a message back.
First that he was reading,
and then later another one about how he would reply back later and a casual laugh.
It's almost 22h, and I don't think he answered.
I mean, I did say was depressed and dealing with imposter syndrome and
how I was failure.

I was leaving from my meeting to meet Hao-Ting, when Alda came.
She told me she wanted to drink and eat something because it's the eve of
her birthday.
Right now the idea popped up in my head, _will she invite Molly?_

That is so pathetic of me.

The walk to meet Hao was nice.
She asked me if I had plans for dinner and then offered to cook something for me.
She made dumplings and I thought about Armando.
He doesn't boil them in water, though.
He steams his.
She showed me this trick about drinking the dumpling water after.

"I will tell people,
_Oh I had Sofia over and I made her some dumplings and she loved the water!_"

When I took the lift home,
at the fourth floor a group of girls got in with their dogs.
They apologized, but I told them to come in, anyway.

"Move, so she can go out", one told to another.

It's been more than 5 years since I've been myself,
and sometimes it still catches me off-guard when people gender me correctly.

### Saturday, September 11th, 2021
I'm already in the wall of shame.
What does another missed day matter?

"Were you out on a date yesterday?
When I saw you, you looked dressed up.
Oh, so it was for yourself."

Today is Alda's birthday.
She had asked me if I wanted to do something for her birthday's eve.
The plan was to pre-drink some shots and then we could decide whether
ordering something and staying in the house or looking for somewhere to go.
I secretly wanted the second option.
I wanted to put on a cute outfit and maybe even wear make up again.
Just an excuse to feel pretty.

She sent me some google maps entries for live-jazz clubs that we could go to.
I thought I could wear the skirt.
I tried it on but I felt bloated.
There was a lot of fat above my waist.
I went for my usual black jeans instead.
I got my camera,
but decided to wait for the UV filter and screen protector before using it.
Those came in this morning.
Well, not morning, but before I got out of bed.
When I tried the app and the tripod I looked at myself in the pictures,
as the world sees me.
I felt disgusted.
I looked way more thick and chubby than I imagined.
I didn't take any pictures inside and actualy considered not eating for
the whole day.

Last night, after going out but before arriving to the place,
we saw there was some kind of show in a church near the bar.
We went to take a look.
It was some kind of circus performances.
The first one was this woman on some sort of seat(?) hanging from ropes
The second was similar, but way more beautiful.
The music, the movement and lights, I was moved by it.
Entranced.

The third was this guy with a big ring, some sort of hula-hoop.
I was distracted and didn't watch much of it.
Alda told me that her phone had 2% of battery, so she would send me her QR code.
It died before she could.
When we went to the jazz place, the band was barely starting to play.
The host came to us and shook his head as if telling us No.
He told Alda that it was full.
We could go to the terrace, maybe.
He then asked for vaccination proofs.
So we had to leave.
She joked that she was so embarrased as she surely looked like an antivaxer.

We went to this burger place and ordered for pick-up.
We made a stop at Couche-tard, a _dépanneur,_ for some drinks before coming home.
We watched the debate and then smoked a bit before Armando arrived.
Again, he was busy.

I slept.
I slept way more than I should.
I got up around 14h.
Somewhere, someone said or wrote that the hours around noon are the worst
to take pictures, so I didn't consider going out on the walk as I had thought.
Maybe I could go later, work a little first.

I put on yesterday's clothes and looked at myself and noted I was still way
too bloated.

Neither did I go out nor did I work.
I did cook some food.
Way more than a normal meal.

I tested the camera on the balcony.
I took a picture of Stewart, Alda's ashtray.
They came out pretty good.
Although, I posted one on Instagram, and it went without much attention.
I had noticed that before.
When I first opened up my account and posted some 'artsy' pictures,
nobody really liked them.

Selfies—or just pictures with myself in them—get more attention.
I don't really understand why.
Maybe the pity?
Not pity, but the social pressure to like it.

Or perhaps it's just that my pictures are shit.

My arms feel tired still.
I will try to go out tomorrow.
Even if all of my picture spots look like shit,
the walk will be good for my mental, and physical, health.

I drank again today.
I feel a little tipsy right now.
Not really drunk, but still.
I would not drive.

The bottle of Kraken is almost empty.
Will I buy another one?

There was something happening the next 14th.
I don't remember what.
The week after, the 21th, is when I'll see the psychologist again.

I remember her face of concern as I talked about my sadness.
Was it fake?
I mean, I went through that treatment, I've been on her chair, did I fake it?

I still want to talk to her.
Tell her I tried.
I did my best as she said.
I tried to be forgiving and appreciate my best efforts.
I still failed.

### Sunday, September 12th, 2021
Years ago, after one of the first parties I went to after returning, broken,
from Spain, Jessica, Catherine and me were on Eusebio's car.
Where had we gone to?
I was way too drunk.
Maybe it was a different night.
The night I remember we had gone to Omar's house.
We had drunk a bottle of rhum and lots of beers.
This was in Playas de Tijuana.
Why were we on Eusebio's car?
I couldn't stop talking.
Jessica and Catherine told me over and over to shut up, but I didn't.
What did I have to say that it was so important?
Now I struggle to complete 3 pages.
Maybe we were on the car to leave Jessica and Catherine, the girls,
at Jessica's house.
I slept with Eusebio.
Had I come out to them?
Probably not.
I hadn't even come out to myself then.
It doesn't matter.

Eusebio slept shirtless.
Never in my life have I slept shirtless.
That is until last night.
I went to bed in panties and my hoodie.

I read how the best times for street photography was when the sun rises and sets.
I thought about getting up very early in the morning.
I could buy a coffee in _Vieux Montréal_.
Around midnight I started hearing voices from outside.
Someone was having a party.
There were lots of people screaming and laughing.
I struggled to tell if they were talking in English or French.
I know, they spoke Spanish for a while.

I took off my hoodie and slept only in my underwear.
Because of that, I hesitated going to my window to look who was having a party.
I didn't sleep too well.
I didn't get up until noon.
I didn't know if I still wanted to go out.
I feel bloated still.
I looked at myself in the mirror after showering and putting on my clothes.
I have gained a lot of weight.
What's the point in trying to take a portrait of me,
if I look hideous in all of the photos?

Most of the videos and blogs about street photography mentioned how it was
so difficult to take pictures of people without them noticing.
I didn't think much of it until I actually started seeing them.
I remember how I even felt uncomfortable taking picture of myself.
Now, pointing my camera to other people was even worse.

I walked for more than 10 kilometers all of the afternoon and still I
only took a handful of _decent_ pictures.
They're not even worth editing for now.

After the night with Alda this Friday,
I thought I should not be spending any more money.
I still made a stop at Best Buy and bought an SD adapter.
I share my disney+ account with her.
I am the only one using it, anyway.
I sent her the password and username yesterday, but she was busy.
It was her birthday, after all.
9/11.
She saw it today.
She thanked me and then transferred me half of the money for the burgers.

I dreamt about her.
The dream was weird.
I don't remember much of the story, but it got sexual.
Not really explicit.
I don't think we did anything, but still.
I don't know how to explain it.
We talked about it. Was there some tension?
I don't remember anymore.
The only thing I remember is that when I woke up I thought about that time
when, living in Spain, Consuela came to my room to tell me something.
She was so nervous about it and I stupidly though she might wanted to
confess something.
She asked me to please do my part of the chores.
I wanted to die from the embarrasment.
Similiarly to when I received that message from Armando the other day about
the soiled toilet.

Just because her profile appeared to me twice in Tinder,
it doesn't mean she swiped right.

That's a stupid thought.
She lives with me.
She surely has figured out I am trans.
And more importantly, she's not my type.

Was today a failure?
I thought I would have gotten so many good pictures by the end,
yet most of them look subpar.
The composition is off, the exposure is not right all the time.
Some are even at very weird angles.
There are no subjects in them.
They are boring, not even mediocre.

They are just like me.

Was that money spent in vain?
Almost a thousand dollars, all for nothing.

I still need to take pictures of me.
That was the reason I bought it,
so I could take pictures of myself without them looking like selfies.
But, I am fat now.
I look ugly and disgusting.

Why would I want to record how I look, especially right now?

### Monday, September 13th, 2021
I have less than 15 minutes to finish the words.
I just went to the restroom and realized that I haven't done them.
This would be the third time this month that I miss them.
I have to go back every other word to fix typos.
I guess I am pretty drunk.

When did Eduardo replied to me?
It was today.
Yeah, it was today.
He apologized for getting back late to me and then replied every point one by one.
I saw the notifications for every message but decided to ignored them.
I couldn't look at them, at least not when they arrived.

10 minutes. One seventh of them.

Why was I so busy that I forgot?
I was editing the pictures.
I really thought that most of them were crap.
Some of them are actually quite good.
I could crop them, and adjust the lights.
Right now that I am writing this,
I worry that they are like those I had when I was in high school that I
made me think I was actually good at this.
They were over-saturated shit.
I remember some shots of some leaves that were so over-edited that the
green looked yellow.
I was actually proud of those.

I remember when I went to Ensenada.
No, it wasn't that time.
I was thinking first about the picture of the Alhameda.
One picture taken from too far away.

In spanish they say "unedited", does that really mean without post-production?
Or does it refer to images having never been published or submitted to any
contests before?

Catherine posted a picture about the fires in Valparaiso.
Honestly, even then I remember thinking that hers was so much better than mine.
Hers was more powerful.
There was something raw in them.
She, for sure, was gonna win.

None of us did, though.
I don't think I even knew who won.
Probably someone who submitted something about accomplishing their goals or
something cheesy like that.
I think the first place of another year was literally a person at the top of a
mountain with their arms up.

The time we went to Ensenada was before going for our semesters abroad,
so it wasn't that.
That time was when we met Abril.
It was this friend of my cousin Xennia.
She had her friend with her whom she met at Spain.
Was it Santiago de Compostela?
No, she went to A Coruña.

Less than 5 minutes and I'm barely halfway.
I am not gonna make it.

Catherine called me Abril for a few months after that.
She apologized because whenever she was meaning to refer to me the name of
Abril would come to her mind.
At first we laughed about it.
Then, when my own identity and gender issues started to resurface she
confessed that she already didn't see me as a man nor a woman at that point.
Maybe that was the reason the name of Abril kept coming to her head.

Less than 3 minutes.

It was probably bullshit.
She always fancied me, even when I looked like a man.
It's probably the cynic in me, but, after we broke up,
I always thought that she was just...

I can't complete that thought.
In less than two minutes the time is going to run out.
There's no point.

My fingers are numb.
I sent an email to Eduardo and Sarael asking to schedule a meeting.
I said that preferably it would not be tomorrow.
Only Eduardo replied back.
Hopefully it's later this week, because I haven't even started the slides.

Less than a minute.
I am not gonna finish.
Will this lock up and kick me out?

### Tuesday, September 14th, 2021
I am getting drunk again.
Am I a failure?

I edited around 30 pictures last night.
I thought I would have only a handful of good ones.

I couldn't sleep very well.
Maybe until around 3h or 4h.
I got up around 9h.

I received a message from Cassandra,
she was asking if there was an issue with my app.
After the generator reboot,
she had issues connecting to phebe and now she couldn't get into the app.
It made sense, after rebooting docker would have restarted as well,
so the services would be down.
It was a 3 minutes fix.
It would take me longer to turn on the PC and ssh to the BIC server than
to actually restart it.
I got up and got to it.

The same issue happened a month ago.
I sent an email to Ivan, the sysadmin, and he fixed it pretty quickly.
I brewed my coffee and just stayed up.

Did I work?
I think I did.
I did not make any progress into the slides for the networks project.
Sarael hasn't replied.
Tomorrow morning I'll send a message to Eduardo.
Hopefully he won't send a message asking if we're free in the next hours.
I want to go to bed right now.

I posted a picture on Instagram.
Actually, I posted three in the early morning, but deleted them shortly afterwards.
Later in the day I posted the one of the colorful building.
25 people have liked it.
Way more than I thought.
Yet, I feel shit about it.
I don't know why but I put Molly's name in the search box,
like a month ago after that party.
There was a red circle around her picture, but this time I didn't open it.
She posted some pictures of Paris.
I thought about Viviana.
She's in France, too, I guess.
She's pretty, why was I never interested in her?
Was it because of Said?
Maybe it's because she's straight.

I am watching the new series _Y the Last Man_.
I remember reading the comics.
Right now, I'm feeling pretty dysphoric about it.
If I were in that world, I'd have died with the men.
The rest of them.
The other men.

I'll finish the bottle tonight.
I really hope Sarael doesn't reply tomorrow.
I guess I could ignore the e-mail in case he did.

Alda sent me a message inviting me to go to a Jazz Fest this Thursday.
I said yes.
Of course I did.
I need to go out.
I want it to be Saturday so I can go out and take more pictures.
I don't care if they're still shit.
They probably will.

I muted Paty's profile, too.
I probably said something stupid.
Maybe it was the message about nude pictures in Whatsapp.
She has a girlfriend after all.
I was out of line, yet again so was she before that.
Who gives a shit?

I looked at the pictures I took of me from Saturday.
I do look bloated and fat.
Am I still like that?
Yeah, I was thinking about opening the apps again.
Even now, almost-drunk, I can tell it would be a horrible idea.
I just want someone, any human connection.

Next week I'll see the psychologist again.
Later that day, there's the PhD group.
Calli mentioned that, even if I sign-up, I am not obligated to go.
Chatting with Monica, I told her about my rock-bottom night.
I wanted to tell her that it was the night when I sent her and deleted those
messages, but held it in.
I lied and said that I've been feeling better.
No, I did feel better for a bit.
Not today, at least.

It was Apple's event.
The new iphones were announced.
I thought that I don't need them, nor the new MacBook.
Especially now that I've fixed this laptop.
Yet, I applied for a credit to buy the new iPhone.

When I came out to my mom, as I told Minas in our date, she was sad and cried.
More than disappointed, she felt bad that she couldn't had been there for me
while I was in pain.

I hate talking about those times.
Maybe that's why I felt so awkward with Alice.
She wanted to hear my life story.
I drink so I can get away from it myself.

The example my mom brought back that night was how I would be so excited
for new toys or stuff in Christmas.
Yet, just as the stuff came, she would notice how my smile would fade away
almost instantly, as if I realized that they didn't make any difference.

I keep spending money on frivolous shit and I'm still drinking myself to sleep.

### Saturday, September 18th, 2021
It's been several days that I've missed.
Do I really want to keep doing this?
I should, I signed up for another monthly challenge.
I remember years ago, when I looked into that November challenge about writing
a novel.
Was it the the National November... no, I don't know.

I looked at myself in different mirrors today and didn't feel as bloated,
fat or disgusting as in past days.
I think it was the night that I was going to go out with Alda,
I thought about wearing a skirt and, when I finally did,
I realized that it didn't really fit as it used to.
Even my jeans looked weird, the bigger ones that are in a larger size.

I think it was yesterday—maybe the day before—that I went to google photos and
I started to delete the bloat.
There were a lot of memes and screenshots of conversations.
When I was 15 I used to literally transcribe the msn messenger chat logs of
my conversations with Monica.
Now that I remember it, it seems ridiculous, maybe even a bit pathetic.
However, I also remember how I wrote the script for the short that Omar
presented to the High School short films competition.
He liked my work precisely because of the dialogue.
Maybe it was just practice.
A case study.

After finishing the 1l bottle of rhum,
I told myself that I would not buy more alcohol.
I am writing this drunk.
I drank two cans of cider,
and am currently drinking a glass of vodka with ginger ale.

Today wasn't a completely lost day.
I didn't go out to take pictures, but I cooked some meals for the lab.
I should go next week.
At least to change scenery.
I have the appointment in person with Calli this Tuesday.
It's at 9h.
I am a little anxious that I won't make it.

I bought a phone.
I don't need it, not really.
It's as if I am looking for some excitement in consummerism.
When I bought the camera, I was sure that it was the last thing that I needed.
After it arrived I would be able to take better pictures and maybe remake the
profiles in those damned datin apps—as if having better pictures would make
a fucking differance.
Months before, I thought the same thing about the noise cancelling headphones.
And before that there was the monitor.

I mean, I am using both of those right now.
Even the PC.

A couple of days ago, Alda invited me to go to this Jazz fest event.
It was a Thursday.
I picked up my hormones from the pharmacy after my meeting with Louis.
Coming home, I cooked some noodles for myself,
but realized halfway through that there wasn't enough time.
I shared some with Alda.
She really liked them,
so I sent her the youtube video explaining how to cook them.
I left the kitchen a mess.
Not really, just the sheet pan where I roasted the broccolis over the stove
and the wok with the food on top.
I didn't wipe the counters nor the stove.
Armando moved everything to the corner, uptop the dishwasher.
We both thought he was pissed.
We left the burgers we had just bought on the table and starting putting
things away.

The festival wasn't anything special.
Before leaving for the pharmacy,
Alda sent me a message telling me that we would meet there with Vix,
Karina—or is it Korina?—, and her friend.

I thought about Molly and felt stupid because of it.
_What did she have to do with anything?_

After the show, we moved to a bar.
This guy, out of nowhere just came and sat with us at the corner of the table.
I looked at him as if he were just a stranger.
To my right, Karina and her friend, Pablo, looked at him the same way.
Aiden? I think that was his name.
Apparently, he's this friend of Molly who's staying with her.
Somehow the conversation about tattoos came up and he mentioned how the one on
his ribs hurt the most.
He and some friends have the same one.
A pint of beer.

When Alda and I were walking home from the A&W with our burgers,
I confessed to her how, even though there's no real reason behind it,
I started to zoom out when Molly came up.
He invited us to do something this Saturday, and I would, of course,
not be going.

Vix was planning this BBQ tomorrow, Sunday.
I am not sure if I want to go.
Maybe I could just go out for another round of walking around and taking
pictures.
This time I could walk up to Jeanne-Mance and go for another round to
Mile End and Little Italy.

Would it be too weird to send Flore a message asking for that pizzeria she
recommended me?
Yes.
It totally would be.
I have deleted her contact now.

When I was deleting the pictures from Google photos,
I browsed throught the ones of Spain.
I took some where Helena is in the background.
Those where before I knew her, before what would happen.

Then there are the ones of our day wandering around in Braga.
Then the ones with Consuela.
Where was it that we went to the beach?
I remember seeing her writing on her notebook with her feet in the water.
I took some pictures of her jumping around, looking straight at the camera.
Were those with my phone or her camera?
I can differentiate her pictures from mine from the aspect ratio.
It doesn't really matter, I guess.

I seem to have lost the picture of both of us at the cathedral.
Was it really of us?

Am I still myself?

I have her profile in my searches log.
I could totally send her a message in Facebook, telling her just that,
that was looking at the pictures and remembering those days.
How's her life been going?
Except I really can't.
Or, it is not that easy, at least.

In the introduction, I would have to explain who I am.
At least tell her my deadname.
Invoke him.
Me.

The conversation with Zuri came to my head.
Twice.
The first one was when I was in a relationship with Monica.
She did exactly that.
She had just found the notebook I wrote to her.
I called her _mi princesa_ like a typical teenager boy who has never kissed a girl.
I wrote a bunch of cheesy stuff in there.
There was this scene that I could also make fun of,
except that it wasn't really funny.
I was really hurt.
It was her birhtday.
I had prepared that notebook for the past few days and wanted to give it to her.
She was hitting it up with Marco.
He had a thing for her.
I wasn't really competition.
Becuase, even though I didn't know it by then, I wasn't another boy.

She looked at me and laughed.
Then, she confessed how she was startled,

_"Por qué no trae aretes? ¡Oh, claro!, porque es niño. Él no es una niña."_

I didn't know it yet, but that remark wasn't just not funny, it made me incredibly uncomfortable.

I don't remember what I answered back that time.

The second was much more recent.
I might have been already living in Mexico City.

_"Disculpa, pero de dónde nos conocemos?"_

Did I add her or did she?
I told Monica how I consciously didn't send any friend requests to anyone who
knew me before my transition.
That's the reason why I don't have Garab, or Helena.
I can't really say that they don't have me in there because they don't accept
my transition, but... yeah.

I told her, vaguely, in a way that I didn't have to write up my deadname,
that I knew her from middle school,
but I looked way different and even had a different name.
Right.
She had suspected it, but wasn't sure.

Lots of people told me just that.
I think it was Diana who said that she saw my profile with a picture
from me dressed up outside René's office.

"I didn't know if it was you or just some girl with a similar name.
Maybe a cousin or something.
I just thought she looked so much like you"

That was the joke that Garab used.

"Did he change sex?".

He wanted to be funny.
Catherine had to explain to him, that, well, kind of.

Helena is from Estonia.
I don't know how the situation is over there.
Consuela told us how even in Romania her own parents make faces when
there's a parade or something.

It's not worth it.
I should not just send random messages to people I am not in contact with.

Just like this afternoon when I sent the screenshot to Monica,
where Instagram suggested me to follow Minas.

"I am not doing that shit again", I said.

"Good!"

### Sunday, September 19th, 2021
I feel the same repulsion towards doing the words as I do with
the rTMS project that is still left undone.

Last Monday I sent an e-mail to both Eduardo and Sarael asking them for a
meeting to share the—still unmade—slides of the results.
Sarael never answered back.
Probably he never saw the mail, but I still worry he might have just ignored it.

I ate way too much in the early afternoon.
The big white bowl of Alda filled with rice, vegetables, sausages and two eggs.
Armando, again, did his meal-preps filling the freezer to the max.
He has been moving my pink towel to the very edge of the rack.
Does he really puts his towel in there,
or is it a passive-aggresive gesture like moving my stuff from the kitchen?
He sent us a message about eating his potatoes.
I still haven't seen it.

There are messages from Monica and Sonny, too, that I left unreplied.
I might have not even answered back to the message of my mum asking me how
I've been doing.

After eating, I watched a couple of episodes of Breaking bad.
After the first one, I went back to my bed.
I didn't finish two episodes before shutting the ipad off and just
going back to sleep.

I thought I wouldn't eat another meal again until tomorrow.
I saw this random video about the effects of over-eating.
I am not sure that it is not something that I ocassionally do,
like binge drinking.
Calli specifically asked me if my eating habits were disturbed with my mood.
I guess they are.

The bottle of vodka is just a little over half.
I was pretty drunk last night.
I went out to cry, like that last time.
Did I cry?
I remember sitting on my spot and wondering about going to the Jeanne-Mance.
I decided against it and came back home.
Not much later, Alda sent me a message inviting me to share a joint.
We went to the dog park and sat on a bench in front of the children's playground.
I got that same familiar sensation of my body drifting away from me.

The jobs crashed again.
Even deleting most of the filenames was not enough.
I will need to browse the code in GitHub about that issue.

I should get working with the slides.
The idea that maybe splitting the task in smaller,
easier achievable goals would make everything more managable, but I'm not sure.
I feel overwhelmed and I haven't even started.
After I saw that message where Eduardo asked me for an update,
I told him I would make the slides in the weekend.
This is the second weekend after that, and I haven't started.

Would it be too rushed if I asked Louis about a week—or at least some days—off?
I don't know if I could wait until Thursday for our meeting.
Maybe a quick e-mail tomorrow, before or after the Neuro meeting,
asking for the procedure of just, you know, taking off the days he offered.

I guess I should send another e-mail to them.
Maybe a message to Eduardo in Slack.
He'll probably send it himself.
I fear that he'll ask me to just meet the two of us that afternoon.
I should finish the slides in case that happens.
Or I could keep ignoring the issues and keep worried and anxious,
like I usually do.

I thought about going to the lab tomorrow, but I won't.
There's no point.
I'll go Tuesday after the meeting with Calli.
I also need to send the e-mail to Vlad asking him about his tool that does a
similar thing to SNIPE.
And another one about the segmentation with deep-learning.

It's 20h.
I feel as if it were midnight.
I feel tired, even though I slept all morning and some of the afternoon.
I wanna go to bed again.
I want to close my eyes and disappear, at least for a while.
I want to stop existing.
Does this count as thoughts of self-harm?
I haven't really considered anything again with the razors.
I think about it, sure, but not really considered it.

I probably won't work with the slides, will I?

I sent a message to Monica asking her directly about the flights.
She called me _Sofi_ and then said that they're too expensive.

I was at the stairs when I sent a message to Johanna in Facebook.
It was as pathetic as it could be.
That's what happens after thinking too much about those days and people.

Holiday or not, I should try to be as productive as possible for now.
Even if I don't work tonight, I'll set up the tasks for tomorrow.

### Monday, September 20th, 2021
I'll have to get up early tomorrow and shower in the morning
in order to leave the apartment before 8h30.
Maybe if I get up early enough, I can have my coffee here in the balcony.
Maybe if I get up really early, I can take my camera for the golden hour.
I won't.

I sent an e-mail to Louis asking about the time off.
He was really encouraging.
I had so much luck with him.
He's just the PI that I need right now.
Or, maybe if he were the usual hard-ass that exploits his students and
is on top of them, I wouldn't have the time to be depressed.
I worked better at the NIH where I had 9-5 days five days a week.
I did end up having a mental breakdown the last day, though.
Perhaps that's how things would have really ended;
me dropping out, feeling like a total failure.

Am I not a total failure right now?

I thought I would not drink anymore in the next couple of days.
I am already finishing my drink and considering serving me another one.

I will. I am.

I did.

What will I talk about tomorrow?
I could talk more about that dating spree I had.
Maybe I could start talking about how I feel like I am in this different
kind of closet.
I could start with how I, just recently after living months with them,
told Armando and Alda that I was gay.
Just hours before I met the first very openly lesbian woman in Montréal.
I asked her out awkwardly and nothing came from it.
Then, to distract myself from the rejection, I went out with another girl.
I thought things were going fine and ended up being ghosted.
I kept going out with other girls, with always the same conclusion.
No, I could tell how the next girl after Flore was Alice,
this pretty trans girl with whom things went so fast that I felt disoriented.
I could talk a bit more in depth about how I felt after arriving at her place.
How I felt uncomfortable and uneasy.
It wasn't because she's trans.
It was because she's trans *like* me.
Maybe Molly and Flore,
and all the other girls with whom things would not work out in the following weeks,
rejected me because they felt just like I felt at that moment,
sitting at that dinner table and listening to her voice and seeing her smile.

I feel like crying, but I don't know why.
I drink because it helps me numb the emotions.
I drink because it helps me let out the feelings that I have drowned.

I want to stop drinking.
I fear for the moment the bottle of vodka I bought just this weekend is going
to run out.
Will I buy another one?
I shouldn't, but I'm pretty sure that I will.

Am I a functional alcoholic?
Am I functioning enough?

I'll wait until after the session tomorrow to decide if I'll ask for the time
off just this week, or if I can wait until the next one.
Two weeks ago, I had a breakdown.
I drank myself to a stupor and walked around the city,
crying in the middle of the night.
I feel like going out just now.
I probably won't, but I might.

I look at myself in the mirror and every day I feel different.
Last night I deleted another 2k photos from Google Photos.
Johanna never replied back to my pathetic message in Facebook.
Maybe I should check to see if she deleted me.
I would have.

The tears are coming, but they feel stuck.
My eyes just feel watery and my throat closed, but there's no release after.
It's like that feeling the moment just before you sneeze, but it's stuck.

I am not functioning.
This is not working.
This journal is not working.
Going out to take pictures didn't work.
Swimming in the pool didn't work.
Running in Mont-Royal didn't work.
Making an appointment with a counselor didn't work.
Spending thousands of dollars in frivolous shit didn't work.
Drinking myself to sleep doesn't work.
I am not functional, right now I am just an alcoholic.

Danilo stopped following on Twitter.
Maybe it's because he doesn't want to follow one of his students?
Perhaps it's just that he found out that I am not that important.
Probably, it's because of the shit I post.
I am not worth to follow.
I have nothing important to share.

I have nothing important to say.

I am not important.

### Tuesday, September 21th, 2021
I stayed up all night reading these journal entries.
I went from... where did I start?
It was before I told my mum, before Catherine told hers; before graduation.
Ours, but after Eusebio and the group's.

It doesn't really matter.
I went to serve myself a drink, just to calm the nerves.
Reading through I made myself another one.
As I told Calli today,
the first one calms me down and soothes the emotions that I have bottled up.
The second one lets them all come out nice and easy.
I started crying, listening to music and crying.
I don't even remember what was it that I was reading.

I got to one of Zayra's exercises.
I read Melissa's name and felt this urge to share it.
I was pretty drunk already.
I started translating it into spanish in a Google Doc.
It was around 3h when I wrote the message to Melissa.
I mentioned how I got into her name and thought about her.
I told a bit about the story of Helena,
how I saw her writing in her journal in the sea that time.
Even after all these years—like the years that've passed since that Zayra's
class—I still wonder if she wrote about me in there.
I would like to know. So maybe she'd like to know as well.

I shared the link and closed the chat window.
I kept reading.
I realized that if I went to sleep,
there would be a pretty significant chance that I wouldn't be able to get up
in the morning.
I've already spend so much more money than I should this month,
a no-show fee would be stupid.

My mum sent me a message.
I think it was yesterday.
How the work on my grandma's house is on standby.
Apparently Edgar and his wife have run out of money.
I mentioned how he was pretty shitty with money, then.
I said it, the one who've spent so much in such useless shit recently.

When I checked the bank app today,
I noticed that I've gone over-balance in the credit card.
I posted a payment, but all of the charges went up first instead.
I won't spend any more money until the end of the month.
It should be easy.
I have the 9 burritos in the freezer.
10 eggs.
Sausages and a lot chicken thighs.
Enough pasta for a couple of days and 2 kilos of rice.

I don't want to fill the finances portion this month.
I spent more than a thousand dollars on the camera.
I spent several hundreds on stuff for the house and the bathing suit
that I've worn only once.
It's like the belt that I bought because I was sure I would start running.
Which, also, I did only a couple of times.

Maybe I should try it again.
I also never went again to the pool.
The lists confused me.
They removed the ones for the pool leaving only the ones for the gym.
Even those have the times scribbled over.
It's a mess.

I am a mess.

I should try not to spend too much on shit in October either.
I still haven't paid Fall's tuition.
Only a thousand dollars.
There are still two left.
Friday I'll need to pick up the phone.
Even for that, I need to buy the charger, an adapter for my headphones,
and I wanted the wallet.
The wallet is a luxury that I don't really need.
The charger, too, is something that I might not need, at least not for now.
I guess I could make that argument for the headphones adapter.
Fuck it, even for the phone itself.

I showered before the sunrise.
I left the apartment after Armando.
I felt weird getting into the building.
The session was better than on zoom,
but still I noticed that I kept to myself some of the stuff that I wanted to
talk about.

I feel isolated because I feel I am in the closet again.
I feel like I can't open myself up to my roommates because I don't want to
ruin the fantasy of them not knowing I am trans.
I feel like I don't belong with Alda's friends.
I feel that I was, and will be, rejected in dating because I am trans.
Everything comes back to it and I hate it.

She left me some assignments, but I've forgotten about most of them already.

In the early morning I exchanged some messages with Melissa.
She did reply.
She's still depressed, just like me.
Just like back then.

Around noon, I saw another notification in my phone.
Johanna had replied to my message in Facebook.
I hid the notification even though I smiled and was excited about it.
Isn't this what I wanted?
Why am I ignoring her now?

I can reply to her in the morning.
I accidentally opened the chat in the ipad so the message it's already seen
anyway.

I feel a bit sick.
This happened after returning from the building.
It's not like I lied when they screened me.
My stomach hurts a bit and I feel warm.
It's probably the lack of sleep.

I shouldn't even try to work anymore.
I'll just lie down and go to sleep.
Maybe I can get up early and get to work.
I *still* haven't finished the slides.
The day after tomorrow, in the morning, is the meeting with Eduardo.
I have to do something to show to Louis during our meeting.
Then I can take a week off.

### Wednesday, September 22nd, 2021
I don't feel like doing the words; even less about doing the slides.
I finished with the summary tables and the data, at least.
I have not formatted them for the slides.
I could, actually...

What was I writing?
Oh, right;
I could use only those tables as the slides and leave it like that,
but that's not correct.
These are just the results that I presented months ago.
I promised I had run the nodal analysis.
That was a lie.
I still need to run the code.
A little less than an hour ago R wasn't opening.
I don't know what would I had done, if I had not resolved it.

I woke up today pretty tired around noon.
I haven't drunk.
My mum asked me how the appointment with the Dr went.
It went fine.
It did, right?
Yeah, last night I didn't cry nor went out.
I wanted to, I almost did, but in the end did not.

Did I drink yesterday?
I don't really remember.
I don't remember most of last night.
I know I slept in the afternoon, around 3 or 4 hours.
After that, it's all blurry.
I read.
That I know.

I was reading that the tracking number on the lenses means that it won't be
tracked once it arrives in Canada.
That's why the last update was posted a week ago.
It could arrive at any moment now.
Hopefully, it will come before the weekend.

I replied to Johanna.
She has seen the message, but hasn't written back.
In the journal, I read how she was one of the first people I told, actually.
The last days I read were around the first months of hormones.
I read about Anahi, Paola, Catherine, Eusebio and Jessica.
I should had broken up with Catherine.
Anahi and Paola were good friends since the very beginning.
Eusebio was trying, at least.
Jessica...
why did I keep talking to them?

I have this memory of us sitting in the second floor of Argana.
There is Eusebio, I think?
I just know that Jessica is by my side.
I was talking to them, I needed to talk to them.
Maybe one of my futile tries of _reaching out_ to people.
In my memory, Jessica is sitting by my side.
I hug her and lay my head on her shoulder.
I am way too touchy, but it doesn't feel creepy.
Well, I mean, I know it doesn't mean much coming from me,
but at least I review the memory without cringing.
It is actually kind of sweet.
I miss that kind of touch.
When I was living as a boy it felt off.
Now that I am woman,
because I am trans it still feels weird to be that affectionate.
I have this worry that I will come off as predatory.

In the afternoon I ate two flour tortillas with eggs, bologna,
spinachs and vegetables.
I feel hungry now, but I don't want to eat.
One of the assignments from Calli,
was to be aware when I restrict food as a form of punishment,
and try to be more forgiving with myself.
Is it what I am doing right now?
It has to do with the money.
I wanted to not spend anything until after receiving my next month's salary.
Two weeks.
I should be able to.
Probably.

I really want some pizza and fries.
Two weeks.

This is the longest I've taken to complete the words since I started again this year.
I really am having trouble concentrating.
I should ask Louis for a time off.
Next week, just one week.

I hope... what do I hope?

I saw some stories in Instagram from Eusebio and Jessica.
They are in the talks of the church for their wedding.
We were in Rosarito, one of the conferences we went to.
The only one, I think.
One of the people we met there told us about how it's always a bad idea dating
someone from the same undergrad.
No, from the same group of friends.
When you break up, it makes this huge mess with the rest of the group.
Eusebio and Jessica have broken up a couple of times, I think.
No, just once.
It didn't last long.
No, it did.
It took a while before they got back together, officially, at least.

I guess that did happen with Catherine and me.
No, I was never really an important part of that group.
I also am living in a different country.
Yeah, sure; that's why I wasn't invited to the wedding.

### Thursday, September 23rd, 2021
It hurts a little reading about those days.
It's not fun anymore.
It's not just the cringe of the awkward situations, the immaturity,
and the co-dependency.
It's also the pictures I browsed a couple of nights ago,
the pictures of that stage of my life, the first months on hormones.

I passed a couple of times to some strangers.
I really can't see why.
I looked hideous.
I remember how the first two years I'd go back to those same pictures and
feel proud of my smiles.
_I look so happy_ I would tell myself,
parroting the same stupid discourse of online circles.
It's all bullshit, of course.
Now, I feel uncomfortable looking at those smiles.
I feel so foolish.

Even now, half a decade later,
I still can't separate being attractive with being seen as a woman.

It doesn't really matter, I guess.

I could not get out of bed in the morning.
I decided against it, even though I had the meeting with Eduardo and Sarael.
I just didn't shower.
I haven't showered.
I probably won't today.

The meeting went fine.
I didn't finish the slides.
I mean, I did, but not really.
I presented in there only the most important results from last time again.
The new nodal results I left in the reports.
It was foolish to make them, of course nothing would come up.
There are some interesting results, though.
Even consistent.
I could, again, try to do the sub-networks analyses.

I... what was I going to write?

Right, the lab meetings.

After the meeting in spanish and feeling all hyped-up like I usually do,
I made myself a sandwich.
Time passed and I tried to think about what I could do until Mallar's lab meeting.
It had to do with deep learning, so it would look bad if I didn't attend.
I got in with my camera turned off.
After a while, not much, Andjela asked if she could start.
Mallar said that they should wait a little longer.
He saw some _creeps_ from Louis' lab.
That word made me feel uneasy, even though it wasn't hostile.
He asked if Louis was going to come personally.
He asked me directly by name.

That was the only time that I unmuted myself.

The meeting ended right before my meeting with Louis, 10 minutes early.
He sent me a message on teams saying that he was ready,
if I wanted to start earlier.
We didn't have much to talk about.
I told him how Niagara was down and Maget was still not working,
even though I shortened the links.
If he was disappointed in me, he hid it very well.
After I made up some things that I had worked on the week,
we ran out of things to talk about,
so he brought up that I had sent him an email asking for time off.

I confirmed and asked for next week.
He suggested me this place where people go to whale watch.
He also mentioned that I could ask some other students where to go on a
graduate student's budget.

Either yesterday or a couple of days ago,
I noticed that Danilo doesn't follow me on Twitter anymore.
I mean, I don't judge him really.
I don't really post anything, and when I do, it's stupid things.
It still hurt.

Reading about those first months of hormones I got to the part of when Garab
asked Catherine about me.
Weeks later, I would send friend requests to the people in the know.
Garab was one of those.
He accepted, I narrated.
He's not in my Facebook now, though.

It also hurts reading how I was.
So self-centered and immature.
No wonder Monica was so angry with me.
Yeah, she was kinda shitty, but who wouldn't be in her place?

"Do you still doubt that you hurt me?", she said.

And even years later, fuck, even when we started talking again I
would have not realized fully what was it that I did.

She didn't see me first after coming back from France.
That was what started everything.
I would send her cryptic messages and feel bad because she wouldn't read my mind.
I deleted her first because she didn't give me enough attention.

It doesn't matter.
I should stop fixating on those days.

I went outside three times to check if the package had arrived.
Online people said that it took 5 weeks for their package to arrive from Ukraine.
I feel so desperate.

I don't know if I'll go somewhere next week.
At first I wondered about going to some cute little town in Quebec and take
lots of pictures with my camera.
I do worry about my French.
I remember the other mexican student telling me that the further I'd go away
from Quebec or Montreal, the fewer people spoke English.

I guess the safest choice would be to look for some hostal and just go
two days to Quebec city.
I might end up doing that, I guess.

### Friday, September 24th, 2021
All week I was waiting for this day to come,
the day that I would come and pick up the new phone.
I was so excited.
Here it is, and sure, it is prettier than the older one.
It's smaller and cuter, I like the size better.
It's gonna fit better in my pockets, the camera's supposed to be better.

There were lines outside the apple store.

No, I should start even before that.

I could not get up in the morning.
The appointment for the phone was at 13h.
I didn't put an alarm.
I thought it was absurd setting up an alarm for an appointment in the afternoon.
I did set it, though.
When I woke up in the morning, I wanted to sleep more.
I set up an alarm for 11h so I would have time to get in the shower and get
ready and then returned to bury my face in the pillow.

The alarm did not make any sound when it should.
I stayed in bed even after I should had gone up.
I was dreaming something, but I can't really recall what it was about.

It's the weekend now.
Friday's afternoon.
Not only it's going to be the weekend, but I have a week off.
I should look into the trip.
I have travelled alone before.
I went to Europe, Spain, all by myself.
I travelled to Washington to live on my own.
I came here to Canada.
Why does the idea of taking a couple days off seems so tiring?

I am drinking.
I promised myself I wouldn't, and yet here I am.
I bought a bag of chips, a liter of milk, two cans of cider and another
two of soda—for the vodka that is left.

I thought I could only eat the chips and maybe have a small drink.
The bottle of vodka is almost done.
I drank the soda I already had and one of the cans.
I am finishing one of the two cans of cider.

I want the other one even though I am already quite drunk.
I feel good, though.
Or is it _well_?

I know the fantasy is really stupid, but when I get drunk and high I think
about my body slipping through time.
Now that I am a little tipsy, I keep going back to different times in my past.
Different moments in Tijuana.
Different people.
It might be because I've been reading the journal of 5 years ago.

I feel better than ever.
Then I realize it's mostly because of the alcohol, and that brings me down.

I showered, got ready, and went just in time to the apple store.
I check my old phone and saw that it was precisely 13h02 when I saw the lines
outside the entrance to the store.

I fe...

It's hard focusing.
What was it that I was writing about?

It probably had to do somehting with the French I heard over there.
Oh, right, I feel guilty whenever I hear a _Bonsoir_ or _Bonjour_ and I reply back
in English.
Even though it's not my first language either,
I feel like a lazy entitled american.
I am trying.
I am doing my best.

A week ago—maybe more, maybe less—I thought about posting some cryptic stupid
tweet like that, how I am doing my best, and yet it doesn't feel like enough.
Gladly I decided against it.
That's the kind of shit that makes people unfollow me.

I just grabbed the second cider.
I liked the pear one better.

After setting up the iphone, I got 3 months of apple TV.
I'm finally watching Ted Lasso.
I've heard of the critics' reaction to it,
and then they talked about it on the Scrubs podcast.
It's another shot from Bill something.
It's sweet.
The protagonist is so sweet and charming.
There are a lot of hugs and I feel so lonely.

Tomorrow I'll look about setting up the trip.
At least Quebec City.
Maybe another small town nearby, probably not.

I received... what did I receive?

I got a phone call on my new phone.
Actually the first call.
It was a recorded message telling me something about an express, something else.
Was it a package?
It probably was about the package from Ukraine, the lenses.
The message told me to press double zero to inquire about it and then turned to chinese.
I went outside to check but there was nothing new.

4 words until I finish. I'll leave it there.

### Saturday, September 25th, 2021
Seven days streak.
I don't think I look at that number since I've started doing these words again.
It's going to be two months by the end of next week.
This is the moment where I would get to think about what has happened since then,
but I don't really feel like it.

I told myself I would not buy more alcohol and be careful with my expenses this month.
And here I am, I bought cider a couple of days ago,
I've finished the bottle of vodka,
and I'm looking at the tours in Quebec city and _l'île d'orleans_.
It's going to be around 100 dollars for the train tickets and a little bit
less for the hostel.
I bought a smaller backpack in Amazon.
Even if I don't go to the trip—which I should, or explaining to Louis that
I didn't do shit in my time off would be very embarrasing—,
the bag should be useful for my photography walks.

My father sent me a message today asking how things are going.
I tried sending a message to my mum to check if iMessage works.
No, it was before that.
I told her that I'd bought a new phone and gave her my number—the same one
that I've had since the beginning of this year.

My father asked me if I had changed numbers,
given that my mum shared that one with him.

I just got a message from Armando in messenger.
I decided to ignore them.
We haven't really talked since that night out to the Jazz Fest with Alda.
I left in a hurry and didn't clean the kitchen.
When we came back, we returned to it clean and all the stuff moved to the side.
I sent him a message apologizing,
and he was a bit passive-aggresive and a bit of an asshole.

I was going to write something about how I wonder if I was still upset about that,
but after the last sentence, I guess I am.
I'm not sure he really likes us, to be honest.
It doesn't matter, I guess.
He's leaving in two months.

I could write about my wondering about the trip.
The days.
The prices of the train go up by the end of the week.
I could extend the trip from Wednesday to Saturday, but, of course,
that'd mean paying an extra night at the hostel and more in food.

I saw about these different tours.
They would make things easier.
Instead of exploring, I could just show up somewhere on time and just be there.
Exploring on my own feels harder, lonelier.

There was this tour that included...
I don't really want to talk about it.
Tomorrow I'll buy the tickets and plan everything.

This morning I could not get out of bed.
I didn't even try.
I left the windows open and just covered my face with the other pillow.
I know I was dreaming something, but I can't recall the smallest detail of them.

Three months and the year is over.
One fourth.
I am on a holiday and yet I feel the most motivated to start working.
I hope it doesn't disappear as soon as I get back to the office on Monday.

Alda did mention that she started smoking inside her room,
to the side of the window.
A couple of days ago—maybe even just this morning—I glanced outside the window
from the living room and saw a bic lighter outside her window frame.
Do I feel anything about it?
I don't think I do.

Louis recommended going whale watching.
I did look at some tours, but decided against it.
I don't know what I want to do.
I thought about just walking around the city, taking pictures, maybe.
I saw these bike tours on the island.
I am considering one of those.
They're a bit expensive, but... am I really worth it?

Monica won't come.
When I was doing research for the bus and rail tickets,
I found that the train to NYC is less than 100 canadian dollars.
I told Monica that maybe, when the borders do open, we could go meet there.
She liked the idea.
I was excited.
I excitedly mentioned going for New Year's.
She said the idea was stupid.

Still, in our short and impersonal conversation,
my dad mentioned that they might ask for a vaccine passport when they finally
open the border in November.
Will they open the border?

If they don't, I have an excuse to not go home.
Do I really not want to go home?
I don't want to stay here, either.

Where do I belong?

### Sunday, September 26th, 2021
I feel like crying.
I told Sonny how I really want a drink right now.
I finished the bottle of vodka yesterday.
I didn't get drunk, but I liked it so, so much.

I should not buy more.
Just keeping away from the alcohol would save me so much money.

I am getting more and more anxious about the money.
I guess I could always cancel the internet and use the one from the building.
I need to buy food.
Maybe not having food would be better for me.
Well, not better, but it'd be helpful in me losing more weight.
I fool myself pretty easilty with the way I look.
In the mirror I think I look alright, but then I look at myself in
pictures and realize that I was wrong.
It's not only about the weight, my face looks weird, too.
The skin colour, the weird patches, the black spots of hair.

I hate how I look almost as much as I hate myself.

I also told Sonny how I've changed my mind more than a handful of times since
yesterday about going to Quebec.
It would be good having a time on my own outside the house.
I could take some pictures, make use of the camera.
Just pretend I have a life.

It's also going to cost me more than 200 CAD.
Money that I should not spend.
I can always tell Louis that there are some things that are still closed,
and I started getting anxious with the prices and all,
that I just decided to take a rest.
I'm sure he will understand.

Right now, again, I am favoring more the idea of not going.
The last plans, a couple of hours ago, were to go out Wednesday in the very
early morning, staying in the city; wandering around, have a lunch,
taking some pictures until the afternoon, and grabbing a beer at some pub.
The next day I'd ask to put my bag in the storage that the hostel offers and
take the tour.
The original plan was to take the tour as soon as I got to the city,
but the anxiety of not making it would be too much.

As I said, right now I don't feel like it.
I don't want to get up at 4h to shower and shave and apply make up to catch
the train.
I don't want to deal with figuring out how to shave in the shared bathrooms
with the long line of sinks and mirrors out in the open.
I really don't want to wander around feeling alone.
I am not feeling it right now.
Maybe it's better just to rest.
Save the money.

I am tired right now, even though, once again,
I did not get out of bed until after noon.

I need to buy food.
I cooked the sausage that I left yesterday with some spinach.
I ate it with some rice and fried eggs.
I have another bowl of cooked rice in the fridge and almost two kilos
of uncooked rice in the counter.
I have a lot of chicken in the freezer.
9 burritos, too.

I have two cans of tomatoes for making pasta.
I crave pizza so bad.
I want the fries, mostly.

I want to say fuck it, buy myself a 4-pack of guinness beers and
order a pizza with fries and finish all of them in one night.
I would feel so full and empty inside at the same time.

I would surely feel like a piece of shit that night and the next morning.

I don't know what else to write about.

Calli suggested videogames as a way to rest and take my mind out of,
out out of what?
I did try it.
I restarted the PC and logged into Windows.
I remembered there were some instructions for setting up the headphones
in dual-boot setups.
In Windows, I downloaded the last updates to the Assassin's Creed game.
I played maybe 10 or 15 minutes, and I got sick of it.
It wasn't fun.
It didn't take my mind out of anything.
I kept thinking about the trip.
I kept trying to ignore the faint urges to cry.

I came back to the Linux partition and followed the rest of the instructions
for the bluetooth headset.

I opened the 750words website and instead of opening today's white page,
I went to the first one in August.
I read a couple of paragraphs where I talk about _the date_ with Molly and
felt a little sick.

### Monday, September 27th, 2021
I decided against the trip.
This time it's really final.
Last night I stayed up until well past midnight, worrying about the money.
I need to put aside 500 CAD minimum each month to have just enough money to
pay for tuition.
I can't keep going all _laissez-faire_ with my money.

This morning I finally set up mint and linked my canadian bank account
and the amount of spent money made me sure of my decision.
More than 3 thousand dollars during this month which is not even over yet.

Then I remembered that I paid one thousand dollars for the tuition.
later I recieved the backpack and started doubting it again.

I sent a message to Monica, asking her how she's doing.
It'd been several days since I last heard of her.
A couple of minutes later she repied back.
Honestly, she's not that well.
She feels a heaviness all around her, and every action is extremely tiring.
I told her it was text-book depression.

We talked a little bit more about it.
She commented how she's going to make an appointment with the psychologist.
She told her mom about it, but she was very dismissal to the idea.
She keeps thinking about the last two people she saw that were completely awful.

I just made myself a cup of tea,
to see if it can aliviate a little the urge to drink alcohol.
I've finished the chai black tea that I had,
so I grabbed a bag of herbal hibiscus tea.
Foolishly, I put on a splash of milk.
That shit turned purple.

I signed my name in the sheet of the gym downstairs.
10h.
Maybe doing some exercise will be good for my mental health.
Should I do some research into how to actually use the machines?
I could always just go to the treadmill, I guess.
But if I want to jog, why not go to Mont-Royal?

Maybe later this week I can actually go to Mont-Royal again.
Walk up to the observatory and take some pictures from there.
I read about the _Marché Jean-Talon_ in Little Italy.
I could walk there again like my walk that other time.
I don't think I'd feel comfortable taking pictures inside the market,
but I remember several peculiar views the last time I went that way.
I could eat there or buy some produce.
Then again, I had to goal of not spending anything else until the end of the month.
What's the point of that, if I already owe more than a hundred dollars on the credit card?
Sometimes I can be pretty irrational.

This is my first day of my week off.
I am worrying again about what I will eat.
What food I need to buy.
Three more days until the end of the month.
One week until I receive the payment of my stipend.
I have the bowl of cooked rice, some flour tortillas, one egg,
the dozen of sausages, bologna, two slices of bread, one packet of ramen,
a lot of chicken thighs, the burritos and some dry pasta.
I can make it easily, I guess.

I don't know what else to write about.
How am I feeling?
I am getting distracted pretty easily.
I filled the second day of the mood recording app.
I put in a good mood, but is it really?
Right now I don't feel as if I were OK, I feel like something is bottled up.

I feel hungry, but I don't want to eat anything.
The reflection in the mirror on my bureau looked thin again.
Well, thinner.
Was it last night?
I kept browsing the old pictures,
just as I've been reading the old journal entries.
It was after six months of hormones that I started looking decent.

Do I mean passable?
Or is it being attractive what I am referring to?

I don't really love how I looked before I moved to Mexico City,
but at least those pictures of just a couple of months before don't make me cringe.
The pictures I really like are those from the time before my departure to the US.
Ironically, those are from the worst period of my life,
starting from when Catherine and I broke up.
That's when I started to lose weight.
When I looked my best was when I felt the worse, around the trip to Vegas.

The pictures I like most are right next to the pictures of my bleeding thighs.

### Tuesday, September 28th, 2021
I usually get infected with the sadness and depression I was feeling when
writing the journal entries that I've read.
I finally finished all the way from before my transition to my move to
Mexico City.
I don't feel down, but I feel extremely anxious.

The last entries talked about my looking for a place in the new city.
I was worried about the mismatched official documents and burdened with
social anxiety.
I had a lot of stuff to deal with from the simultaneous applications to the
master programs while at the same time trying to figure out how to navigate
the bureocratic maze that was changing my birth certificate.

There's also the stuff that I didn't even write about but still was brought back.
The living situation in that first apartment sucked.
The bathrooms were horrible, the building was cheaply made,
and there were a lot of people.

I made a jump to a couple of months later when I fainted in the shower.
Then, after just two days of that summer, I made another big leap to almost
a year and a half later.
I wrote about a situation with Maleny and the cleaning.

Now that I think of it, have I ever had a comfortable living situation?
The first building was horrible.
I moved to that other building with—what was her name?—and her boyfriend and
her friend.
The girl that would later kick me and Karen out.
After that, I moved with Maleny.
I liked that building and apartment more than the other two.
Still, mostly now that I think back to it,
there were always issues with my roommate.
Was I ever a slob?

When I was living with Raul and Consuela,
she came to my room to ask me to do my part of the cleaning.
With Rosa and her third-world student residency,
I wasn't just living with a bunch of undergrads, most of them were freshmen.
Being the most clean person in that place doesn't really count.
A similar thing happened with the physicists.
The literature guy was the dirtiest one of us.
He made me look good by comparison.

Maleny wasn't as anal as Armando, but still.
I can remember her phonecall—phonecalls? were there more than one?—with her friend,
passive-aggresively saying that the apartment was disgusting.
I don't know why I remember it as if I had heard her friend asking her
why she doesn't say something.
It's impossible given that it was phonecall.
Maybe it was something I inferred from her reply?
She said something like that,
in anycase she's very special and nobody can clean like she wants to.

I lived there for less than I've lived here in Montréal.

I don't remember from the top of my head how long I lived with the physicists.
I know I moved there around the time that I first broke up with Catherine.
It was around the summer.
No, that can't be, can it?
I moved to the shitty first building in february.
I moved fairly quickly back to Tijuana after the applications.
The first semester I walked to classes from the apartment nearby.
Wait...
the first earthquake was in september 2017.
I had broken up with Catherine by then.
I remember going out from the metro after the earthquake,
coming home from the Condesa clinic and taking the bus back to that building.
Nonetheless, I also remember that when I talked to Catherine again after we
had just broken up, I told her I was already living at the other place.

When did I move then?
Was it really during the first semester?
I guess I could just check the pictures.
Even without checking, if that is true and I moved there halfway through the
first semester, knowing that we were kicked out in the summer,
that still is not much more than how far I've lived here, either.
Probably around the same.

Does this mean that here is the place—other than my parent's house—where I've
lived the longest?

After Fuentes Brotantes, I had been jumping around between airbnbs.
Those two places before finally going the DC were my favorites.
The condo doesn't need much explanation,
but the one that followed was a good location, too.
It was relatively close to the lab, it felt homely, and there was something
with the television in the room that I really liked.
Then the two one-month places in the US.
The house in Iztapalapa.
The semester in Queretaro where I lived with Dey and with the Dr.
And, finally, the year in quarantine back in Tijuana.

The anxiety I described to Sonny just moments ago,
like the sensation of looking for your wallet, passport and keys before
going late to the airport, is finally starting to subsede.
It's still there.
I feel like I'm missing something important.
A big deadline is approaching that I completely forgot about.
I have the pending analysis with Eduardo and Sarael's project.
I already enrolled to the candidacy exam.
I am on my week off from the analysis at the lab.
The passport and study permit won't expire until 2023.
What is it?

I drank a cup of tea,
but it was only one bag and it is supposed to be caffeine-free.

I don't know what, but I am sure I am missing something.

### Wednesday, September 29th, 2021
I am starting to get cold.
I guess it's finally that time of the year again.
Just this morning I...

I got distracted.
Should I put on a hoodie?
The final episode of Breaking bad is over.
I considered continuing with the movie, but it wasn't...

I got distracted again.
A customer rep from student universe contacted me about the failed reservation
of the flight.
I could try again now.
I did but got the same result.

I planned getting up earlier to start getting accustomed to a productive schedule.
Last night I caught up to the most recent entries this year.
It was weird reading my summary of when, a couple of years ago,
I also went back to read old entries.
I got the the end and ended up feeling disappointed that there were no more.
I know what happens later, I lived it.

It is still hard to write.
I can't focus.
Is this anxiety still?

The plan was to get up early.
I could go pick up the lens and then do some photography with it.
I couldn't sleep until around 5h.
Could it be the tea?
It's supposed to be caffeine-free, but it's very weird.
The day before I didn't sleep much, I was supposed to be tired.

I postponed the alarm a lot of times until around noon.
The package wouldn't be ready until after 13h, anyway.
Did I eat first or did I shower?
I heated the sausages from yesterday and made two burritos with them.

This is easily the longest it has taken me to finish an entry.
I have less than an hour to finish.
Even now, I am gettings distracted.
I am still not halfway done.

I sent a message to my mum telling her that it was now sure that I'd
not be going to Tijuana.
Was this also today?

I showered and grabbed my stuff to go pick up the lens.
I didn't put the camera in the bag.
I didn't want to...

I can't even finish my sentences.
I keep losing the train of thought.
What is happening to me?

I keep thinking back about something of last night.
Something that has to do with the journal.
Some realization or insight that happened.
Maybe about the day that I wanted to share with Sonny,
the one where I narrate about the flirting with Patty.
Why do I feel so attached to that night?
Even more than the party at Sof's.

At the pharmacy there was a red line closing the corridors up to the
cashiers in the post office corner.
One worker saw me and told me the computer was down,
they'd be closed for around 15 minutes.
I just wandered around the pharmacy looking at the stuff.
On the way there I had seen that Paty sent me a message on Instagram.
She was inviting me to do something for her birthday.

I wanted to blew her off,
telling her that the trip from Canada was super expensive.
I just had told my mom that I would not be going.
There was something in her proposal that got to me.
I agreed.

I checked on the website and realized that there were some airlines with
way cheaper flights than Aeromexico.
I told Sonny and asked her if she could pay for my trip to Nayarit.
I could do the same with my parents.
When my mom suggested doing a videocall on Christmas,
there was something in the idea that put me off.

I feel nervous about asking Louis to leave off a week before the McGill
time off.

Later I would tell Sonny that I keep thinking back about Bacalar.
Those two guys from the boat place that kept misgendering me.
Will the same thing happen?
No make up, bathing suit, bad shaving.
I will probably be misgendered and look like shit in the pictures.

At least I have now a goal in mind to eat less and keep losing weight.

Yesterday—or was it the day before?—I went to the gym and did some cardio on
the treadmill and the standing bike.
I actually enjoyed it, way more than outside on the park, surprisingly.

I tried purchasing the flight, but it couldn't be confirmed.
I worried that it was something to do with my card.
I sent an e-mail and then called support center.
The lady said that it was because the fare was no longer available,
and I could just try again.
I got the same result on both the website and their phone app.
I tried it directly on the website of the airline, but that didn't pass either.
I guess it's an issue with the airline.

I'll try again tomorrow, or later this week.
There is not much difference in price with the other flight,
but for that one I would both need a PCR test for entering the US,
and also spent more than half a day traveling just to get to Mexico and
immediately get into another plane.

### Thursday, September 30th, 2021
I did not get up early nor did I go to use the new lens.
It was hard to fall asleep last night.

I shared the journal entry with Sonny.
As soon as it was delivered, I remembered the times I shared something with
her only for it to be ignored.
It was something that was probable to happen again.
The day I shared was the first one in which I mentioned her.

The first time I wrote again this year, after rereading the day,
I wanted to share it with someone.
No, I wanted to share it with anyone.
I even created an account on blogger to upload it.

Maybe we talked about it.
I don't really remember the time at which I finally fell asleep.

The alarm did sound this morning.
The screen blinked with the time.
It was 8h30.
I turned around and went back to sleep.
The sun was illuminating the whole room.
I still slept until noon.
There was the option of going out in the evening.

I craved pizza so much.
The idea was very tempting.
Today is the last day of September.
Tomorrow I'll need to transfer the money of the rent.
The stipend of the month is almost gone.
A couple of days ago I calculated the minimum amount I need to save to be
able to pay the tuition of the year.
A little less than 500 CAD.
I kept thinking about that when I considered ordering the pizza.
The doubt was alive for around 40 minutes.
Finally, I put on some rice on the stove and fried the rest of the sausages.

The food is almost gone.
There was half of the rice and another portion of the rice as leftover.
I could eat that tomorrow.
Or I could cook some pasta.

I remembered the thought that I kept coming back to.
It wasn't the first time that I did it.
I was on the reddit app when the username of Alice came to my mind and
with it the urge to look her up.
The idea that somehow she'd write something about that night was still in my head.

Years ago, after Paola had used my phone to log into Facebook,
I realized the account was still logged in.
In a serious breach of trust I looked at her conversation with the other Paola.
What I was looking for?
It was that same thought.
I was looking for some mention of me.
I can really hate myself sometimes.

I didn't buy the pizza.
A couple of hours after eating, I was still hungry and considered coming back
to eat the rest of the cooked food.
I didn't, but instead I finished all of the cookies.

In the morning, I tried again to order the plane ticket.
The same result came up.
I had thought yesterday that the next time, instead of the service help of
student universe I would call the number of the airline.
Instead, I felt a very familiar anxiety.
Yesterday I called the number without any issues,
why was the idea of calling today felt excruciating?
No, yesterday I sent the e-mail first.

I am getting distracted again.
I scheduled the appointment with Calli in my calendar.
With how I've been feeling lately,
it's possible that I'd end up forgetting the appointment.
Last session, I left with the idea that I wasn't saying everything stuck in my chest.
What do I feel the need to tell her about?

If the...

What did I want to say?

Right, the flights.
If the cheap overnight flight ends up being impossible to reserve,
the next cheap option is taking one with two layovers in the United States.
For that one, I'd need to take a COVID test, which are around 100 USD.
There is another one that is direct and isn't a red eye.
I could ask my paretns to pay for it.
I really don't like the idea.

It doesn't matter.

That flight to Mexico is business class.
It'd be the first time that I flight business.
I sent a message to my mom telling her.
She offered me to help with the tickets.

Honestly, I do want to go to Tijuana.
I do miss my family.
Nymeria.
I completely had forgotten about my little Nym.
At least I won't spend money in food.

My mum told me to wait for my dad so he can give me the info of his card.
She asked if I'll be buying the return flight, too.
I don't know if the border will be opening by next year.
I do hope so, but I don't know.
I doubt it.

## October, 2021

### Friday, October 1st, 2021
I’m on the couch in the living room.
I’m watching the squid game with Alda.
I had told myself I would not either spend any money or drink.
I spent around 15 dollars on snacks and a cider and I am drunk..

She just went to her room to roll a joint.
I’m glad she did.
Not because I could write faster, but because I really want to get more high.

We returned and continue watching the movie.
I’m high right now.
I’m not sure how drunk I am.
I had a cocktail with amaretto, then my cider and another cocktail double.
Alda hasn’t touched her second one.

I had lots of dreams.
I don’t remember most of them.
They had to do with my family, but I can’t recall almost anything.

I discarded the idea of going out with the camera as soon as I put my feet on
the floor.
I didn’t even fool myself with the idea of going later in the afternoon.
After all, it’s my last day off.

I reheated my bowl of rice and sausages and went to watch that soapy
teenager drama series.
I put it on only because I knew there was a trans character.
I’ve been having the need of watching myself in something.
That’s why I downloaded those movies the other time.
The story of wolfboy.
Something like that.

I feel hungry now.
Even though I ate more than I had planned

I kept thinking about the flight.
I really didn’t want to call.
I can’t pinpoint the reason why.
I looked at other airlines, other dates.
I found another one even cheaper.
Direct, too.
It was a Monday, though.
I sent a message to Sonny about it.
Was it like with my mum where I wanted to be subtle and indirectly asking
for their help?
If I were to buy that flight, I’d have to sleep a couple of nights with Sonny.
4 extra nights.
It sounds like a lot, but it’s not that many given the fact that I’ve spent
more at her house.
And she was like a month in mine.

I bought it.
Even though it’s a Monday flight, I could even hide it from Louis if I wanted to.
Just use the iPad in a very neutral place in our one to one meeting and
skip the social one.
For the ones next week I could take them in my parents house.
By then I’m sure I’d have mentioned it to him that I’d like to travel and
visit my parents.

Just now I realized that we would be busy on the 21st, a Monday.
I would need an excuse for that.
I’ll figure it out later.
Now that I have the flight there I’m starting to get excited.
Two months from now.

I stood and went to the toilet.
Alda asked me if I wanted her to pause the movie.
I said no.
When I returned she paused it to look for her phone.

Why don’t I want to go get groceries?
I almost have no food left.
I have some cereal and milk.
I have some pasta and cans of tomatoes.
There is a lot of chicken in the freezer and rice in the counter.
I have a package of ramen.

I can survive another couple of days.
Why don’t I want to do anything?
First it was the photo days.
Now it’s buying food.
What if Monday I don’t want to go to the lab?
I have to.
The building department said that it’d be the day when they’ll be testing
the fire alarm.
It’s also when they’re going to start taking off the ACs.
I don’t really want to be in here when they do that.
Since I moved, one of the light bulbs in my room is being turning on
intermittently.
Why haven’t I sent an email for them to replace it?

It’s going to be the weekend.
I asked Alda when the Dune movie is coming out as a subtle way of inviting her
to go see it.
Yesterday I saw that the venom movie is out.
I considered buying a ticket, but I don’t feel like going alone.
Even though is not that different to when I drink alone,
I really liked tonight.
We’re still sitting on the couch watching the series.
We didn’t talk much yet I feel a little less lonely than this morning.

When I woke up and saw Neto’s message,
I read this tweet about the trans and nb in academia workshop.

Did I talk about Neto’s message?

### Saturday, October 2nd, 2021
I don't know exactly what it is about today, but it feels gray and dark.
I haven't gone out of the apartment.
Last night I wrote the words in my phone.
Alda sent me a text earlier that day asking if I wanted to do something.
Before I agreed, she continued telling me we could go somewhere or stay in,
drink here and watch something.
We ended up doing the latter.

She rolled a joint and asked me to join her.
Out in the balcony, I proposed that we could go to the _dépanneur_ close to
the house and buy some snacks.
We got chocolates, grapefruit juice, and I got a can of cider for myself.
We continued watching the Squid Games.
We mixed the grapefruit juice with amaretto.
It wasn't that strong, but I did feel a little bit drunk.
We went outside and smoked again later that night before Armando got home.
She mentioned how she was, for sure, going to want to stay here and renew the
lease for next year.
Until she said it, I hadn't really thought about it.

What will happen when I decide to move?
What would happen if she didn't want to renew it?
Am I feeling anxious again?
At least she did say she wants to renew it.
It won't happen next year.

Time goes by so fast.
In two months Armando is going to move to Vancouver.
I guess soon he will post an ad about looking for someone to take his room.
It is the cheapest one and not that much smaller.
I guess it shouldn't take long before he-us?-find someone.

I have bought the plane ticket.
I'll be leaving to Mexico in a direct flight the second week of December.
Monday night, I think.
Evening.
The plane departs at 18h45.
I guess I should be leaving as soon as the Mondays' meeting ends.
Earlier this year I was desperate to come here.
Now I am excited about going back.
Is it because I did end up missing my family?

These past few days I started worrying whether my mum would tell me if
anything happens to Nymeria.
Reading the journal entries of those early years made me feel so conscious
about my past and what has happened.

Yesterday, in the morning, I woke up to several notifications of Neto.
I had messages from him in Instagram and was also added to a messenger group.
It was his birthday, but his messages had nothing to do with that.
The ones from Instagram were about asking how I've been doing and sharing with
me an ad he saw about activism in Mexico.
The messenger group was called _botellón_.
It had several of the people I met in Salamanca, and some that I never did.
In them I recognized Pablo, Consuela, a couple of the Italians and Nina.
In the members there was also Caio, but he didn't send any message.
Neto is moving to the UK to do a master's and was considering planning some
sort of reunion in Italia.

Pablo posted the idea about reuniting in Salamanca,
but maybe it was better to leave it until the 10th year anniversary.
What was it in that message that moved me so much?
Was it the time?
Imagining myself going back to Spain, and Salamanca specifically, well, as me?

One of the nights that I wandered around drunk and melancholic I fantasized
so much about returning.
From all the reunions that I can think about,
that one is the one I'd actually consider going to.

I feel no interest in seeing the people from college nor high school.
Absolutely not the people from middle school.

What is it from that moment in life that calls me back?

I decided on my name in a bus trip looking out the window to the landscapes
of Spain.
Was it the trip to Valencia?
I might have written about that moment in the journal.
Not this one, though.
If it is, it's in the one that Catherine gifted me.
That's where I transcribed the notes from my phone.

Is this my home now? This apartment, this room? Why doesn't it feel like it?

Tomorrow I should go and buy some food.
Monday I must go to the lab.
I don't want to be here either for when the fire alarm goes off
or if they decide to come uninstall the ACs.

Lately, I've been having that feeling so much: _not wanting to be here_.

### Sunday, October 3rd, 2021
I had put on this website that I'd try again the monthly challenge of writing everyday.
As a reward for successfully clearing the challenge,
I put in there that I would treat myself with a pizza night.
The last couple of days, I've been craving it a lot.
In the morning, thinking about the amount of food and money,
I usually make up my mind and decide not to order it.
This day, I had set the goal to get out of the apartment and go buy some groceries.
I did both.

Just now, I grabbed the phone and had this urge to look into Instagram.
Just put the names of the people that I've muted and see if there's anything new.
Why do I look for them if I've muted them?
I really don't want to talk about them today.

Yesterday I didn't really know what to do with my last days off.
I rebooted my PC and logged into Windows.
Somehow I decided to try again that game that I apparently had downloaded
some years ago, Steins;Gate.
I knew about it after playing Katawa Shoujo.
How many years ago was this?
Easily more than 10.
I must have been in High School.
No, maybe I was in the first year of university.
I remember being tempted to tell Anahi about it?

I knew two things about the game.
It had to do with Time Travel and it has a trans woman as a character.
She was treated horribly by the writers.

I hated it.
Well, kind of.
I couldn't stand the main character.
I mean, the game is a dating simulator, which I guess I am not the
intended public to start with.
I couldn't stand too much of it.
When I got to the trans character and how she was continuously misgendered by
the main character and the whole time treated as a joke.

Was that the reason that I read about this other anime?
Wonder egg priority.
I've just finished it.
It also has a trans character.
Well, kind off. _All but outly stated_,
was the comment of the redditor that recommended it.
They also said that it had some issues and should be watched with a critical eye.
I didn't care, I just wanted some representation.
I am desperate to seeing someone like myself.

It was... fine.

It was never explicitly stated that Momoe was actually trans herself.
There were several signs that were very recognizable.
What cis tomboy actually cries after being seen as a boy?
It hurt a little that I could see myself in her wet face asking the
protagonist _What do I look like to you?_

I watched half of the season yesterday and left the rest for today.
I thought I could order some pizza, and buy some ciders and watch it.
That I did.

I woke up around noon, again.
Armando was cleaning the apartment, as it is his turn.
I hesitated before going out of my room and taking a shower.
I don't really remember how much it took me.

I did shower eventually.
I'm wearing the gray hoodie—the one which Nymi ate its pocket—and a black pair
of leggings.
I went to buy food.
On the way there Armando sent a message telling us that he'll post the ad
offering the room soon.
He's also going to sell his stuff but first wanted to ask us if we wanted to
buy them from him.
It's the pots and pans, the glasses and dishes—basically almost everything
from the kitchen—and some stuff from our bathroom.
There was some stuff that I'd actually like to see leaving,
but some that would be convenient to keep.
I told him that I would love to buy some stuff from him,
but he blew me off and said that he'd prefer to sell us everything for
around 130 dollars.
If he'd still have to offer the stuff,
he'd rather sell everything for a higher price.
I posted that I'd wait to hear Alda's thoughts.
I thought about the internet and how if, she didn't want it,
I would certainly hate to pay the full amount myself for a bunch of,
practically, thrash.

I had said to him that, personally,
I was only interested in a handful of things,
so maybe it would be better for everyone if he puts them up for sale and I
buy the stuff I want myself new.
Alda seemed to agree with me.
His stuff is not of that good quality, and although she'd love to help him,
the price he's asking is way too high.
She told him that she's a little short on money,
but she might buy some stuff from him, anyway.

He seemed a little salty and even said that he might ship everything to BC
and sell it there.

Later he asked us if we preferred that the new roommate is a girl or
if we don't mind.
I answered first that yes, a girl, preferably.

Will she have a problem living with me?

### Monday, October 4th, 2021
When was the last time that I had seen Sonny, even on a screen?
It's been a while, for sure.

Like other times, when she called me I got irritated.
I hung up soon after because I was watching one of the videos of that guy
who had showed up with Jared on YouTube.
He was talking about Evangelion and the hedgehog's dilemma.
His wife is a Lacanian psychoanalyst.
I recognized some of the ideas that he had shared in Jared's video.
Sonny's usual MO is to call me, and as soon as I am convinced to talk,
minutes after she called me in the first place, she doesn't answer anymore.
I end up suspending what I am doing in the first place.
I thought it was going to happen the same thing.
I counted 4 minutes after I told her to call me and sent her a message with
an ellipsis.
She misunderstood the message as her iPhone telling her that I was writing.
We laughed about it and talked for around half an hour.

Did I talk about yesterday's event with Armando and his stuff?
He said he would be taking the stuff to take pictures of it for the ads.
He's leaving in two months.
He took some of the stuff to his room.
I guess he's being a little bit salty.
Maybe he wants to punish us in a way for not wanting his things.
I thought about sending Alda a message telling her that maybe we should go soon
to Dollarama to pick up some dishes.
Whatsapp has being down most of the day.
Facebook and Instagram, too.
Curiously, today was the day that I've been _most_ productive.

Not really productive, as I haven't really advanced much in my work.
Yet, I've been working most of the day, since around 8h or 9h until 18h.

Yesterday I thought that I should get up early and go to the lab.
I didn't want to be home today for the fire alarm testing,
and possibly their taking of the ACs.

Yesterday I ordered the pizza and fries and finished the anime.
I was so invested in the 'trans-coded' character,
that it literally hurt the disappointment,
that it never really got explicitly stated that she's trans.
It's been years since I've heard the term _headcanon_.
Especially in the context of LGBT representation.
Am I just now this need of seeing someone with whom I can relate?

Maybe it has to do with the alienation characteristic of this late times.

There were some poeple who were really convinced that she was not trans.
She was **obviously** a cis girl, just a tomboy.
To them, it was idiotic to think otherwise.
Silly people who are looking for stuff that is not there.
How dare they take her from me?
As I told Monica, it's so hard to find someone to which I can relate.

Before I was conscious of what was going on with me,
I remember being fixated on those gender-bender mangas.
Yesterday I got to one that I remember reading so long ago.
This person who's hit by an alien spaceship and changed into a girl.
Then she finds herself in some love triangle.
Reading it now, there are some themes that seemed familiar.
I felt uncomfortable writing that last sentence as the memory of being lost
between Catherine and Monica when I myself was just learning how to be a girl.

I don't know if it's the hurt that comes with the memories or if that sentence
is actually as pathetic as I feel it is, but I literally cringed after writing it.

The first real and explicit transgender representation that I met was _Horo Musuko_,
or _wandering son_.
It wasn't relieving nor illuminating.
It was awkward and uncomfortable.
It hurt a lot.
I'm not sure, but I think I actually had to abandon it the first time and
didn't return to it until months later.
I'd like to say, even if roughly, how long ago that was,
but honestly I have no idea.
It could had been in high school.
Maybe it was later, when I was in college and figuring out myself.
I honestly don't know.

Yesterday I considered going back to it,
but it was too much and I easily discarded the idea.

It was two weeks ago when I didn't sleep the whole night.
It was the night before my apointment with Calli.
Last night, again, I didn't sleep.
I got up around 5h or 6h and made myself a cup of coffe.
I watched the episode of Y: The Last Man—another comic that I read maybe a
decade ago—and then got to work.

I feel tired now.
Maybe I should make use of this oportunity and try to reset my inner clock.

### Wednesday, October 6th, 2021
Are you fucking serious?

I did cheat yesterday, but I tried.
It was between 20 and 15 minutes before midnight when I remembered the words.
I grabbed my phone and did what I used to do when was too busy to do the words
but didn't want to lose the streak.
I copied and pasted "cheater" as if insulting myself or admitting wrongdoing
made any difference.
I checked—double checked—that the words were saved and the day was marked done.

I actually thought about and considered skipping today.
I feel tired and there's a dampened urge to cry buried deep in my chest.
I opened this site after brewing my tea instead of going back to the Lacan book.
There is a diagonal slash instead of a cross.
I know what that means.
I won't overexplain just to fill the words.

I had my appointment with Calli today.
There was no mention of the stuff I kept silenced two weeks ago.
Maybe I'll come back to this idea.

Couple of moments ago, I put on the search bar of youtube _trans representation_,
again. What am I looking for?

What did I do yesterday?

I didn't sleep at all.
No.
That was Sunday and Monday's morning.
I should have written about that in Monday's words.
Monday was the lab's meeting.
I did not go to the lab that day.
Why did I think of Vicky?
She's not been going to the meetings.
I can't remember the last time that I saw her.
Perhaps when I presented Qrater and she said that because of the lack of
private datasets, she'd not be able to use it herself.

That was months ago.
Louis sent an e-mail today for something.
Right, next Monday will be holiday,
so the Neuro meeting will be moved to the week after.
Her name was in the list of addressees.
I got an e-mail today, as I mentioned to Calli in our session,
for the Queer Club meeting in Jeanne-Mance.
There was a link at the end of the mail,
inviting the reader to join the Facebook Group.
By that point I already suspected that I would not go to the meeting.
The group was private—like Vicky's potential datasets—non-members of the
group can't see who's a part of it.
Once I was accepted, I was now able to see the other members.
One of them she was.

Yesterday I woke up early-ish.
I even showered before Armando.
After he took most of his stuff out of the kitchen,
Alda and I agreed to go to the store and buy some of the stuff to replace what
was now gone.
I went to the lab and pretended, enough to fool myself, to work.
I don't remember much of what happened.
I ate a sandwich and was alone most of the day at the lab.
Vlad came into the room for a minute.
He grabbed a monitor and asked me if I had seen about the picnic when he was leaving.

I made a stop at the library and checked out a first book.
The first volume of Lacan's seminar.
Just now I posted a tongue-in-cheek story on Instagram about doing
neuroscience by day and reading psychoanalysis by night.
Probably it'll go ignored like most of the stuff I post and/or say.

Alda and I went yesterday to Dollarama and bought some stuff that wouldn't be
available from IKEA.
We talked a bit about how it'll be after Armando leaves.
He posted now the ad for the room.
I was nervous when I read what he had to say.
Would he say, like some of the ads that I saw earlier this year,
that the current tenants are a bi cis woman and a lesbian trans woman?

I could have talked about that in today's session with Calli,
but didn't really want to.

I went to bed tired, but still struggled to actually fall asleep.
I didn't want to get up today.
I didn't want to the day to begin.
Time's running out, but I don't know for what.

I went to the lab again.
After all, there was the appointment with Calli in the afternoon.
Last night I ate very late, after returning from Dollarama.
Today I didn't pack a lunch.
Calli asked me what was the plan for the afternoon, what did I see myself doing.
Maybe a cup of tea, relaxing.
I made a stop at the dépanneur on the way home where I bought tea and noodles.

As I was cooking, Alda told me that it smelled veery good.
I thought about offering her some of my meal,
but hesitated and then just thanked her.

Talking about the decorations of the apartment,
I told Alda that I considered printing some of my pictures for hanging in my
room or the apartment.
I shared some with her and shyly told her that she was allowed to tell me that
she didn't like any.
She replied back that they were quite nice.
I had asked Sonny to tell me which one she liked,
but never really looked at them and days passed.

Later, I would ask Monica the same question.
She told me that she was tired and wanted to give me the final answer,
so, could she answered me back today?
This morning she said that even though she doesn't know about photography,
she can actually see that I have talent.

Do I?
Why does it feel like those days when I was young and girls would share around
my notebook with stupid and cheesy poetry?
They're not that good.
The poems, the pictures, me.

We're not that special.

### Thursday, October 7th, 2021
The plates and stuff from Ikea came in.
I still have not bought the canvas pictures.
I looked at them yesterday.
I have Monica's and Sonny's recommendations.
Why can't I just order some and be done with it?

I, again, had a very hard time falling asleep last night.
I think the last time I saw the time it was around 2h.
I didn't put an alarm, did I?
Maybe they're automatic with the iPhone.
I think the default setting was set for every weekday.
I looked into buying the plane ticket to Tijuana from Guadalajara.
Just now, I tried openning the volaris airline website in another tab.

At first I looked for the flight in the studentuniverse app.
It doesn't list the cheap airlines.
I used another flights aggregator and found out the cheapest flights were from
volaris instead of vivaaerobus.
When I tried to make the reservation, the website wouldn't really load.
It would throw a random error and keep switching the listed prices between
canadian dollars and mexican pesos.

When I tried later today, the website wouldn't even load.
I haven't checked the tab, really.

Moments ago, I was lying on the bed, a little bit high and very tired.
I didn't want to write the words.
What's the point anymore?
The streak is over.
I lost, again, the monthly challenge.

Yesterday I received an e-mail that in the next couple of days
I'd receive a bank deposit for 200 dollars.
I used that as an excuse for buying the canvases.
Today, I used them in a similar way to accept Alda's invitation for going to a
beer festival this weekend.
Now—as in right now—that I'm writing this sentence,
I don't feel like going anymore.

Yesterday I told Calli that there was going to be a meeting in the park for
the Queer group.
She was excited.
No, she was excited when I mentioned Louis encouragement for going out and
doing something.
She tried to convince me subtly to go, but then she was understanding as well,
saying that not going was totally fine.
By the end of the session, she mentioned that I had worked a lot.

"What's the worst thing that could happen tonight,
what is this impending doom that deep down you think might happen?"

"Well, in the worst case, I would feel overwhelmed by the emotions again.
I could go and buy a bottle of, something, and get very very drunk.
And, again, in the worst worst case, I could even end up cutting myself again."

I posted a set of two stories to Instagram.
The first pictures was of the two monitors,
one with a figure from a paper and the other one with a vim session opened.
There was a textbox that said: _computational neuroscientist in the streets_.

The second picture I took it last night,
after having a cup of tea.
It was the title page of the book I took out of the library:
_lacanian psychoanalyst in the sheets_.

I got a lot of comments on those.
Most from psychologists themselves.
Claudia reacted to them and even commented.
She worked with Yadira, of course she would.
Saren did, too. Commented, I mean, not working with Yadira.

Right now, I got a wave of memories from University.
The Faculty and our free time between classes.
Walking around, not really doing nothing.
Maybe laughing.

Anahi sent a message.
I've always been a hipster, it said.
We continued talking.
No, I continued the conversation.
I told her that hopefully the border will open and we can go shopping when
I go there in December.
After talking a bit about that, she asked me if I wasn't going to go to
Eusebio's and Jessica's weeding.
I told her that I didn't think so, as I wasn't invited.

We then talked more about that.
I talked, basically.
I told her the story of how Monica let me know what Omar said to her that time
that he gave her the box of her stuff.
The reason why I put distance between me and the group.
Well, not really put distance, just stopped looking them up.

I wanted to finish this words and go back to bed.
I still do.
When the alarm sounded in the morning,
I turned around and continued sleeping until 10 in the morning.
I grabbed my clothes and went to the bathroom to shower.
In there, I decided I didn't really want to go and wrote an e-mail that I was
feeling a bit under the weather and it'd be better if I skipped the reunion.

Louis replied to me to feel better and Reza that their here in the building now,
and let him know if I needed anything.

I didn't do any real work the rest of the day.

### Saturday, October 9th, 2021
Friday and Saturday.
Again, I did not do the words.
This time I don't feel guilty, really.
Maybe having that half-done day was a good thing.

I got up Friday with the intention of doing some work,
but the whole day passed and I did nothing.
In Teams Vlad sent a message saying how since yesterday they had a
long social meeting, maybe we/they could cancel Friday's.
This was half an hour before the scheduled time.
I had not showered, I think.
I didn't connect.
I considered it.
I opened the app, but I never clicked 'connect'.
They had some sort of meeting.
There were some messages in the chat from Vlad and Etienne.
Up the corner in the app, three or four names appeared on the screen as
participants of the call, but none of them were Louis'.

I showered and changed.
There was the beer fest that afternoon.
Alda had the tickets.
She told us they were 30 dollars per head.
Armando decided not to go.
Since he had his meeting, getting there after 19h wasn't really worth it.
I understood.
Vix and Lizzie were also going, Alda would tell me later.

I put on the pink shirt that I bought in Tijuana were I was my skinniest.
I was misgendered wearing that shirt in one of my dates with Sonny.
I looked at myself in the full-body mirror of the restrooms of the train
station where the beer fest was happening and actually liked how I looked.
I liked me.

_Silly Sofia, that you think you look like a woman._

I'm just coming back from the kitchen.
I really wanted a drink and looked at Alda's bottles above the fridge.
I could make myself a drink, she wouldn't mind.
The bottles are almost done.
I decided against it.
Maybe I could go buy some alcohol for myself.
No, I should not spend too much money on alcohol anymore.
I just woke up today with a hangover.
Why do I keep wanting to do this to me?

I wore black jeans, a brown tank top and the pink and cream shirt over it open
with the sleeves rolled up.
Alda sent me a message a quarter before 17h to get ready to leave soon.
I went to the restroom and put on make up.
There was something in that face that I didn't like.
It looks fake.
Like a bad covering of the male features that I want to get rid off,
but, instead of being hidden, they just look more obvious.

I waited for her in the couch reading my book.
She wanted to have some shots before leaving.
She served them in Armando's mason jar shot glasses.
They hold maybe twice the amount of a conventional shot.
I mentioned how I was feeling a bit of a buzz on the way there.

We arrived before Vix and Lizzie.
The people checking the vaccine passports spoke spanish.
The woman first look at my passport and said: _oh, mexicana_,
before continuing with the instructions in Spanish.
They gave us two beer glasses and a card with 20 points for ordering the
beer tasters.

We got to our table and left the stuff there.
The other guys had not arrived yet.
We went to the restroom and I looked at myself in the mirror.

We did the line for the beers.
I browsed the list of options and decided to get the package filled with dark
strong beers.
Stouts and a Porter.
There was one from 'Dieu du ciel!',
Alda pointed it out and mentioned how we should go to that place again.

When we returned to the tables with our beers,
Vix and Lizzie were already sitting there with theirs.
I was going to write how it was similar to that time we went to St Laurent
Boulevard and the restaurant in old port, but that is not true.

That time there was also Vix and another girl friend of them,
but this time I didn't feel as apart.
With Lizzie I felt a bit more included in the conversations.
She mentioned how there was going to be a party later from a friend of hers,
near Hochelaga, if we wanted to go.
It was going to be inside a church.
We made some jokes and were really intrigued by the idea.
A party inside a church.
Drinking inside a church.
Even if just to cross the item from a bucket list, I really wanted to go.

Lizzie mentioned how she didn't tell Vix that it was in a church because she
worried that he would not want to.
We were wanting to have something to eat.
Somebody suggested german sausages,
but there were no restaurants that offered them nearby.
Vix mentioned this app that lets him grab a car and use it.
He proposed that we could grab one, leave our stuff in there,
and go somewhere to eat before the party.
Maybe we could eat at Winston Churchill,
where Danny's working and some people were already there.
Did I know then that those some people meant Molly and her friends?

They ordered more beers and I finished my original four.
We stopped at a SAQ on the way when we were looking for the car.
Lizzie and I were looking for a bottle of gin for her friend.

"He's a pilot", she said.

She picked one with 'aviation' on the bottle.
It was cute, the meaning behind the gesture.
Alda and Vix went around looking for our own alcohol.
They decided on a bottle of Greek licquor.
Today I sent Alda a transfer for 10 dollars, but she hasn't accepted it yet.

We continued walking trying to find the car.
Lizzie wanted to pee.
Alda brought up the question about peeing on the streets.
Once she had me and Armando and casually mentioned she was more interested in
my answer.
I guess it's because I'm a woman.
Maybe she didn't know or remembered I have a penis.

We couldn't find the car, so we would go directly to the bar.
Karina would meet us there.
Maybe then it was when Vix mentioned Molly?
No, probably he said her name in the beer fest.
It doesn't really matter, I guess.

We arrived at the bar and got in line.
When we got to the entrance,
the guard asked Lizzie if there were alcohol in her bag.
She tried to say it was a birthday gift,
but he repeated the question without listening, signaling he didn't care.

"I can't let you in with any alcohol."

Maybe that was before the search of the car.
Yeah, that's correct.
That happened, we looked for the car, and, after we didn't find it,
decided to go back and stash the alcohol in an alley.
Lizzie and Alda put it under a traffic cone.
Molly and her friends were standing outside the bar when we returned.

We got in and returned to the table where they were sitting.
They took their places to the right side of the booth.
Alda and Vix were the first to sit, next to them, on the other end.
Lizzie was ahead of me and my heart started rushing.
I would not fit next to her.
I turned my head and saw the empty spot on the wrong end, the one next to Molly.

"You can sit here", Lizzie said breaking my train of thought,
as she was moving closer to Vix to make some space for me.

I did not see Molly looking in my direction the whole night.
I did ruin everything when I sent her that 'joke' message.
Of course it would be awkward later.

We went upstairs to check the second floor.
Vix got in looking for Danny, and we stayed behind in the lobby upstairs.
Karina arrived while we were there.
Lizzie had told us she had warned her that Carol was there as well.
I don't really know the backstory.
Maybe she's the girl that tried something with Danny, Karina's boyfriend.
The one Karina was mentioning at the bar after the jazz fest.
Is she also the new roommate of Molly?
The thing Vix was saying about feeling like a betrayal and the mixture of those
two worlds.

Lizzie started telling me about Molly.
See, Molly was her friend.
She was with her when Molly was going through a bad breakup.
She had not seen Molly in months and was really excited about seeing her tonight.
_She barely said hi. Why would she do that? Is it because she's 22?_

_She's not 22 though_, I thought.
It was her birthday in August so she turned 23.

"And I was a little bit like _yea, I don't really wanna be a part of this
conversation, lol_", I told Armando today about the drama of that bar.

Why do they keep asking me about my dating life?
Maybe it was when Alda and Vix left looking for another car.
Lizzie asked me and I told her the truth.
I dated for a while, but decided to take a break.
When I returned the question, she said that she was on the apps.

Why would she want to know?
Did I?
If not, why would I return the question?
I thought she was seeing that dancer guy.

Vix asked me—again—as well.
I told him the same thing.
I knew why he asked.
Molly was there.
Alda had told him that she wasn't sure about inviting me to Molly's birthday
because I had asked her out and it didn't happen and things could be awkward.
The next day, when we met, he asked me about my dating life and then asked me
why I hadn't attended the party the night before.
When I returned the question to him,
he said something about it being different for guys.
As if I didn't know.

Lizzie and Karine went somewhere.
Aiden, Molly's friend that we met that night of the jazz fest, arrived.
He sat next to me and we started chatting.
I don't remember most of what he said.
He asked about the beer fest.
I told him about my favorite, this stout that was aged in a bourbon barrel.
He said it sounded fancy and that he was thinking about going himself.
_He likes beers, he even has a tattoo of them._
He asked me if I wanted to see it.
Before I answered, he started lifting up his shirt.
Molly looked his way and started laughing.

"Molly has one as well."

"Yeah, I've also seen hers.
There's another friend who got it, right?", I interrupted him.
"Just one left before seeing all of them and completing the collection."

Right after that I sent a message to Monica,
how I wasn't sure that Molly's friend was hitting on me.
At the time it felt like that.
Now I can see that he wasn't.

Lizzie came and he turned towards me and abandoned our conversation.
Even though I wasn't interested in him, it still hurt.
Of course I couldn't really compete with a woman like Lizzie.
She's way more attractive than me.
She's way more obviously cis than me.

Karina was telling the people about the party in the church.
First the male friend, and later the venezuelan girl.
I didn't really want them to come, did I?
How would I had felt if they had gone?
Maybe none of the drama would had happened,
as if I'd have been way too busy dealing with my own awkwardness and
avoiding Molly.

We waited for Aiden.
He would be the only one to join us.
I was cold, but not as cold as when we arrived to the parking lot of the church.

We had a hard time finding the entrance.
There was some door somewhere and I think we took some stairs that led us to
some kind of basement.
Some people wrestling in a fighting ring.
There were not as many people as I would have imagined.
It felt awkward at first.

"Thank you guys for coming,
I really don't know what I'd have done if I'd have come alone", said Lizzie.

We met the host.
He offered us some coke.
We took some drinks instead and moved over the ring.
They were messing around for a bit.

I remember now, how when we got into the car, Lizzie offered to sit on Aiden's lap.
I can't remember if she actually went there.
I don't think so.
Aiden was navigating Vix.
No, at first it was Lizzie, but her phone was set for walking,
so she directed him through a one-way street.
That was from the back seat.
Aiden took over after that, and he was sitting at the front.
At the ring he was trying to support her on his feet.
I sent a picture of that to Monica.

Maybe I should continue tomorrow? In four minutes this log will lock.

### Sunday, October 10th, 2021
We decided to go explore the rest of the church.
After refilling our drinks, we went throught the door into the main room.
There were pidgeon shit in the podium where the father would give the sermon.
We were already drunk.
Someone gave out cigarettes and we smoked right there in the front.
We took several pictures of around the place.
I don't remember exactly,
but it could had been my idea to go check the confession booths.

I got in to the further one in the right.
It was dark.
Lizzie sat in the one in the middle.
There was a light switch in there.
I could see her clearly, but she could not see me.
We swapped places.
The one in the middle was the one for the priest.

"I'll be the father, then."

Still, Lizzie and Aiden wanted me to confess my sins.

"I don't really have any. I mean, I have sins, but I don't repent them."

Did they want me to confess to something specifically?
Aiden said something about me being a priest.
Later, when I offered if someone wanted to take over me being the priestess,
he apologized.

That should had been the first red flag, but I didn't think much of it.

We lost Lizzie.
Aiden, too.
I followed Karina and went up some wooden stairs.
They were dark and full of cobwebs.
The further we went up they felt more dangerous and scary.
We got to the top of the bell room.
The view was amazing.
The people told Lizzie how they have been there for years and never knew about
that place.
We didn't stay longer than 5 minutes before coming back down again.
I illuminated the way for Karina and stepped down backwards.

When we got to the basement again I saw Aiden sitting in there.
He told me how he left Lizzie stranded because he was scared of heights.
He had fallen of a tractor once.
Or something like that.
He had been close to death several times.
Was it three?
I don't remember.
I wasn't paying much attention to what he was saying.
Lizzie came and sat on his lap as we were talking.
I feel as if I'm mixing up the events.
I moved from where I was sitting.
It was obvious she was interested in him.
I wasn't, and yet I felt a lot of different things that I had never felt before.

"Pero aun así, sí sentí como _la competencia_.
Y la inseguridad [...]
I mean, even if I were attracted to him, I'm not in the same league as her".

I don't remember when exactly,
but Lizzie came a little bit sad and said that Aiden didn't want her around.
It was before we went out.

He was lying on the floor.
Drunk? We didn't know.
He wasn't feeling well, or at least didn't look like it.

"Do you mind if I sit her with you?
It's fine if you don't want to."

I sat on the side, a bit far, but still next to him.
I don't remember if we were talking about anything before Lizzie came out.
Maybe she saw me with him and wanted to mark her territory again.
Did she feel that I was into him somehow?
Was I acting like that?

She sat over him, or hugged him, or something.
He blew her off, hard.
It was harsh.
He told her to please go inside, he didn't want her close.
He appreciated, he was flattered, but he wasn't interested.
He had just ended a relationship with someone, so please, leave him alone.

"Do you want me to leave, too?", I asked him.

He said no.

He was annoyed, and when she left, he continued letting it all out to me
between some 'man's and 'bro's.
I remembered the confessionary and suddenly felt as dysphoric as I hadn't felt
in a long time.
How stupid of me to think he was interested in me,
or that Lizzie saw me as competition.
He knew I was trans and saw me as a man.
Probably since that very first night.
All of them knew, surely.
I'm Alda's tranny roommate.
Guys are not interested in me.
Molly wasn't interested in me.
Flore wasn't interested in me.

Not much after that, we left the church.
Lizzie decided to stay for a bit.
Probably she didn't want to leave with Aiden.
I stayed a couple of moments with her, but I can't really say why.
What did I expect from that action?

In the car, Karina and Aiden continued talking about it.
_It is unfair that the situation is not judged the same becuase of gender_,
Karina was telling him.

Vix drove us first to our apartment.
I hugged Karina good-bye.
Aiden moved from his seat and extended his arms toward me as well.

"Sofia, thank you very much for staying with me."

"And you know what's the shittiest part?
I actually liked how I looked earlier that night." I texted Monica.
"Me acuerdo en el beer fest cuando fui al baño con Alda.
Nos detuvimos al ver que había full-body mirrors.
Claramente recuerdo que me vi en ellos y me gusté.
I was feeling good with myself
Después de ese momento, todo se vino abajo y me sentí como un bicho raro;
sentí que la piel me quedaba chica.

"And the dude probably didn't even notice what he did."

In the morning, I got Monica's message asking me if I was already awake
and to tell her the complete story.
I felt smoke in my throat and ashes in my eyes.
I tried to go back to sleep.
I heard Armando's friend arriving and, in a half-conscious state,
I listened to their conversation in spanish.

I got a message from Alda asking me how I was feeling.
She told me she forgot her bag in the car and she had missed her shift as
she was leaving for her sister's.
She was also feeling sick.

I ate some of Armando's discada.

He told us if we had an issue with him renting out the room to a friend of his
who's moving from Mexico.
He's gay.
I'd lie if I said I wasn't a bit disappointed, but whatever.
I'm OK with it, I guess.

I went to the gym.
I ran almost three miles.
It was a brisk walk.
45 minutes.
Do I feel better?

### Wednesday, Ocotber 13th, 2021
The missing days make me stop caring about writing in this journal.
I can't remember the reason for why I skipped Monday's—maybe I just forgot.
Yesterday I consciously didn't feel like it.
I felt very tired and decided to just stay in bed reading for a while and
go to sleep.
I haven't been sleeping very well lately.
Maybe that was the reason I've been feeling constipated.

Should I write about what has happened these past few days or just continue
from today?
I have this little journaling app that I've been using lately.
It could serve as a guide.

I've been going to the gym lately.
First it started just as an experiment.
The first time I really liked, even though I told Calli that it wasn't that
useful for my mood.
This week when I went to sign up to use it,
I decided to write down my name for the rest of the week.

"Emotional work is like doing physical exercise.
It's healthier to let it rest after a hard work."

I'll be going every other day.
After the excitement of the first time,
when I went it was actually harder and I felt a bit disappointed.
Maybe it would be another habit that wouldn't stick, like jogging in Mont-Royal
or using the pool.

Sunday I went to the thrift store looking for clothes for the costume.
I know it was Sunday and not Monday,
because I didn't know if they would be open on Monday.
So, I guess Monday I did not go out.
The logger app says I went to the gym and even had coffee.
Other than that it was just reading.

After feeling let down with my search for trans representation in media,
I went looking for books.
By then I had been reading the Lacan book that I checked out of the library.
That made me think about looking for fiction books from that library.

No, that's not true at all.
After going to the gym, I thought I could try listening to audiobooks in the
treadmill.
I downloaded the audible app remembering that there's supposed to be a free
book each month.
Actually, you have to enroll in a monthly subscription to get those benefits.
That's how I got into the libraries.
There are available audiobooks there to download.
After loaning some e-books and even putting some on hold,
I haven't really downloaded any audiobook.

I've finished one and am halfway through another.
Most of all of the books I had in the ipad app have a trans protagonist.
I guess it's something to satisfy that urge to see someone like myself
somewhere.

I think I did work Monday.
I worked a bit on the MX project.

Yesterday I went to the lab.
I ate the first of the frozen burritoes I cooked some time ago,
but not at the lab.
Reza was there.
He asked me how I was feeling when he came in.
I'm not sure if it was just because he cared,
or if he was worried about getting sick, too.

I wasn't as productive as I wanted, but still it was way better than today.

Today I had this Alzheimer's seminar early in the morning.
I went to bed early—as I mentioned before, it was why I skipped the day again.
Unfortunately, I slept only 4 hours until midnight.
Then I couldn't go back to sleep.
The conference was going to open at 7h30.
I think I finally fell asleep around 6h.
Right then and there,
I realized it was not going to be an option getting up for a conference to
which I wouldn't even pay attention.
I woke up only to go to the gym.

The real reason that I signed up to the gym was because I tried on the
_costume_—even though by yesterday I had already confirmed my worry that the
idea of dressing up as a schoolgirl was ridiculous—and the
skirt didn't really fit.

I asked Monica for her opinion.
Even though she didn't really get—at least to my knowledge—my worry that it
was basically a way to fulfill my preconscious need to live a youth life-stage
that I didn't get to experience, she agreed that it would be tacky.

Instead, I decided to dress as Steven Universe.

When I was young I would fantasize about the idea of wearing a girl's costume,
and now, that it is expected,
I have decided to wear one of a male character.

### Thursday, October 14th, 2021
_I really took it to heart with the_ being brief.

I cried today half an hour after my meeting with Louis.
He's so nice that I doubt he's actually disappointed in me.
But, how could he not be?

Last night I slept early and actually slept through the whole night.
I could had gotten out of bed even earlier than my alarm.
I decided to go back to sleep in any case and continued dreaming.
Nothing interesting.
Somehow I travelled back in time and chatted with Miguel in my mom's school.
There was no mention of me looking different, or being a woman,
so I guess in that reality I hadn't transitioned.
I wasn't conscious of that until in the morning that I was thinking about the
dream.

Last night, as I was wondering about the contact lenses,
I took a picture of me without glasses so I could see how I'd look.
Back to the first time that I tried to wear them, I was still in university so
my facial features were of no interest of mine.
Yesterday, though, I realized how my eyes look smaller.
Not only that, but my forehead looks rough.
_Rough brow bone bossing_ came up when I searched it in google.
I went through the rabbit hole looking at sexual dymorphism in skulls.
After half an hour I was browsing Facial Feminization Surgeries and their prices.
I felt as dysphoric as those first years.

I don't remember if I had my coffe or if I showered first.
Probably the latter.
The meeting with monsier Charron was at 9h30.
I put on the blouse that looks like a white shirt under a gray sweater.
I know Sonny really likes it.

I got distracted on the work computer,
and then talking with my mum about the soon opening of the border and my trip
home.

My head is starting—no, it's not hurting, really, but I do feel tired.
I've also been having low back pain.
It's not really in my back, but not on my abdomen either.
It's really weird.

I was the first to connect to the teams meeting in the morning.
It was just Louis and monsier Charron's—secretary? assistant?—soon after,
everyone else started to come in.

I'm starting to cry and I'm not sure why.
I do have an idea.

It's gone.
The tears are drying but the heavy pull in my chest is still there.

I was the third-to-last to present in Louis' slides.
My slides were the fewest.
My participation was the shortest, too.
I made a joke at the beginning of my meeting with Louis;
he didn't make any comment about my particular participation.

I presented in my pajama pants.
I might have been wearing almost the same outfit as my first interview with
Louis and his lab.
This formal-ish top with comfier pants.

As soon as the meeting was finished,
I went upstairs to the lobby to pick up the package with my new sweaters and skirt.
I tried the new clothes and the possible costume and took pictures of me
wearing each thing.
Even though there was only one picture of my whole face—the rest only included
parts of it—I hated most of them.
I cropped them before sharing them with Monica and asking her opinions.

The sweaters were bigger than they should be.
They're M, but still they look baggy on me.
The skirt is L and yet I took it off without unzipping it.
Maybe my grandma could fix it a bit if I see her.

Even though I told Louis I would be running SNIPE as is after our meeting,
I don't think I'm going to tonight.
The prickling in my back is still there.

I went to the pharmacy to pick up the hormones.
Next time, I'll just refill the estrogen and continue using the spyro I have on
reserve.
If the pharmacist mentions anything about refilling only half of my prescription,
I could tell her that I have a stash of those from before coming to Canada and
they're going to expire.
Which is the truth, I guess.

I bought a lipstick and blush.
Maybe that had something to do with my recent facial dysphoria.
Ironically, moments ago, I actually liked how I looked in the preview square
that showed the image of my own webcam.

I bought eggs, becuase I would be eating the last pair today;
and ham, so I could finish the loaf of bread that I'm almost sure has—or soon
will develop—mold.

Did I actually work after coming back?
I haven't touch either the project of Ed's data.

In our meeting I told Louis how I've been struggling, still, with MAGeT.
He made a comment how that's really bad.
He sent an e-mail to Gabriel, and told me that he'd ask for his help to fix
this issue.
_It's not somethig that should take this long_,
_or a thing that I should be spending so much time on_,
or a phrase like that.
He just said that I had better things to spend mi time on.

I moved on to SNIPE,
and how Vlad just sent me those other scripts to look at,
and there were some in MATLAB.

Here they come again, the tears.
Except this time they're stopping midway.
I feel them bloatening my cheeks.

When I said that I hadn't really done anything with the Deep Learning,
he said that there was no problem.
Why am I still feeling like a disappointment?

In the chat with Gabriel of Mallar's lab, I felt like a failure.
Like this stupid girl who doesn't really know what she's doing.

Am I? Do I know what I'm doing, I mean.

The tears finally came out.

### Friday, October 15th, 2021
Today, again, I didn't feel like doing the words.
It was the same familiar feeling of 'why should I even bother?'.

There are some internet issues.

I woke up around 6h, but went right back to sleep.
I'm pretty sure I heard Armando up—in the kitchen, possibly—and going to the
bathroom to shower.

I can't remember what I dreamed, so it might have not been anything important.
I postponed the alarm until a couple of minutes before going to the gym.

When I woke up, two whatsapp notifications appeared when I looked at the time.
They were Alda's.
She called me by my name and asked me if I could please open the door for her.
They were from 8h, almost an hour old.
I panicked and sent her a message to please tell me she had gotten in, somehow.

She did.
Armando let her in.
She was a bit embarrased because she was, in her own words, _pretty baked_.

I went to the gym and didn't reply back.
When I got downstairs,
I signed my name in the sheets continuing the routine of
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
I looked through the small window pane on the door.
There was a man bench pressing inside the gym.
I had gone a couple of minutes earlier,
so I just put my water bottle on the table and browsed my phone until he came out.
He didn't take long.

"Good morning", he said to me as he left.

I went directly to the treadmill and this time I changed the mode so I
wouldn't need to keep grabbing the bars to check my heart rate.
Some places in the internet were saying that it's not healthy.
Maybe that's the reason why I've been having this pain on my lower back.

During my run I heard the noise of a door opening behind me.
I was startled to see the cleaning girl pass on my right.
I felt a little guilty for not wearing my mask,
even though the guy that went before me didn't have his on either.

I finished the 30 minutes of jogging, and came back to shower.
This time I did not wear a sports bra, so my shirt was soaking wet.
I didn't feel any difference.
Maybe it's because my breasts are very small.
They do count as breasts, right?

I went to the PC with a cup of coffee and a bowl of cereal supposedly to start
working.
I didn't do anything productive for the rest of the day.
I should do something in the weekend, even though, on the long run,
it will be actually worse for my productivity for the rest of the week.

Still, I don't want to have another meeting with Louis without anything to
show him.

I stayed on loungewear and a mario t-shirt with my hair up for most of the day.
That's how I looked when I connected to the lab's Friday meeting.
Nothing important was said in it.
It didn't last long, either.
Maybe an hour.

In the morning, when I was sitting naked on the toilet after returning from my
run, I read how Louis replied thanking Gabriel for his help on our chat in Slack.
By the end, even though I did still feel like an idiot,
it wasn't as much as during the beginning of it.

Louis shared with him the repo of my app.
Was he proud of it? of me?
Maybe he noticed how I looked pretty stupid and wanted to save face.
Probably it wasn't that, yet that's going to stay in my mind.

I ate two sandwiches.
One of ham before the meeting, and one of bacon after.

Alda sent me a message an hour ago,
asking me if I wanted to watch a movie tonight.
I said yes without thinking.
She said how she was looking at the times right that moment.
She was talking about going to the movies.
I feared how I didn't want to spend any more money,
and I wouldn't want to waste it on a movie that I wouldn't really want to see.
Neda had just commented during our meeting that she wanted to see the
new James Bond movie,
but it was full.
She had bougth tickets in advance for tomorrow night.

Actually the theater was almost empty tonight.
Alda bought the tickets.

I put on some clothes and am just waiting a couple of minutes before we leave.

### Saturday, October 16th, 2021
I feel so tired.
I am getting nervous again with money, my finances.
I should do a budget, but I am nervous that I'll realize that there is a lot
of stuff where I spend my money that I should not.

Yesterday the internet—the one that I pay—went off for a moment.
The computer automatically connected to the building's internet.
Still, pages wouldn't load.
Moments like that make me feel sure that having Fizz's internet is actually a
good choice.

Last night we went to the movies.
I put on the blue sweater that I recently bought over a bralette and a tank top.
I passed the razor over my chin.
I can't remember if I brushed my teeth.
We talked about going to the dépanneur before the movies,
so I sent a message to Alda telling her I was ready if she wanted to leave a
bit earlier.
By the end, we left at 9h30, just as she had suggested.

We had a shot of amaretto and left.
I took my passport with me in case they would not accept my driver's license
as a valid ID for the vaccine passport.
Several times I felt a cold flash of anxiety,
worrying that I would brush my hand over my back pocket and would not feel
its outline.

I bought a water bottle and a bag of popcorn.
I bought it large with the intention of sharing it with Alda.
By the end, I almost finished all of it myself.
I still did the 16-hour fast.

James Bond died at the end.
I had completely forgotten that the French woman was also on the previous movie.

We returned home and made some cocktails with what we had home.
Orange and grapefruit juices, rhum and vermouth.
We smoked on the balcony and chatted for a bit.
She mentioned again the reference to the tutorship job.
I, again, felt a little bit awkward given that I still struggle to find the
time to actually be productive.
Even then, I considered it later.
She would get a thousand dollars bonus for the referral.
She offered to split it, but it's not just that.
I am spending too much money.
A little extra would come handy.
At the same time, I feel I am lagging behind on my program and that time is
not enough even without it.

I'm hungry.
I ate more than I planned.
First, I made myself a bacon and tomato sandwich.
Then, when I didn't feel satisfied enough, I served myself a bowl of cereal
and ate it while I finished the movie of Daniel Radcliffe where he has a pair
of guns stapled to his hands.
It was pretty stupid, but I enjoyed it.

Now I am tired.
I want to finish this thing and go back to bed.
I don't even feel like reading.
I just want to lie down and close my eyes.
What else could I write about?

I browsed a bit of Instagram.
I put the usual names in the search box, but there was nothing new.
I saw Paty's stories.

When I got up in the afternoon, I had several messages from different people.
Monica, Sonny, even Anahi.

Monica's been going to a physical therapist.
Is she still having issues with her body?
She looks thinner again.
I thought she was getting better.

The first girl to whom I talked in highschool was Veronica.
She talked to me.
I don't remember much of her or that conversation.
She studied medicine.
When I came out, she added me on the new profile.
A couple of months ago I saw some pictures of her.
She's anorexic.
She's much more thin than Monica.
She wasn't like this last year.

I looked at the plane tickets for returning to Canada.
The prices are higher, not by much, but still.
I should buy them soon.
I have the credit card info from my father.
They offered me to use it to buy them.
Still, I feel uneasy.

I thought about asking Louis if it was OK for me to stay for a bit with my family,
but after last meeting that I didn't have any real updates,
I feel that I shouldn't.

Last night Alda mentioned that I shouldn't feel too bad,
that I'm doing OK from what I've told her.
I don't see it, though.
When we were coming home, she said that the next day after the church night,
Vix invited her to hang out, and told her to tell me as well,
as he doesn't have my number.
He was with Aiden.

I told her later that I honestly considered it.
Now, after hearing he would be there, I was glad that I decided not to go.
I made no mention of why, though.

### Sunday, October 17th, 2021
I told myself that I would work this weekend.
Especially now after the embarrasment and shame I felt after my meeting with Louis,
the chat with Gabriel and the lack of work on Friday.

I didn't do much today, nor yesterday.

I did work.
I cleaned the apartment, and worked on Eduardo's data.
It took me most of the day and yet, not much progress was made.
The two adderall pills are still on the pill capsule under the monitor.
Alda asked me about them when we were returning from the movies.

I should take them tomorrow.
Full day of work, I guess.
I scheduled the gym at 9h30.
45 minutes of the treadmill.
After showering, I would be ready to get to work maybe a quarter before 11h.
Should I go to the lab?

I want to.
Why?
It's not like my days are more productive there.
It's pressure to not procrastinate, especially when there is someone else in there.
Tomorrow there's a meeting, though.
The Neuro meeting.
Vlad is going to present some of his work.

Yesterday I was browsing the flights back to Montréal from San Diego.
The prices keep rising.
They're not as expensive as the one I bought going to Mexico City, but still,
they're around 10 dollars more expensive than the first times I checked.
I felt urged to buy it, but maybe I should wait until having the OK from Louis
about returning that late after the holidays.
I will be going a week earlier.
My progress is not as it should be.
I ought to thread carefully.

Today I also ate only a bowl of cereal and a bacon and tomato sandwich.
This time I added a fried egg in there.

The last months I was living in Fuentes Brotantes, those were my favorite meals.
Two sandwiches with bacon and fried eggs and a bowl of ramen soup.
The days were I ate, I mean.
There were some days where I would come home and get straight to bed.
The meal from _le petit café_ was my only food for the day.
Was it on purpose?

That was how I got so thin.
The pictures from Pride and before Las Vegas were the thinnest I've ever been.
I remember well how those were some of the darkest days of my life.
The first hints of self-harming thoughts were surfacing.
Why do I want to go back to that?

Maybe I should go to the lab.

I fear that I'll get another message from Eduardo asking me how I'm doing.
It's taking so long and I can't get results.
Why?
I should get over with all of this.
Am I a failure?
Were this a real job, it is a sure thing that I'd gotten fired by now.

Moments ago I was very close to ordering a cast iron from amazon and a wet
stone for sharpening the knives.
I was browsing videos about baking.
The last time I went to the kitchen,
I noticed how I have around 300 grams of AP flour and maybe a full kg of
bread flour.
I watched some videos about making tortillas or bread.
To cook the flour tortillas, you need a cast iron.
The steel skillet we have does not get hot enough.
I could use the cast iron to cook the chicken, too.
I've been thinking...

I went back and almost bought them.
It'd be 50 dollars.
I should not be spending more money.

Armando sent me a message a couple of hours ago.

"Oye, cara de popo. ¿Que opinas de esta laptop?", were his first messages.
Then there was a link to Best Buy showing a gaming laptop.

Why does he call me that?
It's not the first time that he's used those kind of nicknames.
Honestly, I was pretty annoyed and even considered calling him out on that.
Was I offended?

Doesn't matter.
He'll leave soon.
What's the point?

I keep thinking about the cast iron.
I could cook the tortillas.
I could cook the chicken in there.
I have lots of chicken thighs.
Maybe later.
Not today.
After this month.

First I have to finish the food that I already have.
There are bags of frozen veggies that I can cook with the noodles.
I can bake the chicken, or cut it into pieces and cook it in the pan.
I have a lot of corn tortillas.

I don't need it right now. It can wait, at least this month.

### Monday, October 18th, 2021
Was it hard to sleep last night?
I don't remember much about it, or if/what I dreamed.

I postponed the alarm when it started in the early morning.
I was wearing only my red hoodie and panties under the sheets.
Yesterday they turned on the heater.
The idea of waking up early and going to the lab crossed my mind.
There was no point, as I had scheduled the gym around 9h30.
After finishing and showering, I'd be arriving at the hospital after 11h.
The Neuro meeting would start at 13h
so I'd need to take my ipad with me and use it for Teams.

Maybe tomorrow.

I fell asleep thinking about what food I need to buy and how much will it last
me until the end of the month.

I turned off the last alarm with just enough time to change my hoodie for a
shirt and putting on socks.
I felt tired even before starting the treadmill.
I put on 30 minutes and just jogged as best as I could.
At the end, the screen marked fewer calories than other times.
My shirt was less soaked with sweat as well, but I was just as tired.

What will I tell Dr Perera tomorrow?
What was the reason about scheduling the follow-up appointment?
She wanted to see how the emotional symptoms were developing with the counseling,
if they would improve or should we need to pursue other modes of treatment.
What will I say?

It's not even 21h and I could had sworn it was close to midnight.

I don't know why, but Flore just crossed my mind.
And just now,
as I finished writing that sentence, a tingle of shame zapped through my body.
__Only one date and a couple of days of texting.__

I chatted today with Anahi and with my father.
Anahi started the conversation out of nowhere.
She went today to Isaias' office for her therapy and passed the university.

"Cuando vengas quieres ir a cerrar ciclos?", she asked me.

She told me she's been feeling the urge to go, just to see what it feels like.
I mentioned that I couldn't remember what was the reason that I went recently,
but it felt very strange.

The most recent time was to pick up the envelope with my degree and my
transcript to send by mail.
It was just last year, during the middle of the pandemic.
That wasn't the time that I was thinking about when she mentioned __closure__.

It was another time.
I was already looking completely like me.
I wore a black loose blouse over a pair of jeans.
I remembered looking for Zayra and Rene.
I wanted them to see me all changed.
I wanted them to have the latest updated version of me in their memories.
As if somehow it would completely erase the view of me half-transitioned.
Every single trace of him gone.

I thought about her and me going together.
Maybe walking to Business School, to the top floor.
But that was not ours.

We did go sometimes.
The three of us, I mean.
That place was more Catherine's and mine.

And just like that, I thought of her.
I felt guilty.
This shouldn't concern her.
Except it does.
That was the worst of it all.

There were some pictures in Instagram of Jessica's bachelorette party.
She was wearing a white dress and the bridesmaids are wearing black.
There are a bunch of her friends, the two Paolas and Catherine.

I don't really miss her, do I?
Sometimes I do look her up on Twitter.
It's mostly out of force of habit.
I don't remember the last time I did.
I guess time has passed already.
Right now I am fixated on girls that I chatted with only for a few days and
whom I never saw more than once.

Time has passed indeed.
I don't remember the last time that I thought about the dating apps.
Possibly a couple of days after the church party.
Alda hasn't mentioned anything about that.
It's possible that nothing comes out of it.
We have that event Friday.
I haven't received any update from the Steven Universe t-shirt.
I can wear the other _costume_ if that idea doesn't work.

At today's meeting they joked about the upcoming winter.

"What is the official policy about working remotely from Florida or Mexico?",
Vlad asked.

"There isn't one", Louis replied, smiling.
"I guess at the lab we have a _don't ask; don't tell_ policy.

"Now you just need a house in Mexico."

 Talking with my dad, I mentioned that I would talk with Louis about it before
 buying the flight.
 Before that I need to have some results or something to show him.
 I sent him an e-mail that SNIPE ran fine with the default arguments and library.

Armando told me, too, that I shouldn't pressure myself to publish a lot just now.
I haven't been here for long.
I mentioned Neda and how she had her third paper just recently accepted.

Once again, I felt this pressure in my chest and my throat.
This time there are no tears.

### Tuesday, October 19th, 2021
Last night I tried the meditation app.
It wasn't the first day, I've used it before.
This time it was the longer meditation specifically for sleeping.
It didn't do much, really.

That was the main issue I brought up with Dr Perera today, my lack of sleep.
She recommended some tips about sleep hygiene.
I thought that was going to be it and felt silly about _asking for help_.

She asked me some questions by the phone,
it was a simple questionnaire about depression and anxiety.
From my own expertise,
I realized that most of the symptoms I have were related to anxiety.

_Dark thoughts_, they keep asking.
Do I have them?
I mean, no more than normal.

I can't remember the reason why, but I browsed the page of the contact lenses.
They keep sending me emails about picking up where I left off.
The shopping cart still had the two boxes of contact lenses.
For a moment, I was worried that I had never really bought them.
That was the reason I checked.
The purchase had been made.
I clicked the button to tracking the package and a new page appeared
saying that the package had been delivered.
The white little box was put inside the mailbox.

Today I did not got to the gym.
I found it hard to wake up and get out of bed, but I did.
I showered, shaved, brushed my teeth and put cream on my hair.

I came back to my room, picked the two contact lenses packages and returned
to the bathroom.
The youtube videos were helpfult.
I put on the right lens at the first try.
It was maybe 20 or 30 seconds.
It felt weird, but not really uncomfortable.
It did take a while to start seeing clearly.

With confidance, I tried with the second eye, but it was just like last time.
I kept closing my eyelid.
It slipped through my wet fingers.
It could have been 3 minutes just as much as it could have been 10.

I returned to my desk waiting for the call.

I went to the lab and pretended to work for most of the day.

It smells like burnt eggs.
I think Armando's cooking his dinner.

Sitting at the lab, someone knocked the door.
I wasn't sure if the sounds were real, so I stood still.
Reza went and opened the door.
The woman turned to look at me.

"Hi! Do you remember me?"

I looked at her and smiled without knowing what to say.
The woman who had come the other day to ask about the people in the offices
was the first person that came to my mind.
I kept looking at her without saying anything.

"We took this course..."

"Did we?"

"With Yasser.
I'm Mahdie.
I'm also Reza's wife and now we're also your neighbors."

My smile grew, but I still wasn't sure about what to say.
Later they invited me to eat lunch with them,
but I lied and said I had already eaten.
Not much later, I left.
I wasn't making much progress anyway.

Just turning at the end of the street,
I realized I was very cold and the walk home would be a nightmare.
It wasn't that bad.
I got to metro and bought some vegetables and bread.

I cooked myself a sandwich of a chicken thigh with buffalo sauce.
I wasn't full, so I cooked one of the two ramen soups.
There was some pink in the chicken on its thickest part.
Hopefully I won't get worms again.

I put on the James Bond movie, but didn't finish it.
I don't remember the reason that convinced me of going to the pharmacy to
pick up the prescription.
They didn't call me.
It was probable that it wouldn't be ready.
It was possible that they might not even had gotten it.

They did, though.

The lady asked me if they had called me and I told her the truth.
She looked through the faxes and found mine.
After answering some questions and waiting around 10 minutes,
I was called and paid for the pills.
They're not that expensive.
15 bucks.

I grabbed a packet of off-brand ziploc bags and paid for them.
On the way home, I stopped at the dépanneur and bought myself two cans of cider
and a chocolate bar.
I guess I wasn't that full.

I read the dossier of the medication.
I bought it so I could have it tonight.
There is a sticker on the side of the bottle that warns about not taking them
with alcohol.

"I never learn." I sent the picture to Sonny.

### Wednesday, October 20th, 2021
_Meditation is preparation for death._

This morning I did not go to the gym.
The sleeping pill—and I guess the mixing it with the alcohol—worked wonders.
I did not bring my phone to the bed.
No, I did.
I had it next to my pillow, but I did not look at it after setting the alarm.
I dreamed something.
Maybe, but I can't recall any part of it.
I woke up for the alarm but disabled it.
In a brief moment I decided that I would not be getting up nor going to the lab.

I feel ill, but not really sick.
It might be allergies.
I was cold yesterday.

Stepping out of the hospital I realized that not bringing a real jacket was a
terrible mistake.
The second time I went out, I did put on the winter jacket over the sweater.
That time my glasses fog up from the warm breath that escaped from the upper
gap in my mask.
Maybe I'll end up wearing the contact lenses more often than I had first thought.

Maybe not, though.
I worry a little about the process of putting them on and off.
I don't want to try again because of the fear that it will be a disaster.
I fear that if I avoid it for too long,
eventually it will be even worse when I do need to wear them.

I brewed my coffee in the morning after getting up from bed.
While waiting,
I put the chicken thighs in ziploc bags and returned them to the freezer.

After that, I sat at the computer and pretended to work.
I haven't coded anything in all day.
There was some progress, though.
I figured out how I want to do the cross-validation algorithm.
The MonteCarlo Cross-Validation seems to be the better way to go.
I finally understood how they did it in the MAGeT paper.
It's in paper, as in, noted down in the notebook.
Now I just have to write the code.
At least, now I have the excuse that no jobs are currently running in Niagara.

I don't think I'll be doing anything more today.
After finishing these words,
I'll probably just take another pill and go straight to bed.

Should I go to the lab tomorrow?

Louis' meeting is tomorrow in the afternoon.
I could see him in person, I guess, as he's been going to the lab recently.
On the other hand, do I want to?

I have been very lazy lately.
It's not lazyness, though.
I do feel exhausted and find it difficult to concentrate.
Just writing these three pages of words seems so hard right now.

The SNIPE output is downloading to the local PC.
I have to review them and be able to show them to him if he asks.

He's going to ask, that's why I sent him the email on Monday.
I should ask him about what he thinks related to the checking of MAGeT.
I should have the script ready by noon so I could submit the jobs to be
running as soon as NIAGARA starts accepting jobs again.

I smoked in the afternoon after eating my sandwich.
I broke the fast earlier.
After the coffee finished brewing, I ate the cookies that I brought from the lab.
Someone is cooking in the kitchen and it smells really good.
It might be Alda, because they're chicken tenders in the oven.

Tomorrow I could eat one of the frozen burritos.
No, I should eat the food that is going to spoil soon.
Maybe the wienner sausages with spinach and rice.
That sounds really good, actually.

I got distracted again.
The output files finished downloading.
I viewed a couple, but I'm not entirely sure what I am looking at.

I feel so stupid, like an impostor.
He's going to figure me out.
He's starting to.

I keep grabbing my phone looking for something.
Like if there was some new message or e-mail or something in there.
All of the emails in my mcgill email are sorted into different folders.
That was a waste of time, probably.

I should go to the lab tomorrow.
It's harder to procrastinate in there.
Should I wear the contacts? I could try, I guess.

I was saying, my eyes feel weird.
Tired.
I don't know if it's because of the lenses or the allergy symptoms I had earlier.
I sneezed a lot and had a runny nose.
I took some antihistamines and they did some work,
but I'm still not feeling totally well.

If I'm not feeling that well, I should not go.
I'll stay here.
I don't know.

### Friday, October 22nd, 2021
"I have something to confess to you. Well, not really confess, but I want to come up clean."

And while Alda was sharing with me a deep pain that was afflicting her,
I was too busy inside my own mind,
wondering about the subtle signs that suggested that she knew my own secret.

"I have proof of you repenting."

Vix, next to me, opened his phone and played a video for us to see.
We were sitting inside Brewskey's and at the same time I was sitting inside a
confessionary.
The masculine features and mannerisms were highlighted because of the alcohol.
I could not see anything else.
Fortunately, shortly the camera moved away from me.
Aiden, Lizzy, Karina, we were all drunk.

I was the only one that was called 'bro' that night.

I threw up in the kitchen sink.
I remember turning away from Alda and just started spitting out clear water
while I held my hand up signaling her to give me a moment.
Those were some of the last memories I have from last night.
Not much later after that, I realized that I was way too drunk.

The more time I'd wait, the harder would it be to take out the contact lenses.
I went into the restroom and tried taking them out.
My intentions were to take them off quickly and go back with Alda.
It wasn't easy.
I might have scratched my left eye.

When I returned, Alda was gone.
There was a message from her asking me if everything was alright.
Her messages were messy.
I think it was then when she told me she had thrown up, too.

Yesterday I showered and went to the lab.
I had the office to myself.

As I told Sonny,
almost every week I worry that Louis is going to be disilussioned with me.
The façade is going to come down and he'll realize that I am not worth the
stipend that pays me.
And then, at the meeting, somehow he seems happy and hopeful about my progress.
How can he be so understanding and encouraging?

I think it was in the morning,
when Alda told me that Vix had invited us to go to Hurley's in the evening.
After my meeting with Louis, I took my things and left.
I made a stop at the SAQ before going home.
I bought a bottle of Jack Daniel's apple licquor.

Alda offered to cook some chicken tenders for the both of us.

"I don't know what to eat them with."

She went to take a shower while they cooked.
I had the idea of cooking the noodles.
I could share them with her.
That's what we ate.

I put on some make up.
I liked the lipstick, but the blush was a huge mistake.
It does make a difference applying make up when I can see my face clearly.

I'm excited about going home.

I don't feel the energy to finish these words.
I am tired, but I might have a bad time getting to sleep anyway.
I didn't go to the gym today, either.
It's been two days that I've skipped now.
It will be harder to go next Monday.
I feel hungry right now,
even though I've eaten way more than these past recent days.

I cooked a pot of white rice.
In the morning I cooked the sausages with some spinach.
I had those with the rice and a couple of fried eggs.
This was after having a bite of bread and throwing up in the toilet.
Later, after having a nap,
I had the rest of the rice with another fried egg and two slices of ham.
I feel chubbier, even though I probably look the same.

I should go right now and sign up for the gym.
Maybe not in the weekend, but Monday.
I could go to the gym in the morning and then going to the lab.

I have 28 contacts left.
I guess I could always buy more if I need them.

I had decided not to spend too much money for the rest of the month.
Just last night, I think I spent close to 100 dollars.
Was it worth it?

"All of this almost amkes me want to start dating again."

Nobody paid attention to what I said.
They usually don't.

I need to have more pictures of me.
Maybe at the beach with Sonny.
Monica said that she did want to go to the US.
It would be really fun.

Anahi invited me to go to the university.
That would be fun, too.
For a moment I considered telling her that I had dreamed about us going there
with Catherine.
I don't know why.


### Saturday, October 23rd, 2021
"No te pasa que sueñas con alguien que es amigo,
que no tienes interés amoroso y tienes un sueño romántico con esa persona?"

It's night outside already.
I'm looking out the window as if I am waiting for someone.
It's my house, my parents' house.
I guess this is Tijuana.
Mona enters through the door but it's not the Monica I know.
He is a man with blond, chestnut hair and fair skin.
His house must have been really close,
because I suddenly am aware of why he had left.
He had to tell his parents about coming back here.
He makes a comment about explaining them something.

We're suddenly in my bedroom.
I am lying on my bed and he's to my side.
We're talking about something.
I look at his hands.
His fingernails are reddish.
He extends his arm and I grab his fingers to admire his colors.
Red Oak.
They look so pretty and he's proud of them.
He explains to me he just did them recently.

I feel so comfortable next to him.
My hand is on his side.
There is a sheet inbetween, but I still feel the movement of his hands underneath.
I look his way and can't stop thinking about how much I want him to grab my hand.
Maybe if I leave it there a little more he'll get the hint.
Meanwhile, I keep feeling his fingers.

He starts saying something.
We talk about seeing each other.
He was thinking about why does he necessarily have to wait until the
seventh or the eight for us to see each other again.

"...I mean, I really want to see you. Why do we need to wait?"

"No... I want to be with you, too", I look up to meet his eyes.

He's right next to me, yet I want him to get even closer.
He says something about going dancing.
I wonder about how his lips would feel.

And just like that, I woke up.
As a reflex, I closed my eyes instantly as if that would bring me back to that
temporal reality.
It was gone.
I opened my eyes resigned and just stayed lying there for a moment.

Just hours before, I had replied to her message.
I woke up and saw her message that she was still at the funeral.
She had asked me earlier to send her a message to distract her and explained
that the mother of the engineer whom she actually likes had died.
Her message around midnight said how she wanted to leave,
but his friend was at the chapel and she hadn't said goodbye to him yet.

"Sí te fuiste?",
I sent her before going back to sleep and dreaming she was a boy.

After I woke up, I saw her reply stating she left an hour after that.
So, I quoted her question about romantic dreams and told her about mine.

"I'm so sorry"

"Why?", she replied.

I told her I did not know.
I had dreamed with her before,
like those more usual dreams where I am the guy and we kiss and touch each other.
I did not tell her about those ones, though.
Was I apologizing for that?
Was it because in my dream she was a man and I liked him?

"Pues yo también he tenido dirty rêves contigo!"

I asked her more, but she said she wasn't elaborating more because she was
just waiting for her friend to pick her up.
They were going to go looking for flowers.

I told Sonny about the dream, too.
She was talking about these girls they met and how they invited them to a
queer party.

"Y ¿qué?, ¿te prendió pensar en la Mona?"

Yeah, it actually did.
More and more I get curious about the idea of being with a man.

Later, the conversation with Sonny went back to she hitting on me and
making some flirty comments that first were just uncomfortable and then
pissed me off.
I told her that maybe it wasn't such a good idea about me going with them to
the beach.

I'll be with her at her house for a week.
What will I do if she does something?
She might try to do something and then feel bad when I don't reciprocate.
I should probably look for an airbnb at least.
It will be pretty expensive.

When I sent her those messages,
for a moment I feared that she would agree and I'd have to do all sort of
arrangements.

What am I getting myself into going on this trip?

### Sunday, October 24th, 2021
"Sophi, que ya no quieres ir a Vallarta por culpa de la Sonia?
No le hagas caso, ayer nos pusimos una señora peda y al parecer le gusta
escribir de más cuando está peda...
Pero, vamos, te prometo que le pego si te acosa."

I had some dreams, but nothing interesting.
Last night, after taking the pills I felt so tired it was hard to stand up.
Like I had said to Calli, and then later to Dr Perera,
as soon as I laid my head on the pillow I could not fall asleep.

I didn't do nothing interesting the whole day.
I re-read Monica's messages and started worrying about why she wouldn't have
said anything later.
She was the one that said she had had dreams with me.
Surely, that wasn't it.
I sent her a message asking her how the day was with her new friend.
She replied that it went very well, and had gone out with her friends.

She saw, and liked, the new Dune movie.

I was just wondering about sending a message to Alda asking her if she wanted
to go and see it.
I didn't want to go out tonight, so at the end I decided against it.
Maybe I can send her a message tomorrow.

Do I even want to see it?

I watched a movie that, even after less of half-a-day later,
I don't even remember much about.
Right, it was about two straight women that kissed and then one got married.
I didn't like it, but at least I finished it.

The one before was also about two women, but these were lesbians.
One of them was the girl from arrested development and the other one was Spaniard.
It was weird and not really good.

The other one was about two jewish women. That one I didn't finish.

Maybe I just wanted to see something romantic to satisfy the itch that that
dream left me.

I painted my nails.
Fingers and toes.
Black again.

I thought about using the blue color of those pictures.
I think those might be the oldest pictures that I liked when I took them and
still do.
Most of the pictures of those first couple of years I liked so much when I
took them.
It was the first times that I looked at a picture of me and didn't feel
apathetic to them.
I smiled sincerely and thought I looked fine.
Now, of course, I see them and cringe.

I've been losing some weight lately, but maybe I'm starting to get it back.
This past week I skipped the gym twice.
I've also been feeling very hungry.
I signed my name in the gym sheets again.
This time I reserved earlier spots.
Hopefully, I'll be able to get up tomorrow and actually go.

I cooked one of the chicken thighs and bathed it in buffalo sauce and put that
inside a sandwich.
The ranch and hot sauce are almost finished.
Soon, I will need to buy more food.
The mayo and mustard have close to nothing left, as well.

After finishing I felt pretty hungry still.
I looked into some delivery apps wondering if I ordering something was a good
idea.
I craved something sweet and sugary.
I browsed the pastries and donuts.
I was tempted by a couple of places, but decided against it.
Instead I put on shoes and walked to the dépanneur.
I looked at the cookies and the pastries.
In the end I paid for a box of maple biscuits with the spare change I had
lying around.

I ate half of it.
I feel pretty full.
Maybe it wasn't the best idea.

I thought about going to the lab tomorrow.
Tomorrow there will be a Neuro meeting.
Cassandra sent some papers to read,
we're all going to comment on them.
I think I should read them.
I don't want them to think how much of an idiot I am.

I already had my sleeping pills.
Perhaps I could just wake up tomorrow and read them before the meeting.
I'm starting to feel sleepy and it's not even 20h.

What else could I write about?
Tomorrow I have lots of stuff to work about.
Hopefully the gym gives me energy.

Even now, I feel discouraged to go back to sleep.
I don't want tomorrow to come.
I want to rest.
Why am I so tired?
Out of nowhere I'm starting to feel nervous about tomorrow.

"We will take turns explaining different parts of the papers", Cassandra said.
That didn't happen before.

### Monday, October 25th, 2021
I took my sleeping pills.
I didn't do any coding today and I feel like the whole day was wasted.
I couldn't remember if I had already taken the night pills or not.
Hopefully, I didn't.

I woke up in the middle of the night, I think.
If I did, I went back to sleep until a more reasonable hour.
Maybe 6h; 5h at the earliest.

These sleeping pills really mess me up.
I can't think straight.
The memories are foggy.
I did some stuff in my phone, but I don't remember exactly what.
It wasn't any interesting conversation.
Sonny wouldn't send me a message until later in the day.

I got up and watched the episode of _Y: The Last Man_.
It was fine.
It ended at the precise time that I had to leave for the gym.

This time, I used the elliptical.
Not even 15 minutes later, I left.
The blonde cleaning girl was around the gym.
It wasn't her, honestly, why I decided to leave.
I got very tired and stopped every other 5 minutes.
There was no point continuing.
I looked to grab the paper towel and the spray bottle, but she had them.
She might have seen me, because she came towards me and handed it to me.
I cleaned the machine and left.

There was no point, really, but I showered anyway.
My tootbrush is in a bad shape.
I should replace it soon, even though it's not been three months since I got it.
The conditioner might finish soon, too.
Did I look about those in Amazon?
No, that also happened later.

This is where Sonny sent me a message asking me how I was doing.
Last night I browsed AirBnB looking for a place to stay before the trip to
Vallarta.
I made no mention of it to her.

I read the papers for the meeting.
It went fine.
I made only one small participation.
During the meeting, Cassandra sent me a message on the side asking me if I
ended up contacting Mahsa about the lists.
I lied and said that I had drafted an e-mail.

"I'll send it after the meeting". I did.

"...so, I'm not sure if you can replace me (maybe ask him?!)...",
was her response.

I was cooking pasta when I read that message.
Maybe it had been a mistake to contact her.
Louis would be upset about it.
God, sometimes I can be such an idiot.

I asked Monica's opinion.
She told me to calm down, she read it as just an emphatic question.

I hope she's right.
Mahsa didn't answer my reply.
I told her that I would ask Louis for his opinion.
This time I did draft the e-mail.
I'll send it tomorrow before Calli's appointment.

I know what I should talk with Calli.
I can't continue ignoring it.
I am even aware that me avoiding it means it is important.
I'll start with the meeting this Wednesday about being trans in academia.

I started monologuing—like I tend to do—about how I would start.
I starting telling the empty air that I had to do 100 hours of therapy to get
my license in Mexico.
How those hours were psychoanalysis.
No, I would start by asking how are we supposed to be working.
That's when I'd mention how I got used to the psychodynamic method of just
talking my head out.
Then, the disclaimer would come that by that point I had not come out,
even to myself, so it was basically one hour of negation.

I feel the effect of the pill.
My arms feel tired and my fingers numb.
Fuck, maybe I had taken the pills before.
One extra dosage won't kill me.

I should have a method so this doesn't happen.
I thought about swapping the bottles from my desk after taking them.
If it's morning and the hormones are on the desk, it means I haven't taken them.
If they're there at the night table, on the other hand,
it would mean that I've already swapped the night pills and thus
I'm done for the day.
Yeah, that should work and it's simple enough.
I'm so smart, sometimes.

I'll go to the lab tomorrow.
The Steven Universe t-shirt came in the mail today.
Nobody will get the costume.
As I told Monica, I'll just take a picture and post it on Instagram to get
attention from my gay friends.

I spent an hour or two looking for caring methods and products for my curly hair.
Are those also stuff that I don't really need?
I've been looking myself differently in the mirror.
I like what I see.
Maybe I can spare to spend some money on feeling pretty.

### Tuesday, October 26th, 2021
Last night, after taking the pill I went straight to bed.
Still, I could not sleep.
I kept wondering about what I was going to talk about in my session with Calli.
The last time that I looked at the time, it was around 3h.

The alarm sounded at 8h.
I don't remember what I was dreaming about,
but the sound of the phone grasped me and pulled me back to the real world.
I postponed the alarm for another 10 minutes, but didn't sleep any more.

I grabbed my clean underwear and contact lenses and went to the restroom.
It was empty and the shower curtains were dry.
This time I got before Armando.

Last night I bought some of the stuff that I had in my shopping cart of Amazon.
I went into this rabbit hole learning about how to treat curly hair.
I bought some stuff I do need, like toothpaste and a set of toothbrushes.
But I also got some stuff that I honestly I could go without,
like a hair dryer, hair gel, and some scrunchies and a silk scarf.

The shampoo and conditioner are stuff that I can go without.
And so, I moved them to the 'save for later' page.
The whetstone that I also considered buying is also there.
Just now I started to think how even though I wanted to spend the less amount
of money possible, I'm going to cut it real close to the needed 500 dollars
savings after the month.
5 days left.
I still need to buy food.

Tomorrow, I'll make the shopping list.

The time it took me to shower was even shorter than usual even though I
implemented some of the new hair routine that I researched.
I showered normally.
After finishing, I put the cream on my soaking wet and wrapped the hair
with my used t-shirt.
I had washed my hair before...

The pills are taking effect again.

I had washed my teeth before showering.
So, the first thing I did after stepping out of the tub was to wash the cream
from my hands and give the lenses a try after the moments of drunk panic that
other night.

I had the idea of starting with the left eye,
since that's the one I always struggle with the most.
It was a good idea, I guess.
It wasn't that the left eye is more difficult just because it's the second,
and thus starting with it balanced things a little.

The heat of the washroom and the sweat from my nervousness made things a lot
more difficult than usual.
I couldn't open my eyelids with my fingers.
They kept slipping and my eyes seemed even smaller.
After a couple of tries, I shaved and exited the bathroom.

As soon as I opened the door, I heard Armando's creeked.
I felt a bit guilty, in case that it had taken me a lot of time.
When I enetered my room, the screen of my phone showed that it was 8:45.
It hadn't been that long.
And also, I had another hour before leaving.

I talked about what I wanted.
I mentioned my previous therapists and those dating weeks.
Molly was the setup of everything,
Flore was the bomb that would eventually destroy me,
and Alice was the spark that triggered everything.

After the session, I walked to the lab.
I was alone most of the day.
I did do some work, but nothing significant.
I sent the draft of the e-mail to Louis, but I'm not sure he saw it.
Around lunchtime he was heating some soup in a tupperware just when I exited
the office.
We chatted for a bit and the e-mail was never mentioned.

I told Monica about the night with Alda when she shared with me what had
happened with that guy.
As soon as I mentioned it, I realized how I was actually breaking her trust.
How shitty of me to tell something so personal and private.
Did Monica noticed that, too?

Less than 100 words.
I feel exhausted.
Hopefully, tomorrow will be easier to get up in the morning.

It's like my thought was in my mind and then suddenly it was just gone.
I need to do more work.
No, I'm fine.
Calli asked me to give her guilt,
put it in her hands and leaving it in her consultory after I left when our
session ended.

Tomorrow it's the _Trans in Academia_ event.
I made no mention of it today.
I had just forgotten until this very moment.

### Wednesday, October 27th, 2021
The Tea4T conference for trans and nb people in academia just ended.
It was 2 and a half hours of my life that I won't ever get back.

I told Monica how I think I have some prejudices towards non-binary people.

I had forgotten again about the zoom thing.
It suddenly reappeared in my mind half an hour before its start.

Last night I followed Calli's suggestion about paradoxical sleeping,
so I grabbed my ipad and started viewing Mythical Quest.
All day I've been watching it while I do some work.
When I remembered today's event I was just finishing the special epsode about
the pandemic.
I really liked it.
It almost made me cry.

I logged into the Zoom conference and of course there was issues with Zoom.
First it crashed, so I had to kill the process and re-run Zoom.
After doing that, there were issues with my microphone and camera.
Fortunately I wasn't planning on turning either of them on.

Somehow I felt the need to look at the list of participants.
Most, almost all of them, had their pronouns right next to their name.
Just a handful, at most, were the only ones who didn't have them.
From the 40 something participants, more than thirty used they/them pronouns.

I reviewed the names of the list as if I were to recognize anyone in there.
Curiously, I actually did.
Saren Seeley.
She was also in Seattle for Neurohackademy.
Melvin and her and I.
I guess we're the full trifecta.

I don't really feel like talking about that event.

I woke up around 5h yesterday.
Felt pretty tired by this hour last night and still I could not fall asleep.
Again, it was maybe around 3h or 4h the last time I saw the time.
I postponed the alarm as I resigned that I wouldn't be going to the gym.
I feel like I've written this exact same paragraph before.
Is it a déjà vu or is my life this predictable now?

Cassandra sent me a message through teams in the morning.
Had I contacted Mahsa at all?
She was going to have her meeting with Louis and would like to give him an update.
I saw it two hours later.
I told her I had sent Louis an e-mail yesterday but he didn't reply back.
I forwarded it to her.
Her meeting was going to be 30 minutes after our conversation.
I didn't hear back from her after.

In the afternoon, Mahsa sent me a message, too.
She wanted to know if I had asked Louis.
She started the QC and was seeing how he had some warning images as well.
I told her about Cassandra's meeting and my own tomorrow.
I would let her know as soon as I had any information.

I just took my night pills.

I did some laundry today.
Although I didn't make much progress, I now have the plan of what and how I
need to program.

Did something happen with Cathe... what?
Why did I started to write the name of my ex.
Oh, I feel the effects of the pill again.
Maybe I should take them exactly before bed.
After finishing the last 200 words, I'll do that.

Did something happen with Monica and Sonny?
I feel as if it did but can't really remember.
Monica sent me a message of a picture of Eusebio and Jessica asking me if I
thought they were going to get married at the Valley, in the vineyards.
I told her how I wasn't invited, and honestly it did hurt a little.

I'm starting to feel a little nauseous.
Maybe it would be a good idea to pull back on the dosage.

The hair packages haven't arrived.
They probably will tomorrow.

I made some tomato sauce and cooked eggs with tortillas.
Tomorrow I'll cook pasta with the remaining marinara sauce.
I considered going to the lab tomorrow, but that wouldn't be a good idea.
I need to save some of the lenses and I'll go out this Friday.

As I was cooking Alda came and said something that I didn't quite hear because
of my headphones.
After I asked her to, she repeated herself and said that Karina had told her
they were planning to make some reservations for going out on Friday to some
bars and clubs.
She must have seen my face and interrupted herself that she knew we had the
event of her friend.
We agreed that we could always meet with them after.

Should I wear the Steven Universe costume?
Should I tie my hair up to mimic his hair,
or should I embrace my feminity and go fully cross-gender?
Maybe I can ask Monica or Sonny for their opinion.

### Thursday, October 28th, 2021
I don't want to write the words.
I was going to say that I skipped the gym today, but that's not true.
That was yesterday.
Tomorrow is the other day that I signed up.
Will I go?

Last night I took my pills and the same thing happened again.
Nausea and extreme exhaustation but after lying down, I could not fall asleep.
Even after masturbating, I just stayed there, _resting_, like Calli said.
In the morning, I desactivated the alarm and just stayed in bed for most of
the morning.
I really needed it.

Last night I was OK with the progress I have.
I could tell Louis that the coding is done and I'm waiting for the jobs in
Niagara to finish.
Sure, it would be even better if by our meeting I would actually finish the code.

I brewed a cup of coffee and sat by my desk around 11h.
I worked.
And the code is finished.
Kind of.
I only need to double check that everything is written in a way that it does
what I actually want it to do.

I'm actually proud of some of the stuff I wrote.
There are some lines that are quite elegant.
I wouldn't mind actually submitting a PR to the github repo.
Sure, for that I need to make sure that it in fact does what it should do.

Louis asked me how I've been and I lied like I always do.
I didn't shower.
Hopefully it's not too obvious.
He said that I looked tired.
I took his invitation and actually told him the truth.
As a matter of fact,
I've been having insomnia and my sleeping pills don't seem to be working.

We talked about the situation with Mahsa and the QC lists.
Do I really want to talk about that?
I don't want to talk about anything really.
I still feel full and I'm tired.
In the morning, when I was still on bed under my sheets,
I felt my stomach and remembered that picture of me in a similar position
looking down to the thickness of my body.

I took a picture of me pulling my shirt up.
I am way thinner.
It's not just my imagination.
I sent the picture to Monica.
She agreed and asked me why do I think that is.

Why is it?
it's not the first time that I fast.
I've literally been doing this for more than a year.
Am I bordering again on an eating disorder?

After the meeting with Louis I ordered the pizza from Door Dash.
The delivery was free and on top of that they gave me 50% off.
I picked it up from the lobby.
I'm watching 'The Morning Show'.
I grabbed two slices, big ones, half a bowl of spaghetti and the plate of fries.
I'm actually a little bit worried that it counts as binge eating.

Kory sent me a message earlier today.
I had been remembering about him, as I told him.
He asked me how I've been doing and if I had plans for Halloween.
He also sent me this info of a party in a secret location.
It looked so cool.
That made me think about the costumes.

Tomorrow I'll dress up as Steven.
That's the plan.
Alda sent me a message asking me if we could share the internet again.
She's so frustrated with the internet of the building,
she doesn't mind paying me again.

I felt a little bit guilty about changing the name and password,
but decided against making any kind of explanations.
We talked about that, the pizza that I left for them and the parties.
She asked me if she looked like dexter, so we started taking about the costumes.
I considered sharing with her how I wondered about dressing as a schoolgirl.

I didn't though.
Instead I sent a message to Anahi.

Yesterday—or was it today?—Sonny asked me to buy her the Harry Potter costume.
I told her that I had the cape, but didn't know if L had it or my ex.
L replied back and said it wasn't in my closet.

I told Sonny that if she asked my ex personally, I'd give it to her.
If she really asked her I would pick it up personally.
No, even better, I would ask Monica to pick it up, she would totally do it.

"A huevo lo hago, haha, eso dije antes de leer el _she'd totally do it_."

Why do I want this to happen?

### Sunday, October 31st, 2021
I signed up again to the monthly challenge of this website,
even though I have missed several days this month.
A couple just these past two days.

I started writing in my phone as I was sitting on Vix's couch.
Similarly to how I would take out my phone and type in the notes when I was
very drunk.
I wasn't that drunk, though.

I wore the Steven Universe t-shirt Friday.
That's how I logged in to Teams for the social meeting of the lab.
Nobody saw my shirt.
I put on my contact lenses just after showering.

Did we pre-drink before leaving?
I don't reallly remember.
Maybe I was still disgusted by the alcohol.
I remember serving myself some whiskey in the shot glass and struggling to finish it.
Was it that time?
It must be.

I took some pictures but hated most of them.
My face was how I remember looking after taking my glasses off.
I deleted several before finally settling on one and posting in on Instagram.
I had some attention there.
Paty didn't say anything, though.
Did I expect her to?

We went to Alda's labmate's show.
It was supposed to start at 9h30, with the doors opening half an hour before.
We made a stop at a _dépanneur_ to buy a bottle of water.
A couple of blocks before arriving we realized it was 9h30 already.
I started getting a little nervous that the show would had already started or
that we wouldn't be able to find seats.

We got there around 5 minutes after the supossedly starting time.
There was a line outside.
The doorman kept telling the people that there was an atm machine they could
use if they wanted to drink, because the night was cash-only.

The show didn't start until half an hour later.
Vix's crew were going to go to some house party in Laval.
They offered to pick her up, but there was only one available seat left.
We could order an uber and meet them there.
Alda checked the prices and the one-way trip was around 47 dollars.
We decided to stay.
There was no point.

No, Alda told Vix that if he had taken a car, maybe he could come pick us up.
He said they hadn't arrived there.
When they finally did, it wasn't much later that they decided to bail.
Karina would tell me later that night in spanish how the place was really sketchy.
It was when they tried to sell them a bottle of booze that they just left.

They sent Alda a message about going to Club Unity.
We could meet them there, it was only 20 minutes away walking.
Several times we thought about leaving, but didn't.

There was one blonde girl who would go and help clean and grease the poles
between every dance number.
She was wearing red underwear.
I don't know what was it from her that I liked.
She wasn't the thinnest, nor the most muscular, nor the curviest.
She wasn't the only blonde girl, either.
What was it? Why her?
She never danced.

We left at the very end of the show.
It was past midnight.
Maybe we could still meet them at the club.
Alda called Vix, but she felt him weird.
Karina replied to her telling her she was home, but Alda didn't believe her.
I don't remember now how things happened,
but after considering going home, we turned around and walked towards the club.

When we got there, we saw at the entrance there was a 15 dollar cover fee.
Alda asked the guy if he would let us in for half the price,
since it was already very late.
He said no.

Minutes later we decided that we could pay, and he discouraged us.
There were not serving any alcohol anymore, and they would close in half an hour.
It wasn't worth it, he said.
It wasn't.
We waited for them outside the club.

The vibe was weird.
They looked at us coldly.
Lizzie, Karina, Samantha and Vixen.
They were wearing costumes, too.
The plan was to go back to Vix's house.
Lizzie left with the guy that she met after Brewskey's.
Something happened with Sam, her stuff was at some dude's place,
her phone was going to die.
Vix drove her home.
The detour lasted around an hour.

When we got to his place, I told Alda that I'd be taking my lenses off.
It was around 16 hours since I had put them in.

Karina fell asleep on the couch, as we were watching a horror movie.
I met other two of Vix's roommates.
We walked home.

Yesterday I woke up in the afternoon.
I sent a message to Kory asking him if he had gotten the location of the party.

"Not yet".

I didn't hear from him later.

I smoked with Alda in the afternoon and talked about the plans for later.
She wasn't sure if she wanted to go out.
That made me feel disappointed.
Why did I want to?

I put on the outfit.
The red pleated skirt and the white blouse.
Wearing it tucked in seemed weird to me.
I know it looked sexy, and that's the whole point of the costume.
I remembered Catherine once telling me that the top is supposed to go tucked
in with the skirt.
I don't know what was it exactly,
but the look of the loose shirt hanging just above the end of the skirt,
that I really liked.

I didn't know how to style my hair.
I thought about braiding it, tying it up, wearing a low ponytail.
By the end, I did a half-up.
It was fine.

We stopped at metro to buy some drinks for the house party.
We got there, and waited outside the building for the rest to arrive.
We joked how they would take revenge from the night before and make us wait.
They didn't.

The party was weird.
Several times I didn't know how to approach people or what to say.
Several times I was left alone, stranded in the middle,
not knowing where to look nor whom to talk or listen.

Molly was there and with her was the other Molly.
I tried to ignore her for a while.
I was standing close to the balcony door when I didn't know where to turn.

I made the wrong choice and turned towards her talking with Alda.
She pretended to have just recognized me and said _Hi_.
Maybe she did only then realize who I was.
Could be that I was the only one who pretended to only have just seen her.

Somehow I was left talking with Molly—the other Molly.
Did she asked specifically about me doing Neuroscience?
Maybe Alda said something before I turned.
She did a master in Psychiatry, even though I think there is no such thing.
She worked with memory.
After a couple of minutes, she reminded me of the last girl I went on a date
with when she told me she was going to go with Molly, but it was nice talking
to me.

Not much later, they left.
They were some of the first to leave.

I told Monica several people really like my skirt,
but I only really remember Raven—Martha—complimenting it.
I complimented her costume.
I told her it was my favorite of the night.
I think I said it several times, pathetically.
She kept showing me her butt.
It did look very good with her leotard and tights.

When we were talking she mentioned her recent breakup and her boyfriend
cheating on her.
Like the shitty person I am, the first two thoughts I had was that she
probably was straight, and that she was too drunk.
I kept seeing her friends, second Aiden and the Hamburgler taking care of her.

When they talked about leaving, I wanted to stay.
I went there to say goodbye.
It made no difference.

Aiden was with us.
He made several comments that, were I not sure he sees me as a guy,
I would think he was hitting on me.
I made a comment on how I really liked this girl but she probably was straight.
And maybe she was too drunk, anyway.
Vix made a comment saying that I could had just asked for her number.
He's right.
I want to say that I didn't think it through, but even if I had, and wanted to,
I wouldn't have known how, nor dared.

After that, Aiden returned to the party.
He said something about not wanting to go to that bar.

Lizzie was not drinking.
She's taking a month without alcohol.
I've done that before.
It was right after the Christmas Party of 2018.

"You already knew who he was, right?", asked me Lizzie about Jimmy.

Later, when we walked home,
Alda made some comment that made me think she did feel a little betrayed
that I had talked to him.
She was right, though, he was charming.
His talk made me feel interesting and listened to.
I hated every moment of it.

We played pool at the bar.
Vix later would tell me, after mentioning how a lot of people were hitting on Alda,
that one of them seemed to be into me.
I couldn't be less interested, and yet it felt nice and I wanted to know more.

They kicked Alda out and everyone who was with her.
I was left inside playing pool.
I was way too drunk, so it seemed like I didn't know what I was doing.
Vix told me about the kicking out and I saw one of the waitress putting the
chairs up.
I saw there was still half of the pitcher of sangria there so I drank more
than I should have.

It was raining when we walked back to Vix's.
Either I don't remember much of what happened in there or it wasn't important.

## November, 2021

### Monday, November 1st, 2021
Today is the first day of the monthly challenge and I was getting ready to go
to bed when I realized I had forgotten about these.

Thelma sent me a message a couple of minutes ago.
I remember Abyss was the first person I heard who said he was annoyed by people
chatting you up before telling you what is it that they need.
Rubi was the second.
_Why can't they be direct?
I don't need to be asked how I'm doing or how my life has been.
If you need something just ask for it, we don't need to lose time_.
She asked me if I wasn't living in Tijuana.
Then she made some small talk about my job, what I am doing.

"¿A qué te dedicas?
Siempre pensé que serías escritora."

Was it then when I shared my notebook with corny poems?
No, that was middle school.
I met Thelma in high school.
That first year when I was with Manuel and Alan.
I thought about Medrano telling the Letters' teacher about my skills for writing.
But Medrano wasn't with me that year.
How did he know that teacher?
Was it Manuel?
It doesn't matter.

When I told her that the border was just going to open up,
she replied back that not until January.
I freaked out a little bit.
All the news stated that the November 8th opening is still up.

I didn't sign up for the gym today and still felt a little guilty.

I don't remember what I did in the morning.
I just brewed the coffee and watched the final episode of Y.
I didn't do much work before the Neuro meeting.
I did shower before that.
This time I didn't style my hair.
I just washed it and let it air dry.
It was tied up with a scrunchy for the meeting.

I didn't read the papers today, either.
Louis shared another one following up the one that Reza sent.
I managed to give out a comment about it,
which made me look like I had really read them.
Cassandra is supposed to select the next person to present.
I am nervous that I will be selected.
I don't know why does it scare me.

After the meeting and a little work I ate the leftover sushi.
It was alright.
I enjoyed it but I don't think I would buy it again.
At least not for full price.
Later in the evening I reheated one of the burritos in the oven.
It was really good, much better than the ones heated in the microwave.
The tortilla got burnt a little, but still it was very enjoyable.

I had thought that I would go tomorrow to the MNI and work in the office.
I need to buy some groceries.
Now that I think about it, it might be better if I stay here.
The Amazon package is supposed to arrive tomorrow.
The 150 dollar kindle is going to be in there,
and I don't want to risk it getting stolen.
There's no reason why it should be, but still.
I can predict receiving a call from the courier asking me to open the door.
I rather be here to answer him than tell him I am not in the house and to
leave it there.

I payed the rent, Armando sent the hydro bill.
I asked him if he was going to transfer the account to one of us.
After the meeting I made an account to transfer the contract to myself.
When I asked them, Alda told me that she could be in the contract or not,
she didn't mind any way or the other.
For myself, in the title I put Ms.
When I had to put the data for another person,
the only titles available were Mr. and Mrs.
I joked that they would assume that we were married.

"If you're fine being wives, I just need your SIN and an email"

"Hahah, oh well I guess I'm married now. I'll send you via text."

"What a weird way of saying _I do_", I continued with the joke.

"What a way to ask"

We laughed about it and kept joking about it.
Later, when she sent me her information by sms, her last message said:

"Anything else darling?"

I know it's stupid, but, when I read it, I felt a faint tingling in my stomach.
It's been so long since I felt something similar.
I really am starved for affection, I guess

### Tuesday, November 2nd, 2021
When I was a child, I would count the days until Christmas Eve.
Ever since I can remember, it was the eve that excited me,
not so much Christmas itself.
Sure, the family dinner and the trip to Mexicali were nice, but the best part,
to me, was the excitement and minute counting to midnight.

It wasn't really about the toys, was it?
It was the opening them, finding out if my guesses were accurate, and being
surprised by the results.
After midnight, especially for a young kid,
there was no much time for actually using those new treasures.
Why, then, wouldn't the Christmas mornings have a preferred spot in my memories?
Those would be the times where would I actually get to enjoy to bounty.

By then, though, most of the excitement would have dissipated.

I feel a little bit like that right now.
It's not just with the kindle after setting it up and letting it to the side
in my desk.
It's everything.
I have a salary, not only do I live alone with my own money,
but it's in a different country, far away from home.
Why am I not happy?
I made it.
I got it.
Everything is good and what I have ever wanted.

It's Christmas morning, and instead of playing I'm just sitting here thinking about the next Christmas Eve.

I am sitting in my room in my apartment in Montréal and I keep thinking about
flying and going back home.

I'm not halfway done, and already it's hard to focus and finish this.
A similar thing happened in the morning.
I brewed my coffee before Armando left.
I got out of bed and my eyes felt heavy and tired.
I returned with my cup to the desk and got to work.
All of the tasks of MAGeT have finished.
Now, the next thing was to test with only a single subject.
First with the status command,
as that does everything but actually sent the jobs to the queue system.
There were a couple of bugs, but fixing them turned out to be quite easy.

I got distracted again.
And, again, still not even halfway done.
This month will turn out to be harder than I would have expected.

There is a smell coming from the kitchen.
I'm not sure if I heard the noise of the oven.
Maybe someone is cooking something.
The idea of going to the kitchen and serving me a shot of the apple liquor is
looking my way with a smile.

Earlier today, after I had done some of the work,
I sent a message to Alda asking her if she wouldn't mind if I steal a couple
of eggs from her.
Last night I put down to thaw a chicken thigh and the bag of frozen broccoli.
A rice bowl with chicken and broccoli would have been enough,
but I always crave fried eggs on top of rice.

Alda replied back almost instantly telling me to go ahead and not to worry
about replacing them.
I considered thanking her with a "hun", as a callback to yesterday's joke.
A mixture of both being creepy after relying too much on a joke and the image
of the stereotype of older trans women overusing _hun_ convinced me otherwise.


Drinking a shot of liquor with the sleeping pills and just going to bed right
now seems so appetizing right now.

I should stop spending money on things I don't need.
Tomorrow I'll go to the supermarché and buy only essential groceries to last
me a week, maybe even two.
I don't need to buy alcohol, I already have it.

There are no plans on going out.
We haven't gone to see the Dune movie.
Maybe Alda has forgotten already.

Tomorrow I'll go to the lab.
It is too cold to wear a skirt, but I really want to.
It is so short, though.
Last time that I went out with just a hoodie, I regretted it.
I'm almost sure that a similar thing will happen if I try it tomorrow.

I will go, though.
I will wear the contact lenses, too.
Last night I calculated that I've worn four in the last two weeks.
If I follow the same pattern of use,
they will surely last me at least until travelling to Mexico City,
where I supposedly will take the eye exam and buy more.

Last night, when I planned today's meal, I thought about eating the rice bowl
and then reheating another burrito.
I am eating less than normal.
Is it depression?
Is it anorexia?

I mean, I am going to serve me alcohol.
Maybe I shouldn't discard so easily the idea that there is still deep down
something wrong with me.

### Wednesday, November 3rd, 2021
"En la fiesta estaba una morra que no sé si me estaba tirando _les chiens_ o
nomás estaba peda.
Pero no vuelvo a caer, ya no vuelvo a invitar a salir a nadie de ese grupo."

"¿Qué no las tiradas de onda entre chavas son súper obvias?
Según lo que todo mundo me ha dicho."

"Pero yo soy súper wey.
Como tres veces me dijo que mi falda era sexy.
Me quedé esperando el _se vería mejor en el piso de mi cuarto_.

"Ahora que lo pienso,
literal se levantaba la capa para enseñarme lo bien que se le veía el culo
en el disfraz.

"...la morra literalmente me estaba levantando el culo como baboon.
Creo que la del problema soy yo."

I drank my whiskey shot with the pills last night.
I slept an hour or two before waking up again.
This time I grabbed the kindle and continued reading the book about short
stories of trans women.
The night kept going outside my window until around 3h when I blinked and it
was morning again.

I considered waiting in my bed until Armando had showered.
There were no sounds after 15 minutes, and so I went.
Even though I didn't try to put on my contact lenses until after showering,
I still had a hard time putting them on.
My eyes felt smaller and my eyelids stronger.
After successfully getting them in, I left the bathroom and Armando showered.
We left almost at the same time.

I'm wearing the black pleated skirt that's similar to the red one that I
wore at the Halloween party.
I'm wearing the purple sweater.
The tights weren't enough to protect me from the chill winds.
It never got under 3°, but it was too much.
I don't think I'll wear these skirts again until Mexico.

My hair does look better.
I don't quite get the _breaking the crunch_ part of the gel,
but my curls look more defined and natural than when I style them myself
with my fingers.

When I thought about today's words, I planned to write a small fragment of
myself in the balcony at that party.
I would introduce that guy,
the computer scientist disguised with a lab coat and a checkered shirt with a tie.
I saw him and heard his background and thought about the french computer scientist.
Not much later things got weird and I kept looking inside the party trying to
find a way out of the conversation.
It never occurred to me to do as Molly—the other one—would do to me later:
just lie about his conversation being nice and getting the fuck out of there.

I thought about him after I saw the Facebook notification that he had sent me
friend request—again, like with the french computer scientist, except this
time I wasn't the creepy one.
At first I just ignored it and left it for later.

I was working and actually being productive before something happened to the PC.
The podcast I was listening just came to a sudden stop and,
a couple of seconds later, almost everything closed.
There was an Input/Output error.
I wasn't sure what it meant, but, from what I remembered,
I knew it was a pretty bad thing to happen.
I sent a message to Vlad in Teams,
and then an e-mail to him and Louis about not knowing what to do.
Around 20 minutes later, I took my stuff and left.

The apple whiskey is finished.
I came from the kitchen with the last shot of it.
There was a sad song playing and I felt the familiar faint heaviness inside
my chest.

I don't remember what time it was when I saw his message.
After his _Hello_, he continued talking about science and God.
I didn't read the rest.

I took screenshots and sent them to Alda, later to Monica,
and just recently to Armando.

To neither of them did I say that I replied him back.

"Hello! Yeah, hey, please don't take this personal.
I know people get lots out of religion, if that's the case for you, great!
But, personally, being queer, I have several bad experiences with religious
communities/religion in general,
so I would rather not talk about God(s) or religion.
I hope you understand!"

I read somewhere that it's a feminine trait to write several exclamation marks.
I don't remember exactly what it meant,
but now I wonder if wrote them intentionally or not.

The _God(s)_ part was a subtle, but intentional, _fuck you_.

### Thursday, November 4th, 2021
"Moni, honestly, do you think I'm pretty?

"I mean, really, not like, you know,
how girls between themselves call each other _pretty_ and _beautiful_ as encouragement.
Like, I don't really feel attractive.
I'm not even sure it's just because of the trans stuff and being anxious
about looking too masculine.

"I was telling Armando about Saturday's party and the girl that—I thought—I
was kind of flirting with.
I don't know, I thought Alda, who was also there, perhaps would say different.
That she didn't see anything special or, maybe, that the girl wasn't that
interested.

"And I think _why would she_?...

"I don't know if I've been eating less because of these feelings."

I smoked with Alda on the balcony last night.
When I returned to my bed I could finally cry.

Monica kept telling me all of the ways she wasn't pretty and I was.
The stuff she hated about herself, the unattractiveness of her cousin.
She mentioned that picture with my plaid skirt.

After crying, I signed up again in all three of the dating apps.

The only worse thing than having no matches,
is getting your first match deleted just a few moments after its inception.
It's worse seeing the interest die in front of you than it just never existing
since the beginning.

There must be something wrong with you if there is something that makes anyone
reconsider the idea of meeting you.

"But seriously, tho, there is not an inch in your body that is unattractive."

_I can think of three inches_.

After the deleted match, I kept swiping left in Bumble,
maybe to distract myself, perhaps to ease the sting.
I stopped at a familiar face.
It was the same picture that Flore had put on her newly created Telegram account.

There were other new information in there.
A different second picture.
This time, there was no picture of her in the bikini.
30 seconds later, I put my finger on her face and moved her away.
The potential match counter didn't change.
It would be interesting knowing what goes through her head whenever she sees my profile.
Possibly she wouldn't give me a second thought.
What does it matter?, I guess.

Perhaps it was a bad idea going back, putting myself out there.
I'm not ready to get hurt again,
and, less than 12 hours, I'm not having a great start.

Louis sent an e-mail this morning that he had reset the PC in Viper Pit and
could login without any issue.
It was ready for the admins to be tested.
I logged in myself later and all of the files were there.
Qrater was down, but it could be started without problems.
In any case I made a backup and sent it to my PC here.
I also sent an e-mail to them, as if it were going to make any difference.

"Moni, Sorry por ayer, no sé porque me puse muy sensible",
I wrote a minute ago. "Thank you for being there."

I had the urge to somehow bring up the topic about the dating apps,
how Flore's profile had shown up.
I wanted to tell her that I had discarded her as if it were something to be
proud of; as if somehow that action made any difference at all.

Deleting the profiles again would be a mistake,
but certainly I should limit the amount of time—and thought—that I invest in
them.

Someone from the wellness hub called me an hour ago.
Dr Perera had requested a follow-up appointment.
She was available next Tuesday.
So am I, I realized.

I'll talk with her a day after talking with Calli.
Should I mention this last party to Calli?
I worry that I'll focus only on dating and my sensibility to rejection,
but it's not just that, is it?

Why did I care about Monica's perception of me just until the point that she
started saying good things about me?
I've lost the count of the number of times she's mentioned the feminine
features of my face: _Tú tienes facciones finitas; you know that_.

I remember vividly the moment she assured me that it was obvious my being trans.

What am I looking to get out of those apps?
Is it really dating what I want?
I hated most of the dates I went to months ago.
Do I want to feel attractive? Desired?

I want to feel normal.

"No considero que te hayas puesto sensible.
_Somos niñas_ y esta sociedad es un asco con estándares imposibles de belleza—a
pesar de que existe un boom de inclusión, sigue siendo _shitty_.
Tu reacción, tus pensamientos de inseguridad son válidos."

I keep going back over and over to the apps.
I'm Sisyphus walking up the mountain.

I opened tinder and there are no likes.
It's been less than a day,
but I've also seen the same handful of people over and over.
I might have been _shadowbanned_ as several blogs have posted.

I was supposed to stop thinking about that.
That was the main reason I deleted them,
because I got nothing out and my mental health went into a nosedive.

I am crying right now, maybe it's the second-hand emotion from last night.

In 15 minutes I have my meeting with Louis.

### Friday, November 5th, 2021
"Quiero tomar y tomarme las pastillas y quedar inconsciente un rato...

"Do you think this counts as _dark thoughts_?"

I kept going back again and again to see if there was anything new in the apps.
This morning, when I opened them and was disappointed,
I realized that I had gone back exactly to where I was when I deleted them.

The same group of people kept appearing on Tinder.
I looked online to see if it was normal or there were someone else who had
gone through the same thing.

I tried deleting the app, but even that kept throwing an error.
I found out a customer support link and I sent the description of the issue.

On Bumble, after deleting the flags there were more likes but not that much more.
I won't find anything in there.

A couple of days ago I had thought about sending a message to Vix asking him
if they had any plans.
I didn't.

I sent a message to Alda telling her that we could watch the Dune movie on her
projector.
She hasn't seen it.

Maybe she's busy.
Perhaps she went out with Vix and the crew and they purposefully didn't invite
me.
It wouldn't be the first time.

Vicky didn't accept the request.
It hasnt' been denied either, but still.
Just now I'm starting to think how it feels exactly as the time that I had sent
Flore the Facebook friend request.
Which was similar to when I sent the first message to Molly.
Maybe that's it, that's the reason it feels so wrong and creepy.

"Le di follow request a la cat-lady en Instagram y no sé qué pedo;
o sea, I'm not doing anything creepy or wrong.
We are/were labmates, I met her in person.
No sé por qué me siento como ¿_guilty_?"

I did it—sending the follow request to Victoria—after talking with Armando.
Why does it feel wrong?

Sometimes talking with Armando,
I feel like some days when I talked to Diego and Said.
Like I was _one of the boys_.
It felt dirty, and wrong, and dysphoria-inducing.

Of course no girl would be attracted to me.

Sonny is attracted to me.
But she doesn't identify as a girl, does she?
Monica said I was attractive.
But she's not attracted to girls, is she?
Cris told Sonny I was attractive.
I don't remember exactly if it was that she liked being liked by a girl,
or if I was the _first girl she liked_...
What reason is there to discount her, too?

I don't remember how it was that I started or why,
but I sent Paty a message in Instagram.
It was something casual and playful.
I offered her to raise some money to buy her a table to put her TV on.
She replied later, but kept the conversation going.
I playfully flirted once, but I stopped.
She didn't give out any signs that it annoyed her, but she also didn't engage with it.
Maybe that's it how it happens, how you know where to stop without getting things weird.

After I replied to her last messages, she hasn't said anything back.
Her, Alda, Vicky; what is it today that nobody replies?

Why does it bother me so much?

I did not do anything productive today.
The minctools stopped working on my PC after the last system upgrade.
For a moment I tried fixing it.
It was fruitless, so I stopped.

I logged into the Teams meeting.
Louis wasn't in there, nor Vlad,
nor any of those who usually keep the conversation going.
I muted myself and was distracted the whole hour.

I keep thinking about Monday's meeting with Calli.
I guess I have lots of things to talk about.
Am I seeing any changes, really?
Is this really working?

Today's dinner was a chicken sandwich.
It was satisfying.
Nonetheless, I walked to the _dépanneur_ and bought a jar of mayo,
chips and two ciders.

I could swear I saw the mayonnaise was around 3 or 4 CAD.
The two ciders were 6.
The total was 19 dollars.

I was at the parking lot when I decided to turn back and ask.
There must have been something wrong.
Was the guy trying to scam me?
I didn't get a receipt either.

I asked him if the order was correct and to double check the price of the mayo.
It was 7 dollars. Another 7 of the chips.
I was wrong.
I apologized and left.

I am drinking the second can of cider.
This time I will take the pills.

Hopefully I will have a good cry before falling asleep.

### Saturday, November 6th, 2021
_I dreamed about you again, this time you were you, not a male version of you_.
I considered sending it Monica moments after waking up.
I didn't.

I untied my hair and went out to the kitchen for something,
probably a glass of water for my pills.
Armando was there.
No, Armando was at the door and I didn't go to the kitchen, but to the restroom.
Harraj was at the door, too.
He said _hi_.
I didn't understand him, but got his intentions from the context.

"¿Tú ves Narcos México?",
says the message that just lightened up the screen of my phone.

I'll answer Armando after I finish with these words.
He doesn't reply back to me instantly anyway.
Alda did reply back.
I don't remember if it was late at night or early in the morning.
Her messages were there when I grabbed my phone while I was still in bed.
I didn't say anything back.

Vicky didn't accept the request.
I haven't checked to see if she denied it.
It's not that I don't care, I do want to know, but _what is the point?_

I created a new account of Tinder.
The same thing happened.
Zero likes and the same handful of people appearing after closing the app.

I thought about openning up the app and using it in Mexico.
Maybe Puerto Vallarta, surely in Tijuana.
That might be the main reason why I kept going back.
I deleted it without erasing the account another time.

I've deleted Hinge and Bumble, too.

In hinge I only got one like.
No, it was one from a woman, but I had several from guys.
The likes in Bumble increased after I removed the queer and trans flags.
Still, I got that yellow page that tells you there are no more available people
to swipe that matches your preferences.

There is no point. Do I even want to go out with anyone?

Would I had been interested still in _Raven_ had she not shown me any little
bit of attention?

"Ahí compraste el otro", the phone turned on again.

This time it's Sonny.
She asked me my opinion on a laptop sleeve that resembled an old
leather-bounded book.

"It's something that I'd buy".

One of the phones I had, I kept it with a case just like that.
My MacBook, on the other hand, had a skin of wood.
I looked up something similar and sent it to her.
That's probably what she's referring to.

I keep craving chocolate, something sweet.

Last night I went to _dépanneur_ and bought stuff, but nothing sweet.
I ate the bag of chips and the two cans of cider.
I do want alcohol, too.
I don't feel that same heaviness in my chest, but I still wish I could cry.

I had thought about telling Anahi about that idea that came to my head
about inviting Catherine to our day at the university.
_Have some closure_, was the words she used.
Why would she want to share that with me and not with her?
Maybe she's thinking about going twice?
Am I the one who wants Catherine there?
It is weird thinking about going back to those place without her.

I saw her pictures the other day.
Not from those years, but recent ones.
Pictures she herself posted on her Instagram.

I still don't want her in my life.
I really don't care how she's doing.
I have no interest in whether she has finished her associate's degree or if
she's moved on to a 4-year degree; whether she's working now with animals or
if she's still at the Carl's Jr; or if she's left her parents' house.

I, honestly, don't want to see the rest of the gang, either.

I did want to see Paola.
I have thought about it several times.
Why? What do I want to tell her?

What do I want her to tell me?

I ate twice today.
I went to the kitchen and made myself some eggs with tomatoes and tortillas.
I used only two, because I knew that I wouldn't be able to fast for the rest of the day.
A couple of hours ago I cooked the chicken thigh I had left thawing in the fridge with a bowl of rice.

Am I still hungry?
No, I just want to eat.
I crave the chocolate, but that's not it either.
Yesterday, when I went to the _dépanneur_ I also wasn't hungry.

I just want to feel something.

### Sunday, November 7th, 2021
"I think my tinder account is broken.
How am I supposed to find love now?"

I tried to delete the tinder account again.
The same error message stating that there was a technical problem and maybe
I could try again later appeared on screen.
Waiting a couple of hours didn't change anything.

I woke up _earlier_ today.
I was dreaming something,
but right now I couldn't really say anything about it's contents.

I do remember something.
There was a restroom and I tried to go in there.
I pulled down my underwear and started peeing, but the urge was still there.
It didn't matter how much I was peeing, the need to go stayed the same.

I woke up in a panic and immediately put my hand down my pants to sense their
dryness.
They were.
I got up and went to the real restroom in the real word to pee in a real toilet.

The second time I woke up, the phone said it was 8h.
I heard noises from the kitchen and thought it was Armando.
I decided that it was a good time to get up and tire myself for an earlier night.

I went to the kitchen to brew my cup of coffee and Alda was in there.
She apologized for the noise and I told her how they don't really bother me.

"Either I am already awake,
or I am still asleep and I don't really notice them."

I showered and cleaned the apartment.
This time I didn't put on any gel or cream and instead I tied it down in a
french braid.
It looked different.
It's tighter and cleaner.
The three final locks of hair were even in size.
Even the top of the head looked really nice.

This is the first time that I don't have any hair on my forehead and I don't feel self-conscious about it.

I deleted tinder from my phone but left the account in there.
There's no point in deleting it anyway, as I suspect it's not shown to any people.
I kept swiping in Bumble, but I don't see the point.
I removed the flags or mentions of my trans history so the likes I get are
insincere.

I deleted Hinge as well.

I downloaded Her.
This app supposedly made for women.
I don't know what was it, but in there I put my gender identity as _trans woman_
I put on a "Trans Pride" sticker and the trans flag emoticon in my bio.
I hadn't even finished my profile when I already had the first like.

When I finished uploading the pictures and adding more information I had
another one.
None of them were really my type, but I was surprised.

To them, I was attractive.
It didn't matter that I was trans, __openly__ trans.
Minas kept telling me I was pretty even after I told her I was trans.
She looked at me and said _of course_ under her breath—just like Calli did
during our first session.

Calli already knew from the referral.
Did Minas know from my pictures?
That's not the point.

"Can I hug you? Oh, you smell really nice", she said at the end of our date.

"Oh, Sofia smells really good", said Brenda after hugging me when we met in
Guadalajara in a tone that suggested she wasn't really expecting it.

I had two matches in Her and around other 7 likes.
Sure, one of the girls didn't really reply to my message, but still.

When I sent it, at first a red exclamation mark appeared next to it warning
me that it was not delivered.
A flashback to that other girl days ago in Bumble came to me.
A similar dread to the one when I realized that Flore had closed her profile.
I quickly changed Wi-Fi networks and the message went through.

She didn't reply.
Maybe tomorrow she won't be there.
I don't remember her name.
Perhaps that's the way to go,
don't expect anything at all and that way I won't be disappointed.

It's not even 20h and I am starting to feel tired.

I went outside to read, but got busy on my phone.
I browsed Instagram and stayed at the profile of the non-binary tattoo artist
in Mexico City.
I looked at some ideas for tattoos.
I could send him a direct message in Instagram to set up a consultation,
maybe ask him for a personalized design.

Talking to Sonny, I realized that it's a no-go.
I will be in Mexico City just a week before going to the beach.
Getting a tattoo at that time would be a horrible idea.

I considered just asking for the design and looking someone up in Tijuana.
Karla Murrieta is an apprentice.
Perhaps she would know someone.
All the people linked to her studio were cishet-looking guys.
I wouldn't want to get a trans-styled tattoo made by someone like that.

### Monday, November 8th, 2021
"Es raro, o sea, toda mi vida recuerdo sentirme como alienada;
que habia algo _mal_ en mi, pero no sabía qué.
Me acuerdo que no me gustaba ensuciarme ni jugar rudo o ese tipo de cosas.
En el kinder y la primaria no me sentía a gusto con los niños,
pero tampoco en los grupos de niñas.
Siempre estuvo esa sensación, pero no sabia ponerle nombre.
Y, pues ustedes nunca fueron de _no, eso es de ninas_.
Yo tampoco nunca he tenido como gustos muy femeninos de todas formas.
Era más algo propio;
siempre tuve la necesidad de cumplir lo que se esperaba de mí.
Por eso era de dieces en la escuela.
La idea de que ustedes o los profesores se decepcionaran de mi era horrible.

"...pero el baño de hombres estaba cerrado.
Me decías que entrara al de ninas.
Yo estaba llorando, porque quería ir al baño,
pero _no podía_ entrar a ese porque era de niñas y yo no era una niña.
Tú y Felipe me querían convencer que entrara, no pasaría nada.
Yo lloraba aún más porque no me entendían.

"Nunca me gustaron las fotos ni verme en el espejo.
Cortarme el cabello tambien era algo que no entendia por qué lo hacía la gente
cuando nadie los obligaba.
Cuando estaba en la primaria habia una serie.
Creo, no sé de dónde era, ¿de Colombia? por allá.
Salia un niño con el cabello largo.
Lo veia y me sentía fascinada por el.
Lo veía y no sabía con seguridad si era niño o niña.
Yo quería eso.

"Entonces el semestre que dejé de ir a terapia me empecé a acordar de todos
esos eventos y sueños y deseos.
Les empecé a dar forma.
No me quedo de otra que afrontarlos;
ir en contra de todo lo que se esperaba de mí.

"Yo ya sabía de mí cuando me fui a España.
Allá, la primera mitad pensaba en cómo les iba a decir a ustedes.
La segunda mitad, no sé qué paso.
Como que me dió pánico y di un giro de 180 grados.
Me deprimí y bajŕ un montón de peso.
Cuando volví, le di la espalda a Catherine que era con quien había explorado
todo esto.
Volví a salir con Mónica y, por unos meses al menos,
fue como _volver a la normalidad_.

"Inconscientemente me dejé crecer el cabello otra vez.
Meses despues, en el hospital, un par de veces me vieron como mujer.
Me tuve que salir al estacionamiento a vomitar.
Fue cuando volví a terapia y me recetaron antidepresivos la primera vez."

I put on Her a 'Trans Pride' sticker and the transgender flag on my Bio.
I've matched with a handful of different people.
I sent a message to half of them.

Nobody has replied back.
I don't think any of them will.

I woke up at the first alarm but postponed it.
I cancelled the second one before it could start.
I waited until Armando showered before I got the bathroom.
I did my hair and dried it with the blow-drier.

I wore today the blazer I really like.
My contacts went in without much issue.
The left one fell a couple of times, but the right one was not a hassle.

The day wasn't as productive as it could have been, but I still made some progress.
Tomorrow morning I should send a message to Gabriel.
No, maybe I should just change the labels of one subject and just run that one.
Change the labels of all the subjects in a new directory and only run one subject.
Yeah, that would be better.

Chatting with Armando I asked him to go to Thomson House for a beer.
I was surprised that he actually agreed.
He offered to invite Alda as well.
She had her French classes.
She's in them just now.
I offered to go with her to some pub after.
Armando was not up to staying too late today, so Alda proposed to postpone it.

I made comment nonchalantly that I have been planning to go to this lesbian bar,
maybe I could go by myself today.

When Alda asked for the name of it and I sent the picture,
I realized it was close for today and tomorrow.

With Calli, I spoke about the Halloween party; Molly, Aiden, Martha.
I spoke about the trans in academia meeting and my recent feelings of dysphoria.

I bought a bottle of wine and a bag of chips.
The bottle is half empty.
Alda offered to roll me a joint.
I hope her offer still stands when she gets back.

### Tuesday, November 9th, 2021
"Moni, I know you probably are asleep and won't see this message until the
morning—part of me hopes that—, but
I thought about sending a message to my friend asking her if something
happened in DC.
Do you think it's a good idea?

"I don't know if I'd dare tomorrow morning,
but deep down I wanna know if something happened that night."

"Why?", she replied to me almost instantly.

Why, indeed?

I thought that wasn't anything important.
_It was most probably just a dream, flashes of my own imagination; all in my head_.
That's what I kept telling myself until I just forgot.

Did I tell Monica about it before or after Alda told me about Jimmy?

I wish I could see Calli sooner, now.

At least I could tell Alda.
Maybe one night when we go out to smoke or drink.
Perhaps after we go to that NDDQ bar.
This time I can be the one to give her the shots and just blurt out I have
something to confess to her.

Last night, Alda came to the balcony after her French class.
She brought the joint that she had offered me earlier.
It was just for me.

I smoked it all.
It was smoother, but also stronger.
I offered her some wine, but she declined.
She would have an early shift this morning.
I had it instead.

I talked with my mom.
I told her a bunch of stuff about L, and my own past.

With Monica I talked about Aliza.
Is it really something that is bothering that much?
What does it matter if it really happened?
Do I feel abused?

I mean, it wasn't rape.
Not really.
At most it was just a violation of my space,
but what if I was the one who started it?

What if I was the one who actually abused her own trust?

I should let the thought die.

I went outside and sat for a while in my spot.
I don't remember what exactly I did there.
Just sat there, on the cold, feeling what I don't usually allow myself to feel.

Close to 50 people liked my profile.
The same profile with a trans flag.
The profile that states 'Trans Pride'.
Almost 50 people saw my pictures and liked me,
__despite__ the fact that I am not cisgender.

Why do I still feel so empty?

Calli is right, it has to do more with how I see my own body, my own self.
I hate it.
Even though it's slimmer now, even though it is more conventionally attractive,
I still hate it.
Monica stated all the things she hates about her own body and,
for once in all these years that I've known her,
there are more things that I prefer about my own body compared to hers.
I like my legs better, I prefer my breasts, my smaller hips, and my arms.

"I would literally give my left arm to have had the opportunity of
starting blockers when I was 14 years old", I told my mum yesterday.

I would give everything I own to have a womb.
I don't care if I were to have the most painful monthly pains,
or if it were ridden with cysts.

Last night I kept chatting with Paty.
Somehow we got to the topic about the messages I sent her on Whatsapp,
_something about nudes_.

That day she saw her girlfriend and she had to delete the conversation.
Later she would forget about it.

"Yo no la iba a ver", she started.
"De hecho por eso te estaba tirando el pedo...

"Sí me acordé en la noche, pero como me quedé igual con ella fue como de
_no mames, se va a ver bien raro; mejor otro día, mañana_,
pero luego se me fue otro día y pasaron como dos meses, ¿creo, no?"

When I heard her audio, the phone slipped through my fingers and hit my face.
A call was made when I picked it up again.
I apologized and we kept talking about it.
She asked me about my going outs, my job, my life in general.

"I can't read you", told me Minas.
I know now what she meant.

The first girl I sent a message through that app just replied back.

Yesterday, Cake—Clemence—, also replied after I answered the app's question.
The conversation died again later.

Is it about me or them?

Paty was just telling me how she forgets about things.

Vicky never accepted the request—but she also hasn't denied it either.

Molly never sent me a message that Sunday.

Flore deleted Telegram altogether.

I told Sonny that I would tell her about Aliza.
Why am I doing this?

### Wednesday, November 10th, 2021
"Será de _dejé de estar triste y ahora estoy horny ...y triste_."

Ironically, I was misgendered today when I went to pick up the antidepressants.
It hurts.
I guess it is still true how that small and insignificant
moment can mess up with my whole day.

I made the call later today and I will return tomorrow to pick up the estrogen.

Is it because of that how I am feeling right now?

Am I jealous of Monica and her last date?
Did the chat with Anahi about her crush have something to do as well?

The number of people that have liked my profile is now in the low 60s.

There are no new matches.
Nobody else has continued the conversation either.
I don't think any of them will.
It didn't bother me before,
but now the potential rejection after I like someone's profile stings me.

I had to stop.
The phone's battery is red and alarming,
I don't think I'll charge it until I go to bed in a couple of minutes.

I just took the last sleeping pill I'll take in the foreseable future.

Tomorrow morning I'll start with escitalopram.
The claim is submitted.
I won't get the refund until at least a week from now.

The prepaid card arrived in the mail.
There was no second letter with the PIN.
When I tried to add more funds to it, the website said that I didn't have any cards.
Hopefully it is just a bug that will get fixed on its own in the next couple of days.
I don't want to have to call the phone line to inquire about it.

I did some laundry today.
The internet was down, so I showered and went to the pharmacy.
I bought a kilo of rice and a dozen eggs.
Today I ate one frozen burrito and a BLT sandwich.

At the pharmacy, I waited where I usually wait, but the lady there ignored me.
It made me doubt that all these times I was being received where I shouldn't had been.
I moved to the other line and waited my turn.

The cashier there couldn't find my account.
She asked for an id.
It was surely the issue with my two last names.
I don't remember exactly when it was that she called me _sir_.
She just went into the counter to grab something, or check something.
Her instructions ended with _sir_.
I didn't have time to react before she corrected herself with a _ma'am_.
I'm not even sure if she apologized, before that.

I read how this is supposedly the better way to do that sort of stuff.
Don't bring too much attention to it, apologize, correct yourself, and move on.
It still hurt, though.
Even now, it hurts.

I thought about sending another message to the girl in the app who had offered to meet.
Maybe I said something wrong.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Perhaps... who knows?

It was two days before that other girl replied.
All the rest of the messages are ignored.
Same thing as always.

Anahí told me how Lizeth reacted to Catherine's story in Instagram.
When she sent me the screenshot, I saw Catherine and her mom on her screen.
Anahí was going to be Catherine's plus one,
but she _has something more important to do_.

I have been chatting with Paty.
She keeps asking me about my life.
Now it's not just how were my nights out,
the last question she made was when and where do I eat.

When Monica told me about her date yesterday she talked about how she really
liked him now.
She mentioned that he didn't have a girlfriend.
It was a call-out to Rodrigo, Marcos and her Dr friend from dance class.

"Yo no soy nadie para juzgar", I told her, "que ahí yo tambien andaba de
volada con mi _crush_ con novia."

I grabbed my phone moments ago to see if Paty
had replied to the last message I sent her.
There was a notification in Instagram, but it wasn't on the usual place.
I opened the middle button and Vicky's image was at the top.
She started following me.
I put my finger on her face, and her pictures came up.
It wouldn't make sense that she'd follow me without accepting the request
yet I still had to check.

I feel... I feel absolutely nothing.
I wasn't expecting to get excited of the idea,
but there's not even a slight relief that I wasn't creeping.

I thought sending a message to Monica just to tell her,
but that idea does sound like a bit too much.

### Thursday, November 11th, 2021
For a moment, while I was walking to the restroom, I was worried that I had
forgotten about doing my words yesterday.

Years ago, when I was in high school,
I remember going to a spot behind the labs and sitting with my MacBook to
write these.
That was more than 10 years ago.

This is the first time that I am writing them on this computer, in this office.
I have around half an hour before the time we agreed to go to Thomson House.
I put on a skirt and the blazer I like.
I even put on some make-up, too.
I don't really know why.
It's not like I expect to meet anyone besides my roommates.

Last night, I opened up Instagram and went into the search bar.
After the thing with V---I don't know why it feels so strange to type her name
in here, it's not like anyone is behind me---got cleared out,
there was no point in looking at her profile.

Lately, I've been having no interest in seeing Molly's profile either.
And with how I've been talking with Paty I don't have to search her profile
either.

So, there was only one name left that I have looked for before.

Except that her name was not in the recent searches.
I put on the first letters, and nothing familiar came up.

I felt a coldness inside my chest.
The memory of me sitting outside in a state of not-fully-consciousness
and looking for her, and seeing that there was nothing new came rushing to me.
There is this very faint flash of thought,
it crossing my mind and dismissing it:
_Nobody really looks at all the names of the people who see their stories_.

I guess she does because, apparently, she blocked me.
Just after clearing my conscience about feeling creepy and stalker-ish,
this comes up.

And the worst of all is that I don't have any excuse.

I wanted to tell somebody but didn't mention anything to Monica.

Sonny is out of the question.

"No eres una _creep_ por nada.
Yo te diré cuando te pases", told me Monica last night.
I think that was before this last development.

Today, I told half of the story to Paty.
Later, in the afternoon, I shared the complete version to Armando,
who also knows the context.

I had my meeting today with Louis.
This time it wasn't like other times when it was a full 180 degrees change
from the mood of how I started it, but it wasn't the opposite, either.
It was nothing special.
I had a better idea of what I need to do---and kind of how to do it---,
but I worry that it will be hard to actually get to do it.

Let's see how these new pills make me feel.

Lexapro, escitalopram.
Supposedly I shouldn't mix them with alcohol.
I was reading how it's neither that I will get sleepy,
nor that I'll get more drunk.
Instead, the secondary effects of drowsiness and dizziness might get intensified.

I took the first pill this morning with my hormones.
I did feel dizzy.
And I did have some nausea the whole day.

Another effect is anorexia.
Instead, I've been feeling more hungry than normal.
I guess I will end up ordering some food.

I've been chatting more with Paty.
I started the conversation today to tell her about the thing with Flore.
Hopefully we just get closer as friends and nothing weird or awkward develops.

She posted a fragment of our conversation on Instagram, as one of her stories.

I had just sent her a picture of me at my desk.
She replied with a video of herself with the caption explaining that the
background noises were her boss.
I made a comment about how she looked very excited to be there.
She mentioned how she doesn't like him.

"Renuncia y vente a Las Canadas. Yo nos mantengo."

She posted that message with a caption to her story:

_Se va a Canada._

I had thought about asking to see her when I'll be in Mexico.
I probably shouldn't.

I won't have much time there, anyway.
I keep thinking about all the stuff I want to do,
or the people I want to meet with.
Hopefully, I'll get to do at least half of the stuff I want to.

Armando just sent me a message telling me where to meet.
I guess it's time to pack my stuff and go.

I know I shouldn't, but I really need a drink.

### Friday, November 12th, 2021
"Let's do it!
Sorry I'm horrible at answering,
I answer either immediately or take forever!"

I had the idea of wearing the black skirt and the white shirt on top.
I took some pictures, but wasn't very convinced of the outfits.
I sent them to Monica asking for her opinion and she discarded them entirely.
Chatting with her, I remembered the red sweater that I had on that picture that
I sent Vicky for the NIST Lab website.

I showered in the morning.
Actually I slept very well with the joint that I smoked with Alda.

After finishing the words yesterday,
I met with Armando outside his lab and we walked together to Thomson house
where we met with Alda.
We went inside this time.
We had a pitcher of sangria and dinner.
We chatted and I actually had a good time.

I had told Armando before about Flore blocking me on Instagram.
Right there at the table I shared the story with Alda, too.
The moment I got to when her name didn't appear anymore on the recent searches
her eyes widened with the realization of what would come later.
Her reaction was very similar to Paty's.
It seemed a bit to extreme to outright block me.

Later, when she stepped to go to the restroom,
I told Armando in Spanish the missing part of the story about me sending her
the Facebook request after the first date.

I didn't, and probably won't, tell anything about it to Monica.
She will be quick to judge me, and I do that easily enough myself.

I thought I was almost done with the words. They're not even halfway done.

I've been feeling dizzy and nauseous.
Probably I shouldn't drink too much tonight either.

We were getting our table when Alda mentioned how, as a matter of fact,
she was just talking to her friend from her lab about me.
Her friend was telling her about going to some gay bars today.
She said how I was just talking about that the other day.
Maybe we could all go together.

Her friends first suggestion was Notre-dame des Quilles—the one I mentioned
to her and Armando.

This morning, when I was getting my coffee,
she told me that her friend was saying about meeting her at her place and then
going from there.

I tried some outfits, but went back to a hoodie and my pj shorts.
I just took a picture to reply to the image of _Palenque_ that Sonny just sent.
I have some bags under my eyes and my hair is a mess.

What if Kate ends up also being disappointed with me tomorrow?

Probably she won't even reply to my last message in Whatsapp and the date
won't even happen, like with Molly's.

When I was telling them how none of the girls of the app were replying to my
messages, Alda commented that she usually doesn't care and sends the people
two or three last messages.

I joked how I had been following Armando's bad advice,
so now I would follow hers.

This morning I got a message from another of the first girls I matched with.
I looked at her pictures again.
I remember seeing the match and considering telling her how excited I
was when I saw she liked me back.
I realized it wasn't a good look for me,
so instead I asked her about her dog.
After several days, she replied back with an excited _yes_
and asked me if I speak Spanish.
There hasn't been a reply from my answer.

I sent the other message in the afternoon.
_Something direct, take the initiative._
I asked her if she had plans tomorrow and whether she'd like to grab lunch.
My expectations were that it would get ignored,
but at least I would have tried.

Instead, she replied back almost immediately.
She gave me her phone number.

It's from France. Of course it is.

I continued the conversation on Whatsapp.
She saw it, but didn't reply.

_Were she not interested she wouldn't have given me her phone_,
I had to reassure myself.

_Will I see you again?_
_Well, I hope so!_

Tomorrow I'll send her another message in the morning asking her if she wants
to raincheck because of the rain.
I could offer her to come to the apartment, but that might be too much.

A bit ago, I asked Alda about what time did she want to leave.
She answered that around 20h, but it was going to rain again.

"Raincheck?", she asked defeated.

I felt disappointed, but not entirely.

I double-checked the weather app and saw that it was supposed to stay clear
for the rest of the night.

The plan is back on.

### Saturday, November 13th, 2021
"What's your name?...
I'm Meghan.
Ok, Sofia; I'll be going to the restroom.
You're very pretty."

"What about yours? Are they regular?"

"Oh no, uh, I don't get them at all."

I am back from the date with Kate.
She seemed interested from the get go.
She was the one who sent the first message;
she agreed very quickly to going out.
The weather didn't discourage her.
Even though she took a while to reply back to my first message,
she was always cheerful and into the conversation.

The date kept going—just like Flore's—after the meal.
The conversation was flowing.
We laughed.
I had a good time and, from her body language,
I sensed that she was having one, too.

She mentioned going home and looked for the closest metro station.
When we got there, she was surprised that I would be walking back home.

Moments before she had made a comment that she couldn't google me
because she didn't have my last name.
Maybe, when I would give her my Instagram, she could look me up.
After she made the too-familiar speech about having a good time
and letting her know if I wanted to do it again, I offered it to her.

"Do you want my Instagram so you can stalk me?"

"Oh, yeah! Of course! You're thinking of me; I can look you up on the train."

"Always."

Walking home, I got a message from Alda.
I don't remember which one was first,
her list about last night's expenses or her asking me about my date.
I reviewed all the day in my mind before replying.

I woke up at 8h even though I had slept less than 4 hours.
I told Armando about the club last night.
I showered and went on my way.
I got early to the metro station and decided to wait inside.

I got a message from her:

"Attend, t'es arrivée?
Je crois que c'était toi, lol"

She apologized for speaking French and then turned around and met me.
We hugged clumsily.
I am too much in my mind about not invading the other person's boundaries.
Even if I were to ask—like she did when she left—,
I would still worry that they were being too nice.

I thought about offering the place that Abby proposed last night,
but we instead walked towards St-Laurent.
We decided to stay at an Indian place and had lunch there.

We chatted about ourselves.
I'll probably forget most about what she told me.
My memory hasn't been doing very well.
She went to that same high school that the girl at the Halloween party went to,
the same one where Antonija went as well.
Are they all of the same age?
Probably not.

We talked about the burlesque show.
She's a survivor of assault?
Neurodivergent.
Two sisters and a brother.
This is the first time I said I have a brother and a sister.

We walked to this cat cafe, but there was a long line.
We instead walked to Chinatown and had some bobba tea.
We went towards old port and carried on the conversation.
She talked about her village.
Her little town, her parents' farm.
Her accent was sweet, and I particularly loved how she would imitate the voice
of her own mother.

Then the date ended.

This time, even though everything went _well_,
instead of feeling excited and wanting to share it with Monica,
I started a bunch of more impersonal conversations with Alda, Anahi, and
I even sent a message to Paty.

I haven't talked at all about last night's dance and panic when I got an
erection in the middle of the dance floor grinding with this girl nor about
how now I guess Alda really doesn't know I am transgender.

I am not obligated to tell her.
I didn't lie to her.
Why does it still feel like I betrayed her?

I went to pee and saw my eyes.
They're very red and irritated.
I didn't wear the lenses today.
Last night I didn't struggle so much to take them off, either.

I will have lots of stuff to tell Calli next appointment in a week and a half.
Aliza's night in DC, last night's dance, and the envy I felt towards Abby;
today's date.

I guess a lot can still happen between today and then.
We just talked today's about self-fulfilling prophecies.

When I told Alda about the date, she said it sounded really nice.

It does, it was.
But then again, so was Flore's and I know how that ended.

### Sunday, November 14th, 2021
"I had a very nice afternoon today!
I really liked you [...]
I'd love to see you again, let me know if you feel the same way."

"I do! I do feel the same way! [...]
No, really; thought you were so delightful!"

***

The cover fee was 10 CAD with 3 CAD for the coats.
Someone said that the coat closet was mandatory.
We didn't have enough cash for all of us.

"Maybe we can sneak you in."

I felt a sudden cold flash of anxiety.

The woman at the entrance asked a girl for her ticket.

I went back to the ATM and just took out some cash.
I walked towards the end of the line.

"Did they send you back?", said the guy in line in front of me.

He was a guy coming alone to the club.
He was visiting from Chicago for work and decided to get a night out.
I would later see him several times inside.

Two or three times I saw Alda and Abby glancing back at the line looking for me.
Maybe I would have been allowed to feel annoyed at them, but I honestly didn't.

When I finally entered, we went straight towards the restrooms.
Abby was the first one to get into a stall, then Alda.

Two girls were standing in front of me, but I wasn't sure they were in line.
Instead of just barging in, I moved back to the line.
I touched the shoulder of the girl in front of me and pointed to the vacant
stall in front of us.
When she went in, I saw Abby being pulled by the hand by a girl.

I came out from the stall and met Alda outside.

"Where's Abby?"

"She went dancing", I told her trying to mask the envy in my voice.

We were dancing next to each other.
I was too conscious of every single move my body made.
Trying to enjoy myself was getting very tiring.

I saw a pair of girls approach us.
I exchanged glances with the one of the right, but ended up dancing with the other.
She was dark blonde and her eyes reminded me of a tiger.

Slowly we were facing each other and went closer and closer until our thighs
were interlocked.
Her fingers kept gracing my arm and I put my hand on her lower back with as
much care as if she were made of porcelain.

We would go down a little towards the floor and I would feel the warmth of her
legs through her jeans.
The feeling of her black blouse sticked to my fingers even when I would shyly
take my hand away without knowing where else to put it.

I kept looking at her feline eyes and imagining how I would approach her neck
and slowly wander towards her mouth were not for our masks in the way.

She pulled her's down and asked for my name.

The music got in the way so she moved her ear towards me.

"I'm Meghan." I felt the warmth of her whisper.

A storm was developing inside my stomach;
I could feel a throbbing pull in my lower abdomen.

I didn't mind it until I started feeling something move under my skirt.
I didn't know how to move so she wouldn't realize that I wasn't flat under
there.

Did she notice it? She must have.

"Well, Sofia, I will be going to the restroom; you're very pretty."

I woke up around one or two hours ago.
It's 6h right now.
I keep wanting to go back to the pictures of the conversation with Kate,
but I have to remind myself not to get my hopes up.

I get too invested way too quickly.
*Last week I didn't know she existed*.

_...she'd only loved two things.
The first was her long dark hair.
The second was how easily she could cut it off and felt nothing_.

I'm starting to feel tired again.
My eyes feel puffy and heavy.

_I hate dating with a passion._

Like an unconscious instinct,
I went to Her and started looking at profiles of several women.
I wasn't interested in any of them.

I was taken back by how quickly Abby was swiping the profiles of the women in
her Tinder.
She barely needed to see more than the first picture.
She was as quick to accept a girl as she was to discard another
entirely and throw her away ready to look at the next one.
Only some times would she stop and open the profile to glance to the first
lines of their description or to see some of the other pictures.

Is that how people see me on the apps?

Maybe there was nothing wrong with my Tinder profile after all.

### Monday, November 15th, 2021
"Pues no sé, pero igual está un poco feo que salgas con ella porque te
recuerda a otra chica, ¿sabes?"

_Don't date other trans women.
It was a hypocritical rule.
Had anyone else ever ruled her as ineligible for dating on account of her gender,
she'd have cried transphobia.
But in her own secret heart, the idea of dating another trans woman repelled her.
She understood but did not want to admit that
__the repulsion spoke to her own self-disgust__._

"Crees que eso te pasó con Alice?", asked me Monica when I sent her
the extract of my book.

I can very clearly see all of the warning signs in my behavior.
I am wandering through dangerous territory.
Easily, I allowed myself to be calmed by her quick answer.
Her _I do feel the same way_ is another version of that _well, I hope so_.
I should know better.

Maybe I do, and that's why I sent another messages to several new girls.
I matched with another handful.
A trans woman; another francophone woman.
I sent a new message to the one who asked me if I spoke Spanish.

What am I looking for? I've threaded these waters before and I almost drowned.

I feel a soreness in my throat.
Yesterday, I spent most of the Sunday in bed.
It made sense; I had walked around 30 kilometers in the last 36 hours and
slept less than 5 hours the previous night.

The exhaustion stayed even after a full night of sleep.
I browsed around the incubation period of COVID-19.
I went to the club Friday night.
It's been only two days since the potential infection.
_It surely must be too short time for the symptoms to appear after that_,
I thought.
Although the median is five days,
most websites report a possible incubation period between two and 14 days.

Would I send Kate a message warning her if I test positive?
I told her how I had gone to this club.
I'd be making a fool of myself if some days later I text her to tell her that
I might have infected her.

No, it doesn't make sense.
It was less than 12 hours since I had gone to the club.
I wouldn't have started to be infectious by then.
There's no point.
It would actually help me to have some willpower and not contact her.

There is a testing center close to the MNI.
I could walk there tomorrow; they take walk-ins.
Perhaps I can even make an appointment.
It would help me with the anxiety, at least.
I would have an excuse to give Louis about my lack of progress this week.
Even if it comes negative, I am feeling a bit under the weather.

I received the letter with the PIN for my USD card.
Still, when I tried to change it online several errors kept appearing
telling me that my contact information was wrong.
The other website still shows no bought prepaid cards.
I will need to call the line and ask for their help.

With the bank letter, there was another envelope addressed to Alda from Hydro Quebec.
I brought it home with me and put it on the table in the living room to take a
picture and send it to her.

"I think they sent you the hydro bill, honey."

"Haha, I'm apparently the head of the family here."

We laughed about our little inside joke and then she offered me the last
gossip of her life.
Apparently, Abby offered her to have a threesome with Zack, her boyfriend.
Alda had told her before how she had a mild crush on him.
She was telling me some of this information on our way home from Abby's place.

Alda sent me the screenshots of her conversation.
Abby was backtracking a bit of her own comments of how Zack is softer now.
Her intent of selling Alda the idea was barely hidden.
Alda told her how she has this rule of not hooking up with people she works or
lives with. *Maybe after she graduates, though*.

I told her how I have a similar rule.
_Don't shit where you eat._

I have lost count of how many times I have broken it.
Both Catherine and Monica were my classmates.
I asked Molly out even though I knew she was connected to Alda's group of friends.
I swiped right to Vicky's profile after freaking out about seeing a labmate in
a dating app.

If the test comes positive, I will need to postpone my session with Calli.

### Tuesday, November 16th, 2021
"That sounds so lovely! Let's try and do that soon."

"Wey esa salida la pido yo."

It was one of those nights.
The kind of night where I am lying under my sheets but the sickness is
hanging over me.
There was fire in my throat.
Every half a minute I had to swallow saliva and feel it scratching its way down.
I kept burping over and over.
I have no idea of how much I managed to sleep, but I enjoyed none of it.

I wore my mask for going to the restroom.
Alda said she felt fine.
Although he was a bit nervous, Armando was not annoyed by the situation.
I am not sure how I would have felt in his place.

The appointment for the test was at noon.

I don't remember to whom it was the first audio, probably Armando.
I heard my own voice and realized that I was not imagining it.
At night, when the fever would not let me rest,
I started to worry about actually getting sick.

As soon as I woke up,
I grabbed my phone and saw that there were several new notifications in different apps.
Armando and Alda were worried.
Paty, too.
The francophone girl in Her replied back.
Kate did, too, finally.

I haven't sent anything back to her.
The obvious choice was to wait until I got my results.
If it were positive, there was nothing else to do but tell her directly how
she should get tested and sincerely apologize.
If it were to come back negative, I would have more options.
I could either make no mention of it and just continue the conversation hoping
to feel better by the time we agree to meet again
or I could make a playful comment related to that, with the assurance that,
given that the test is negative, there is nothing to worry—or blame me—about it.

I didn't shower.
I just changed my clothes, put on a coat and a scarf, and went on my way.
Armando was in the kitchen when I came out of my room.
He also was wearing a mask.
We talked for a bit before my departure time.

I was wearing the red leggings that I brought from Mexico.
They're actually surprisingly good for keeping the heat.
Between them and my winter coat, I didn't pass much cold even though it was
lightly snowing on my whole way.

I got there maybe 10 minutes before my appointment time.
I managed to understand a little of what the people were saying in French,
but not enough to be able to avoid apologizing and asking to switch to English.

When I got to the nurse that took my information,
I was extra attentive to the information she was putting in the computer.
*Femme*.
I let out a sigh of relief.

Alda had told me about the time she went to take the test.
They gave her the gargle one.
It was the same thing with Ana, from the lab.
I was going expecting to have that one, too.

I was wrong.

 It was not as bad as the one in Mexico.
 Maybe the q-tip was shorter.
 Perhaps the dr was more skillful.
 I'll get the results somewhen between tonight and the next couple of days.
 If I don't get them by Friday, the lady said,
 I have to call to a phone number.

_You'll receive an e-mail if it's negative or a phone call if it's positive._

On my way home, I met with Armando.
Was he going to his lab?
I remembered how when I go to the Wellness Hub,
one of the questions is if I've met with anyone who's awaiting their results
for a COVID test.

First he was going to go to get tested at the Trottier building.
Depending on the results, he'd either go to his office or go to the hospital
for the PCR test.

If he tested positive to that one, then that would mean a high chance that
he got it from me and thus, that I will test positive as well.

He didn't, though.
He never received any notification about positive results.
I'm still waiting for mine.

I sent Louis a short e-mail telling him the situation and asking for some
days off.
I would keep him posted about the results.

He replied back pretty quickly.
He's sorry that I am not feeling well and of course I can take the days off.

I'll send him another e-mail whenever I get the results.

I have no clue about what I'll do with Kate.

### Wednesday, November 17th, 2021
Although I do feel better, I am still sick.

It is not COVID, at least.
In the middle of the night I saw an email from an official Québec e-mail address.
I didn't have to open it to know that it was the negative results.
I sent a screenshot of the e-mail to Armando.

I got inside the portal and took another screenshot from the cleaner results.
That was the one that I sent to the rest of the people.
I went back to sleep, this time I rested.

I woke up definitely around 8h.
I typed a reply to Kate,
telling her that I was glad she liked the idea for our date and that I looked
forward to it.

Then, not much later, I sent a different message about how the weather was
supposed to be agreeable this weekend. _Would Saturday work for her?_

I didn't expect an answer until later today or even tomorrow.
Instead, I got a disappointing response before my coffee.

She replied to my first message saying that she, too, looks forward to it.
Then, she apologized but she can't this weekend.
She has a trip to Ottawa.

I told Armando.
He found the coincidence hilarious.
This would be the third girl that disappears after a weekend trip.

I mean, she won't, right?
She seems interested, or at least she knows how to pretend to be.

I don't feel like writing the words.
I feel this temptation to just cheat and go back to bed.
I watched the first 15 minutes of the _Cowboy Bebop_ movie while I ate my bowl
of pasta.
I am done eating for the day.

Now that I know it's not COVID, I can go and buy groceries myself.
Maybe this weekend.
Or maybe next week.
There's still enough burritos in the freezer to last me for a while.
I haven't finished the pasta nor the sauce.

In the morning I sent another email to Louis.
I told him how the results came back negative,
but still I am feeling not that well.
He told me that it was good that it wasn't COVID,
and that it might be that my immune system it's not used to this northern
kind of flu viruses.

The new spider-man trailer came out today.

I've been chatting with Armando a lot.
He hasn't made any comments, like Alda, that assure me he has no idea about
my identity.
He hasn't made any that would suggest he suspects it, either.

He did joke back when I told him that my laugh sounded manlier than it always
does.

Last night when Alda knocked on my door to give me the medicine she bought for me,
she also made a comment about how she found my voice too funny.

I am almost finished with my book.
I've really enjoyed it.
This is the first book that makes me want to highlight parts of its text.

In the afternoon, after starting to have a runny nose,
I took two antihistamine pills.
They knocked me out.
I had to lie down on the bed, but I don't think I slept that much.
I am going through my packets of Kleenex at an alarming rate.
They might not survive this sickness week.

I guess it was a good thing that Kate was busy this weekend.
I would feel too nervous about being contagious or of she noting I don't look
that well.

When I showed Alda her messages,
she laughed at my comment about being cursed.
She said how it only means that I'll have to wait another week.

But does it, really?

I am not taking this, her, in a healthy way.
She's not looking for anything serious nor exclusive.
She was very clear about that.

I said it, too, how I wasn't looking for any commitments either.
And here I am, fixating on this other girl whom I only exchanged an afternoon.
And talking about her to all the people I know.

God, I hate myself sometimes.
What void am I trying to fill with these people?
Why am I so desperate to be found attractive?

It's not even that, is it?
Sonny finds me attractive, she desired me, and I rejected her.
Even before coming to Canada, I turned my back on her.

This girl at the club came to me and danced with me.
Do I really believe that I didn't know about the restroom code?

Would I had gone with her if she had been more direct?
Would I end up feeling even a bit less empty inside?

### Thursday, November 18th, 2021
"I'm so happy to have my best friend around again!"

I woke up around 3h in the morning.
I grabbed the kindle and finished the book.
It was very good.
I enjoyed it.
It was something entirely new for me,
feeling identified in the characters and their pain.
For a moment I even think I stopped hating being trans.
I can't remember any other time when I felt like I wasn't different,
something special, or unique.
A one-off character.

I'll see Calli this Tuesday.
I am not really sure why I feel repulsed to the idea of talking about my
dating life with her.
It's as if it were a pathetic topic of conversation,
as if its banality makes it not worth to mention.

She might ask about what I did after our last session.
What did I do?
I know that the topic of Aliza and what happened—or did not happen—that night
in Maryland came up.

I stopped at the _dépanneur_ and bought a bottle of wine and a bag of chips.
Was it that night when Vicky accepted the request?
No, it was when I browsed Flore's Instagram and got myself blocked.
I got drunk and high.

I can talk about that night in Maryland.
What does it mean to be confused by it.
The feeling that my body is not worth the same.
The contradiction of feeling both invaded and not worthy of desire.

I could talk about the weekend at the club.
That is the most obvious topic to follow last session's topic of my body dysphoria.
I felt disgusted, and insecure, and betrayed by my own body.
Alda and Abby saw the girls' signal because they had no idea of what
happened under my skirt.
I am not sure that the girl wasn't actually getting rid of me because of it.

Alda's sincere question outside the gym about my periods.
She knows some people that experience this sort of thing.
I don't owe her an explanation.
I want her to know, though, don't I?

Was it that day when I sent the other message to Kate?
I think it was.
We would go out the next morning.
A very similar date to that other french girl.
And from the similarities came a sense of dread.
A sort of _déjà vu_ that whispered to me how things would end up in
disappointment.

Other than her accent, there was nothing else that linked the two girls.
Kate knew from the start that I am trans—she did, right?
She asked me for my coming out, but at the same time seemed pretty familiar
with the information of my profile—,
the conversation flowed, and we had a good time;
she was the first one to bring up meeting again.

_She felt the same way_.
She likes the idea of going out again and looks forward to it.

Is she just being nice?
Is she just having pity on me?
No, that's absurd.

She hasn't replied to my last message.
There is nothing more to say.
I don't think I should continue the conversation until after her trip.
Maybe after my session with Calli.

Eduardo sent me an e-mail today,
asking me if I was interested in giving a class for him.
I could show his students how to do some network analysis.
I accepted, as if I were not already overworked.

I should prepare something this weekend. It's too late now to back off.

It's fine, the extra work will keep my head busy.

I opened up Bumble again.
I had another match.
It's the second in all this time since I remade my profile.

I have not sent anything to her.
I probably won't.

I got an email from McGill.
The subject was something like _friendly reminder about your account_.
In it, they wanted to remind me that I haven't made any payments towards my tuition.
Even though I do have a deferral, it's going to end in December.
I have to pay all of Fall's balance before asking to defer Winter's.
I had enough in my checking account to pay it.

I posted a meme on my Instagram.
It was the scene from the Simpsons where Bart mocks graduate students for
being 30 year olds that earn 600 USD a year.
I got some comments and reactions.
To be totally honest, I just wanted to see if Kate would see it.

She did; her faceless picture was in there among the rest of them.

### Friday, November 19th, 2021

"Mi POV es un _no nos llames nosotros te llamamos_."

"[Not gonna lie] Si te ves algo _clingy_ con el
_dime cuándo vuelvas para tocarte las nalgas_."

"Rodrigo me tiene bloqueada en todas las redes sociales y [Whatsapp]!
Hace tiempo que no veo nada de él y ahorita busqué y __nada__."

I keep avoiding writing the words.
I don't know the reason behind it.
A couple of things happened today, it's not like I don't have anything to write about.
I want to go to bed, but I won't get out of this chair until these words are finished.

Coming back to this paragraph is like a weight that's numbing my arm,
but somehow I can't let go.

Last night I tried to masturbate before falling asleep.
I couldn't do it.
I gave up after around 20 minutes.
It could be because of the antidepressants, maybe.

At midnight I grabbed the phone and I had a message from Kate.
I wasn't expecting anything from her, so it caught me off guard.
My last message was telling her that we could do it some other time
and wishing her a good time on her trip.
What else was there to say? _Thank you_?

Instead, she said, "Yes with pleasure!"

She thanked me,
and then added how she was excited because it was her first time there.

I put the phone away.
I could had left it right then and there.
I might have actually planned to do just that.
Wait until next week and then, if no communication, just ask about her trip.
Instead, when I woke up 7 hours after that,
I made a clingy comment telling her to let me know whenever she'd be free.
I feel awkward just now rereading that message from the conversation.

Again, there was no need to add anything more to that.
Except that's not true, the only reasonable thing to do after something so
cringe-y, is to put an end to it _nicely_.
And with a happy face as a period after her _I will_ she did just that.

Now, it's almost a sure thing that I won't hear from her after her trip.

A couple of days ago—maybe last week—I saw this drama on twitter.
One of the trans girls from Mexican twitter posted something about Yaaj and Ivan.
I didn't give much attention to it at the time.
It wasn't even close to the level of discomfort I felt when I
recognized Said's name in that declaration on Facebook last year.
I let it go.

Today, that drama grew and grew until the small snowball became an avalanche
that might just destroy the credibility of Yaaj as a whole.
Even I—who, as I was telling both Eliseo and Paty, don't really have any
issues with any members of Yaaj—couldn't really defend what they,
specifically Paola and Josue, are doing.

It reminded me a lot of what Rodrigo did with Monica.
She had told him that his insinuations and flirting made her uncomfortable.
Going from what she told me in confidence, it wasn't even his intentions what
had upset her, but his treating her as an object to be consumed on the side
whenever he's tired of his relationship with his girlfriend.
After she told him that they, indeed, made her uncomfortable,
he stopped and became colder and distant.
That, too, was only a couple of days ago.

Today she realized while chatting with me that she hadn't been seeing
anything from him lately.
When she looked him up, she realized he had blocked her.
Still in disbelief, she asked me to look him up, too.
I could see how the small spark of hope that he had just deleted everything,
that he had faded from the face of the earth,
or anything but the obvious, vanished when I sent her the screenshots of his
profile in Instagram from my phone.

I knew the feeling too well.
It has happened to me, before.
Twice.
Lately with Flore—as I would later finally tell her about—and a couple of years
ago with Anahí.

I could have told her that it might be temporary.
He might come back later and look her up.
It happened with Anahi and me—fuck, it even happened to her and I—,
but I realized quickly that was just part of the problem.
It's not the first time he has done this.

All day I considered telling her about Kate's message and get her opinion.
Maybe she'd say she's _totally flirting_ with me,
like she did with the first messages of Molly;
perhaps, that she seems _very nice_, like with the ones of Flore;
maybe, she'd say that she's just being nice and setting the stage so I stop
pushing her, like Anahi's point of view;
or that I seemed to pushy and clingy with my last message,
just as Armando said.

In the end, I didn't sent the pictures to her.

### Saturday, November 20th, 2021
"I feel I'm not woman enough, period."

I am a little bit drunk right now.
We were supposed to go out tonight to a bar.
I had asked Armando yesterday or the night before to take me out.
He had offered me to drink after Kate said she would go out to her weekend trip.
We invited Alda later and she said she'd join us.

I went to shower around noon.
I put on cream and gel on my hair and wore a decent outfit.
When I came back to my room I saw several messages on the group chat that
we have as roommates.

The plans for today were cancelled.
The first message I saw were from the latests, from Armando.
He was asking my opinion about it.
I scrolled up.
He heard I was still coughing, so maybe it would be better if we cancelled,
because I'd be scaring people.
Then I got to the first messages from Alda, the ones that started everything,
she might have gotten the flu as well.
She's not been feeling very well, and thus, sadly,
she would have to cancel on us this evening.

I had still my hair wet and wearing normal clothes.
I put on a scarf and a coat and grabbed my backpack to go get some groceries.

I sent a personal message to Alda asking her if she needed anything.
She declined my offer.

I went to Newon market, but, before that, I made a stop at the SAQ on the way.
I bought a bottle of Vodka Lemon.

At Newon market I got some food.
Noodles, vegetables, and shit.
I walked back to the apartment.
After climbing Simpson Hill, instead of going straight to the apartment,
I turned left and went to the _dépanneur_.
I heard the cashier and her lady friend speaking in Spanish.

I filled the basket in my arm with grapefruit juice, a bag of jalapeño
chips and a loaf of bread.
I said _hola_ to her, but she continued the interaction in English.

When I came back to my place, I took off the coat instead of the mask.
Armando had said that after hearing my negative results he stopped wearing his,
but he might start wearing them again.
I left mine on while I put off the groceries.

In my room, I liked the look of my outfit so I took some _selfies_.
I had that idea of posting something in my story this weekend and seeing if
Kate would look at them.

I did just that.
I posted a nice picture and just waited for it to get some attention.
This one had less reactions than previous ones.
One from Fausto—as usual—and from my mom.
I think Yomo was another one.
Nothing from her.
She hadn't even seen it.

When I post one of the pictures in my Her profile,
I looked at her profile and the distance showed she was 164 kilometers away.

I saw Fausto post a tweet about the Irene v Yaaj issue in Twitter.
Kika also had something to say about that whole mess apparently.
I took a screenshot of it—Fausto was my therapist after all—and sent it to
both Eliseo and Paty, again.

Paty, later today, posted a story about Avril Lavigne being her _emo crush_.

"Y yo que tipo de tu crush soy?", I teased her.

She hasn't seen it or replied.
Maybe she will tomorrow or in a couple of days.

"Me decepcionas, Sofia." Started Armando's texts.
"Abrí el congelador y vi tu Vodka.
Casi no le bajaste y ya andas peda."

I should go refill my drink.

I have a bit fewer than 150 words left and I don't know what else to write about.

Eli replied back to my Instagram message pretty quickly.
He asked me if I was busy later this evening.
I said no and actually proposed having a call.
I missed him, and human contact in general.
We did just that.

He called me first on Instagram and we talked for around an hour.
First about the thing with Yaaj and Ivan and later about stuff in general.
We then moved to Zoom.
We had touched the subject about my COVID scare so I told him about Flore and
the club night.
Halfway through my story, I recognized the familiar moment when I am so much
into a story that I stop realizing how the recipient is not really that into it.
Why would he care about my date and french girls in general?
I rushed through most of the rest and we continued talking about other stuff.

### Sunday, November 21th, 2021
"Rodrigo se casó ayer. Did you know?"

I woke up with the alarm at 9h30 in the morning.
I don't know which was louder, the cheerful tune coming from the phone's
speaker or the throbbing pain coming from within my head.
I didn't go back to sleep.
Instead I went to the kitchen to prepare my coffee with the hopes that it would
help with the hangover.

I looked into the freezer with curiosity about how much I had actually drunk
the night before.
Armando had sent me a message saying that he saw the bottle and I hadn't
actually lowered it that much.
It is half-empty, now.

I guess if Armando knew—or suspected, at least—about me,
he would had said or asked something by now.
We've been talking more and more lately.
I don't feel with him the same kind of sense that I am betraying him
as I did with Alda.

"Era un _bato_ que se identificaba como chava lencha?"

I guess some people would take issue with his use of the _lencha_ term.
I've used it with him, before.
I refer to myself that way—even though just today I told Sonny that I haven't
really identified with that identity for a while now.

I told him that one of my tinder dates was a trans girl.
I made no mention of the funny occurrence that both of us were and neither
knew it.

He was, surprisingly, excited about the idea.
I guess we are some sort of a special thing,
a checklist that people can cross from their lists.

"We que verga, por qué te freseaste?
Te hubiera podido meter el pilín una shaba!"

For a moment I considered asking him if he'd be up to hooking up with a trans
woman.
It didn't take much consideration before I got to the conclusion that it was
something from which I didn't really want an answer.

Last night I had seen a story about Rodrigo's wedding.
I took a screenshot to send it to Monica.
Apparently, I forgot.
Today, again, from Rodrigo himself I saw that same story.
He shared several of those.
I asked Monica if she knew.
She asked me, clarifying, if I meant Chevo, instead.
_No; Rodrigo, Retana_.

She was surprised.
She had no idea.
I guess he never told her.
Perhaps that was the reason all along behind the block.

We talked about his wedding, how the place was very tacky.
She said it looked like a bar, but I think it was probably a party salon.

I'm not sure what exactly was it, but I pictured my own wedding.

"Supongo que sí;
si yo me casara preferiría que fuera en primavera o verano—bien _cliché_,
I know—pero no en Noviembre o Diciembre.
Y ajá, obvio no sería en una iglesia porque, pues, _gay_;
pero no lo sé, lo imagino al aire libre, como en el _countryside_ o la playa,
aunque no me encanta la idea de la playa."

I thought she would made a comment judging my ideas.
_Oh, honey, no, beach weddings are lame,
I picture you getting married in an old abandoned church_,
or something of the like.
Instead, she replied with excitement.

For a moment I saw myself wearing a simple white dress,
with my hair tied up except for a couple of curls falling to the side of my
head.

I felt a warmth inside my chest.
In my almost 30 years, I don't think I had ever imagined myself as a bride.
A wedding was never something I really cared about, much less fantasize with.

Will it ever happen, though?

I asked Sonny pointblank if she didn't identify as a woman.
I think it was last night, when I told her that I've been feeling a higher
libido, but I picture myself with someone _femme_.

"Ayer me dio un poco de gracia algo.
Dijiste que querías salir con alguien más femenina que tú.
_Gurl, you're super feminine_.
No creo que sea posible."

She told me that one of her friends shared with her a dream she had where
Sonny had asked her and a friend to call her *Michael*
I changed her contact name to _Maykol_.

I finally sent the screenshots of Kate's conversation to Monica.
I told her the coincidence of the weekend trip.
She made no comment about her messages or mine.

The only thing she said after was: "¿Ya no te contestó?"

There's nothing left to do but wait for her to send a new message
somewhen, somehow.

How long will I wait before fully being convinced that she's not interested in
me?

Why would she have been?
Why would anyone ever be?

### Monday, November 22th, 2021
"Oye, Aliza, ¿te puedo hacer una pregunta super random?
¿Te acuerdas cuando te quedaste a dormir en mi casa en Maryland porque
perdimos tu tren?
Esa noche no pasó nada entre nosotras, ¿verdad?"

"Hey, how are you feeling?
I've been thinking about some stuff that I've wanted to share with you.
I know you're not feeling too well,
so I won't propose smoking and we can wear masks, but yeah, let's chat soon."

Nothing happened. It was all in my head, nothing more than a very *vivid* dream.

The bottle of Vodka is almost finished.
This morning I didn't have a hangover.

Alda answered back pretty quickly,
but by the end of the night she wasn't feeling it.

This morning, while she was cleaning, she told me we could hang out.
She hasn't come back.
Probably I won't end up telling her.

I'm not sure what made me change my mind.
_Y tú? Tú saldrías con una mujer trans?_
I already knew what he would say.
Most people have the same answer.
He's a straight man, almost all of them have the same response.
I could have bet all of my savings knowing that his answer would only make me
feel more uncomfortable later. Yet, I sent the question anyway.

Is that why I don't know about telling Alda anymore?

I brought up the subject again with Monica, Paty and Eliseo.
Monica's response was harsh.
She's tired of me—not me personally, but my insistence of beating around the
bush instead of doing anything about it.
Eliseo and Paty, queer themselves, were more sensible to the idea.
Why don't I ease into it?
Maybe bring up the subject.
_I went out on a date with someone trans._
I did go out on a date with a trans woman.

Bringing up that subject made me feel sure that telling Armando is not a good idea.
Am I ready to have that realization about Alda?
It would be better than figuring that out after she knows about me.
I can't *untell* her.

"Es un no nos llames, nosotros te llamamos."

It's only Monday; a weekday.
If she were the actually send me a message, it wouldn't be today in any case.

This is not doing me any good.
I am way too attached after only one date.
Again.

What is it with me?
Why can't I get rid of the idea that nobody enjoys my company?
_She would rather go out with any other new people_.
It doesn't matter that she literally said otherwise.
That's what any person would say just to be nice.

Perhaps I can use this as practice for cutting people off.
People I am actually interested in.

Thursday I have the class for Eduardo.
I haven't done anything productive today.
The only progress I've managed to do about that class was discard the first
part of the analysis.

Am I too busy with this Alda thing?
Or is it about Kate?
Maybe it's Calli's session.

This should have helped me to get distracted, not the other way around.

How long have I been taking the antidepressants?
Just now I felt very dizzy for a moment.
I considered having the rest of the bottle.
There's not grapefruit juice left and I couldn't give any less of a shit.

Almost two weeks.
I should know if this is enough time for the paradoxical effect to wear off.
I was a psychologist for a while.

_What am I now?_

I ate more today than other days.
I made myself a bacon sandwich with an egg after the Neuro meeting.
Not much later, I ate the single slice of ham and two wienner sausages.
A couple hours ago I started the fast after finishing one of the frozen burritos.

I am still feeling hungry.
Is it the antidepressants or the depressive symptoms?
I'll miss losing weight.

I went and had a couple of sips from the bottle.
I didn't lower it much.
I can't stand too much the flavor of it straight.
Maybe that's a good thing.
Tomorrow I can buy a couple of cans of soda after the session.

No, I should make some progress.
I can't just back off now.
I'd rather do a shitty job for the class.
He can't do it himself.
That's why he asked.
I am expecting too much from myself.
Half-assing it will be better than dropping it.
I'll be fine.

How many days before I stop thinking about this french girl?

Or how many before I succumb to the pressure and send another pathetic message?

### Tuesday, November 23th, 2021

"Armando has no clue about you."

_It was a very white and snowy morning.
Has the 'skirts/dresses' movement sadly come to an end this year?_

The Vodka is done.
Just a couple days more than a weekend.
Am I back in my old ways?

I told Calli how I've been feeling _down_ recently;
it's probably because of the antidepressants.

Had I finished the words before going outside with Alda last night?
Earlier that morning she mentioned how we could hang out later in the afternoon.
She was probably curious about what I wanted to tell her.
I certainly would be in her place.
She offered me to share a joint and we stepped outside the balcony.
Armando wasn't home so, were I to tell her,
it would be a good time to do it before he came back.

I didn't.
Maybe I was too sober, or maybe I was just too scared.

I won't do any work tonight.
I'll go to the _dépanneur_ and get some alcohol.

The same two girls of that other time were there.
This time I didn't try to speak in Spanish.

Why did I last time?
I have Armando here to practice it.
Jose Luis will be after Armando goes off.
I have several people back in Mexico to keep using it.
It's the English that I need to keep practicing.

I am trying to feel these words as if there were something that I am avoiding
to write about.

I spoke with Calli today.
It was... how was it?
It wasn't necessarily hard.
Sure, I cried, but don't I most of the times lately?

What did this session have that was different to other ones?
I talked about Kate and how I kept thinking about Flore.
The unspoken rules and conventions, the code.
Things that go without saying but I am not able to comprehend.

What is it right now?
I feel this deep pain in the mouth of my stomach.

I opened the camera of Instagram as if I were to post a story,
and the image of the girl on the phone wasn't the usual one that makes me cringe.
She just looked in so much pain that I wanted her to materialize so I could
hug her.

I wish I could sit by my own side and just cry in my own shoulder.

I thought about sending another message to Kate.
When I told Alda last night I wouldn't send her another message,
her reaction was as if it were a totally strange—although still valid—position
to take.

"Oh, sure, if I wanted to see if she also initiates, maybe?" She guessed.

What else would I be losing with this new message?
If she were going to ghost me, she'd do it whether I send her anything more or not.

I am the older person here.
I am almost five years her senior.

What the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I this socially awkward?

I think Alda's room is lightened up.
She could be in there, but maybe she's just left it turned on before going
to her parents'.

I sent her an image earlier today.
I little meme about men, lesbians and bisexual people flirting.
I'm not sure if she considers herself bisexual or not.

Deep down I hoped she would answer me so I could invite her to hang out with
me in the living room.
Perhaps this could be the time when I do dare to tell her.

I told Monica that talking with Calli had made me feel more serene with the
idea of telling her.
I wasn't doubtful anymore, but I wasn't feeling rushed either.

Armando just got in.
It's 20h.

"Pero cuando Alda me preguntó por mis periodos,
aunque fue básicamente lo mismo de
_huh, I guess she doesn't know then_,
en vez de sentirma contenta, me sentí *sola*."

Calli asked me how would it feel the idea of...

Armando just went to the kitchen to heat his food.
I asked him about the videocall with Jose Luis.
Alda came in not much later.
I guess she wasn't here, after all.

I asked her if she was free on Thursday, thinking about the call,
but she said she was free after 21h or 22h.
Maybe we could actually do something, like going out again.
Friday would be better, she said.

She came back not much later and offered me to share a joint.
We did.

Again,
Armando was inside his room so I didn't even consider the idea of telling her.
Perhaps another time.

When I came in, I saw Kate had replied back to my message.
She laughed and I sincerely have no clue if she actually found it amusing or
if she was just being nice.

"How are you doing these days?" Says her last message before she went back
offline until tomorrow morning, I suppose.

### Wednesday, November 24th, 2021
"Oh wow! What's the book called?...

"Haha yep, you must address this need! OMG, you really want to make me read it!

"What's the next book you'd really like to read?"

Eduardo sent me an e-mail asking if it was OK with me to connect half an hour
before our agreed time.
One hour might not be enough time.
I thought I'd be having two.
Yeah, one hour it's barely enough time to cover the basics.

I still haven't finished.
I need to figure out how to visualize some of the networks.
Maybe I could skip that part.
It's going to be midnight, soon.

I'm now sure that the antidepressants are working on me.
It's been a little over two weeks since I started taking them.
I am feeling just as I did when I started worrying that it was depression.

The Rmarkdown document can create the graphs.
It can extract the variables.
I could only just add a small linear regression and a plot of the results, maybe.
That'd be enough.
I could then go to sleep or cry in my bed.
Still I can't go back to RStudio.
I keep grabbing the phone waiting for something to happen.
It's 23h, she's not going to answer me now.

I don't remember if there was an alarm this morning.
I might have disabled it even before it started.
I remember the action of grabbing the pillow and putting it over my face.
I didn't want to get up; I didn't want to be awake.

Last night she did reply once.
She laughed at my comment about living vicariously through her and said she
has been good, _very busy but good_.

I then said something about the book I finished.
It was unprompted, completely out of the blue, just sharing,
moving the conversation forward.

I am not being _delightful_, I am being obnoxious.

_Ya me dijo de ti, que sigues encima de ella y no sabe cómo decirte que no.
Eres feo, tío; acéptalo_.

Last night, somehow, I asked Sonny about her mom, if she knew about me.
She tried to avoid the subject telling me that she _believed she did_.
Later she was more direct.
Her mom said it was not obvious.

I stopped replying to her messages.

When I grabbed my phone, I saw Kate asking me about the book.
Then she made a comment that she might want to read it.
She sent a follow-up question.
Although she viewed my answer, she didn't continue.
She literally just told me she's been very busy.

I still fixated on how she came back to Whatsapp over and over,
but my question stayed unanswered.

I didn't have any other book next on my list.
Has she read anything interesting?
Maybe she hasn't and just left it like that.
Perhaps she saw the question and told herself that she'd answer me later.

Why am I obsessing about this girl that I've met once?
Why am I like this?

"Pero me dijo que había sido porque te escondiste la barbilla,
que sino nunca lo hubiera notado."

Whenever I walk towards the bathroom to take a shower I put the towel over my mouth.
I haven't been shaving daily given that I haven't showered daily either.

Tomorrow I will need to.
My coffee is almost finished.
There's less than a week left in November.
Three more weeks and I'll be travelling to Mexico.

Why am I not excited anymore about going to the beach?
I don't care about wearing the bathing suit and having more pictures.
What's the point?

I don't care about seeing Monica or Anahí.
O
I don't even care about seeing my family or hugging Nymeria.

Anahí sent me the picture of 6 years ago, when I was still living as a him.
We were sitting—she, Catherine, and me—in a cafe outside her therapist's
office.

"Cuando me dijiste que si me latía ir a la UABC a hacer _closure_,
esa misma noche me quedé pensando en eso.
Me pasó por la cabeza preguntarte si habías pensado hacerlo también con la
Cata; como aparte.
Consideré decirte si querías invitarla también.
I mean __eramos las 3__...

"Ya después me quedé pensando que _maybe_ sería muy _awkward_ y que probablemente
no sería muy buena idea. _Too much drama._
Se pondría en medio y sería como hacerlo más pedo de nosotras dos cuando pues
esa no es la intención original...
Ajá, no.
Quiero hacerlo contigo.
Y ya, me dormí y se me olvidó.

"Pero sí, veo ese tipo de fotos de las tres y, no sé,
parece que fue tan lejos; hace toda una vida."

### Thursday, November 25th, 2021
"Oh I wish I wish!
But I have plans both nights...
I'm sorry that I'll miss that!
[...]
I don't think I've read anything interesting lately, lol,
but maybe I'll remember something next time we meet hehe."

"She doesn't seem interested.
She's just rainchecking after rainchecking.
She literally said no to both nights.
Maybe she likes you as a friend and she's willing to go out but not as a date".

My head hurts and my chest feels empty.
I've finished with Eduardo's class.
I should finish setting up the environment before sending it his way.

I ate instead.
Too much.
After finishing the eggs I went for another two sausage links.
Now I feel full and disgusting.

In 30 minutes I have Louis' meeting.
I don't have any progress to share with him.
Why am I not working right now?

It was after midnight when I sent a message to Eliseo last night.
I wasn't feeling well.
We talked a bit.
I shared with him my confusion with this french girl.
It borders on unhealthy fixation at this point.

Right now I thought about changing my number just so I could get another chance
of trying Tinder.

It's pointless, though.
I would not put in there that I am trans.
It would be the exact same fucking thing.
A bunch of meaningless matches that would just give place to uncomfortable
first dates that make me feel empty inside and much more alone than when I
started.

What is it that I wanted with this girl?
Is it the dating?
The excitement?
I am not feeling excited, I am exhausted and tired.
I am annoyed.
I am sick of feeling confused and teased by empty calls of our next meeting.

Am I feeling angry now?
Why?
She doesn't owe me anything.
She could have just ghosted me like the previous french girl.
That was the same thing, a glimpse of interest and then its disappearance.

I was not what she was looking for.
I am not what anyone is looking for.

_¿Hay algo mal en mí?_

Will it even happen, the _next time we meet_?
I won't ask for a next one.
She doesn't starts the conversations, so, yeah.
I guess this is the end of it, just as I wrote to Monica.

Is this disappointment?
I got what I asked for, their opinion.
Both of them agree that I am reading her wrong.
I was dishonest saying that I didn't know what she was feeling,
I wanted them to confirm my expectations and share my suspicions about
the disconnect between her words and actions.

Even if she were interested,
even if her hopes of actually meeting again are sincere.
They are not real.

If they were she'd look me up.
She'd ask me.

"I will", she said when I told her to tell me whenever she'd be free.

Maybe that's just it, she hasn't been free.
She's busy, she said so herself.
She's got all these plans and all these other people to meet.

Better people.

I should be busy, too.
But I am not.
I have no energy to do anything.

I told Armando that I would cancel with them if she'd agreed to do something.
That was true.
We talked about going out this Saturday.
I told Alda to do something tomorrow.
I would have cancelled them without any second thought.

I want that, I want someone to think about me and talk about me to their friends.
To cancel lesser plans they're more excited to see me.
But who would? Why would anyone?

I am broken.

I have 20 minutes to finish 150 more words.
Tears have started coming down.
Do I care enough if Louis sees them?
He'll ask me how I've been doing.
Will I tell him the truth?

I won't say I'm doing well.

The last time I replied with something different than _Good_ he was surprised.
It was as if I had gone out of script.
Was he concerned or was he just unnerved?

I don't know what else to say.
I don't want to keep filling these pages with thoughts and feelings about
girls I've met only once.

Less than 4 hours of an afternoon with a french girl who studies computer
science and I still keep writing about her several months later.

Of course she blocked me, what kind of sick person does that?
Maybe it's the male socialization that all those feminists keep hating people
like me because.

Perhaps they're right and I shouldn't exist.

### Friday, November 26th, 2021
"Let's see who the next girl is.
You should prob choose someone who doesn't like camping trips."

Louis asked me how I was doing.
I avoided the question and instead made a comment that I had just seen the
e-mail he had sent half an hour before.
But he didn't let it go.
I answered a half-truth telling him that I was having the worst headache.
_It was fine_, though. _No problem at all_...

The meeting didn't last long.
He hasn't fired me yet.

I don't know what I did between then and me falling asleep.
Probably nothing.
I might have just taken my pants off and went straight to bed.
I slept until maybe an hour or two before midnight.

I was so hungry that I broke my fast to prepare a sandwich.
I didn't even enjoy it that much.

This morning I passed it asleep.
It was a limbo-like state between slumber and wake.
Even though I had slept way more than the needed 8 hours,
I let myself be won over by this resistance to be alive.
I grabbed my phone around 9h, after the first alarm.

Alda had seen and replied to my meme about the vaccine pick-up line.
I told her that I was trying to convince Armando to go out this weekend.
Were he to agree, I'd send that cheesy pick-up line to the french girl.
I used that excuse to tell her about what happened.
This time I didn't feel the need to share the conversation.
I just told her that she's not into me as I would have wanted, as I am into her.

This time Armando didn't encourage me to do anything stupid.

"Dado lo que me dijiste ayer me rehuso a darte ideas que no sean sensatas..."

I had a clear goal to finish today.
Start the transfer.
Just start the command to download the intermediate files to have them ready
on the BIC system and be able to meet with Louis next week to work on them.
It was easy enough.
Simple.

I still couldn't do it.

Even now as I am remembering the day, I can't think of anything.
What did I do?
What is happening to me?

I put on leggings and my coat and walked on the snow to the _dépanneur_.
I bought myself a bottle of wine and a box of cookies.

Last night when I told Alda to do something,
she said she's been feeling sick, still.
I counter-offered to do something in the apartment.
We could watch a movie and order some food.

I want her to be here.
I want to be able to tell her.
I want something to really cry about.

Am I this sure that she'll take it badly?
I don't...

I wouldn't tell Armando because I'm sure he would start seeing and
treating me as a guy.

But her? She's a girl.
She wanted to live with a girl.
Maybe, perhaps this would change our living situation.
Now she'd be living with a gay dude and something _half-and-half_.

I am not even sure she doesn't know already.
Words are meaningless now.

_What about yours? Are they regular?_

_...but maybe I'll remember something next time we meet_.

When I opened Bumble, I had a new match.

In the morning Alda told me that girls don't use tinder that much.
Was she talking about her own experience?
I replied that it was mostly couples.

Just the other day, I saw that I had a match and she even sent the first message.
I opened her profile to better see the picture.
In the bio and description,
it was clearly they were a straight couple looking for a girl.

I remember years ago thinking about just sending them a risque comment to
force the unmatch on them.
_Are you sure your bf won't mind being with a girl with a bigger dick than his?_

Just typing it out brings me a stab of dysphoria.
This time I just deleted the match before the 24 hours ran out.

I got a match this afternoon.
It's a non-binary person; genderqueer.
They look attractive enough that I send them a message.
Let's see if they don't do the same thing I just did with the couple.

I am not even halfway done with the bottle and I am starting to wonder if
it was a bad idea.

This is my turn to clean the apartment.
I probably will skip it.
They should understand.

### Saturday, November 27th, 2021
"Te awitas frescas si limpio hasta el lunes?
Pensé que es sábado y todavía tengo mañana,
pero neta dudo que mañana tenga energías."

She told me twice that she was having a good feeling about me.
She offered to cook for me once, perhaps.

It was right then and there that I felt doubts and started losing interest.

I went into her profile and saw the different pictures.
I liked her eyes in the first one.
The second one was different,
I couldn't say what was it that made me feel uneasy.
By the third one I noticed that most of her pictures she covered her face
with her hand.
_Había sido porque te escondiste la barbilla, sino no lo hubiera notado_.

I stopped replying to her and kept hanging out with my wine.

I came from the shower.
Armando left the house.
I sent him a text quoting his message stating that he wouldn't drink all next
week.

"Y te vas a las 19h en sábado _pretty sus_".

I, as well, will be breaking my own promise.

The phone vibrated with the different tone of Instagram.
I thought it was a message from Paty at first.
Maybe Eli?

It was Kory.
He was asking how've I been doing.
Will I go to the queer party in Belmont tonight?

I replied to his greetings and asked him what was that.
It's a club in St-Laurent.
Tonight will be their monthly queer party.
I had just changed my shirt and yet I didn't hesitate to tell him that I
would be going.
He hadn't even confirmed me that he was going,
much less inviting me to go with him.

It would start at 22h, but there would be a line outside so we should go earlier.
I asked him if he wanted to meet and wait in line together.
He agreed.
I went to take a shower.

"Hey there! Potato wedges vs fries?"

I think I am now on my second go through all the women in HER.

There was this person that caught my interest.
Since I started playing with these apps, there might have been a handful of
people that make me wish that I would have the option to send them a direct
message.
That, instead of an empty _like_ into the void,
I could have the option to risk it all and approach them directly.
This time it was the person whose gender they described as
_Hello Kitty Gandalf_.

With HER she would be getting a notification that I, _Sofia_,
had liked her profile.
They would be getting, as well, the opportunity to glance at my profile,
see that I am trans, and then just ignore it.
Like all of those women whom I liked and with whom then nothing happened.

I wish I could remember if Kate was the first one to like my profile,
or if she liked me in reciprocity after I swiped her right first.
Does it matter?

I kept thinking today about that event at Café Cleopatra.
It's going to be the Friday before I leave Montréal—two weeks from now.

Anahí was the first one to tell me that her messages were clearly telling me
_not to call her, she'd be calling me_.
Monica, and Eliseo would later agree after the next raincheck—or three.
Even Armando would say that her reply was weird.
On the surface she talks about our next meeting,
but makes no effort about arranging it.

She's not interested enough to even reply to my messages.

Maybe she's just busy.
Alda was perceptive enough to guess she's dating other people.
Probably I am not ready to this kind of stuff.

_For having studied psychology, I suck at reading people.
I promise this is the last one before I finally get the hint.
Friday 10th, Café Cleopatra, a night of burlesque. What do you say?_

Monica would not agree.
She didn't agree with the first idea about sending her the second message
after her silence.
_Don't do that to yourself.
You deserve better, love_.

She's right, it would be humilliating.
Why should I be begging for attention?

Maybe I should listen to imaginary Monica.

I got another match in Bumble.
As soon as I saw the profile I sensed that if I swiped right,
it would be a match.

She looks cis.
I was going to write _so do I_, but of that idea I am not so sure.
It could be that that was the precise reason that Pascal had a
_good feeling about me_.

Tomorrow night I'll see if the 24 hours pass before a first message.

### Sunday, November 28th, 2021
"Vi varias chicas que sí me gustaron pero me siento muy _awkward_ acercándome.
Hubo una que sí me sonrió cuando pasaba, como dos o tres veces,
pero en mi cabeza había una voz que me decía que solo estaba siendo _nice_."

"Ay bebé, entiendo el _feeling_ pero no es así."

"No lo sé, bebé; ya sabes cómo son las morras blancas y güeras que se pasan de
_nice_"

I honestly thought that this other girl would let the timer go off and the
conversation die.
Last night at the bar,
whenever I felt the urge to see if Kate was online in Whatsapp,
I would open Bumble to make sure that the match was still there and, with it,
my question unanswered.

I wore jeans with a red, long-sleeved blouse.
I considered wearing the skirt even though, of course,
I had not intention of letting the french girl know that I was trying to keep
the dresses-and-skirts-on-winter fight on.

I think about her too much.
I hate it.

The night was white and cold.
I arrived early, 20 minutes before the doors would open.
The time we had agreed to meet.

Were it not for Kory, I wouldn't have had a good time.
I enjoyed his company.
I felt cared about and it was something new for me.

I haven't logged the expenses this past few days.
There's the wine and the ciders.
I ordered some food with Alda and got that Vodka bottle, too.

Armando said it was fine if I don't clean until tomorrow.
I am tired.

I need to buy food again.
Two weeks before I leave.
Maybe I should eat even less so I won't be a dysphoric mess at the beach.
The bottle of red wine lasted me almost as much as the bottle of Vodka that
other week.

I made a long turn when I saw there was a group of people at the entrance door.
I walked along the other way to make time.
The only thing I hate more than being in a group of people
is being inside a group of people when I know nobody.

Kory arrived at 22h.
Most of the people in the line were men.
It was the same for the rest of the night.
I would lie if I said wasn't expecting something like Club Unity.
I felt similarly to that night when I saw the guys hitting on Kory
while I was dancing awkwardly next to him.

The first girl I noticed was the brunette with a black mask.
I lost her halfway through the night.

There were a couple of others, but I don't remember them.

I remember the last one.
She was blonde with a red and black top.
She caught my glances and then smiled.
That happened maybe three or four times.

When I first started transitioning and being seen as a woman,
the first changes that I started noticing were that women would smile at me
when they saw me.
It was different to the smiles I would get when I started presenting as a
woman without necessarily being seen as one.
Those smiles were complicit, like getting into this secret joke.
When I started passing as something other than a queer person,
the smiles would be warm, sharing a sensation of belonging.

Were the smiles of this girl like those?,
was she just welcoming in the club of womanhood?
Or were they more like the formers, recognizing the queerness in me,
and reciprocating?

If she were interested, she didn't show it.
Women around here are too nice.

A couple of nights ago, when I bought the bottle of wine,
I asked Alda to share a joint.
We walked around the city and ordered some food on our way back.
She showed me another spot where she likes to smoke.
I took a picture in there of the lonely light through a fence.

Walking through Jeanne-Mance Park, I snapped a picture of the path.
I saved them in my phone without any intentions of using them for anything.

During the drag show at the bar,
I recorded 5 seconds of the performance thinking I could share the story but
decided against it.

I took two pictures of myself after putting my make up and I hated them both.
At the end, I wore neither my hair loose nor tied up.

Today I posted both the winter pictures on Instagram to see if they would be liked.

People liked them, but not the person I was hoping.

### Monday, November 29th, 2021
_Heey, this is Sofía.
I changed phone numbers last week and idk why I thought Whatsapp would
automatically tell my contacts.
Just realized it doesn't, lol.
You didn't send me anything these past few days, did you?_

"We, ngl, that's smooth." Said Armando.

It was a mistake, though.

The message still has only one checkmark next to it.
Even though she hasn't been online since 5 hours ago,
she didn't have the number previously,
and the fact that I can actually see when she was online all mean that she
hasn't blocked me, I am feeling anxious about it.

I turned off the alarm and stayed in bed until almost noon.
I did nothing productive the whole day.
Well, nothing related to my program anyway.
I did clean the apartment.

During the lab meeting, as Reza was presenting,
I kept thinking about sending or not the message to the two guys
I had matched with last night on Bumble.

Again, I felt tempted to raise my own self-esteem by enabling my profile to
be shown to guys and swipe a couple to the left and see who has liked me.
This time it didn't end there.
The first time I swiped right and it was a match.

I panicked.
In my head the match was a commitment,
a promise for something to happened and a betrayal to my own sexual identity.
I was caught red-handed in my own sexual temptation.
For a moment I didn't remember that I had the option of just ignoring it.
The nature of bumble gives me the freedom of sending the first message
or letting the match died.
It was the perfect setting to test waters.

And so, I continued.
The second swipe to the right was a match, as well.

There wasn't a third.

I sent the messages and turned the phone down.
Not much later, when I took the phone again I saw the exact moment when
one of the guys' names disappeared from the screen as it does when a match
is deleted.

He could have let it die in 24 hours. Instead, he rejected me.

Catching my own breath from the sucker punch to my sexual self-worth,
I deleted the second guy even before he had the chance to respond or
follow the other man's steps.

The last girl didn't reply to my last message.
I haven't replied to the first one.
I did not delete them, although I can't think of a reason why.
Maybe I will, soon.

Alda invited me to this event in her faculty of engineering.
The date is the same as the show in Cafe Cleopatra the following Friday—the
one I had kept in my head for inviting Kate.

Since it won't happen, I proposed that the two of us could go.
She can't, she has a shift that early morning.

I told Armando that I've been thinking about asking her directly whether
she wants to meet again or not.
I think about her mixed signals and feel annoyed at them,
even though I can clearly see myself that I am mostly annoyed at myself
for allowing me to be fooled by them.
I don't want her niceness or her pity.

She knows I am trans,
do I think she tries to not hurt my feelings because of it?

I thought he would mock me for being pathetic.
I was waiting for that kind of slap to the face that would force me to delete
her and move on.
Except I really wasn't, because then I would have asked Monica.
He, unlike she would have, told me to do it.

Alda did the same thing.

"Nothing to lose if you do, other than a bit of self-esteem.
It seems like you wanna do it, so why not?"

I was thinking about what to say.
Do I really want to?
I knew I would, again, feel these pair of hands grasping the insides of my
chest and making a fist around my lungs.

Why did I do it?

When I asked Armando for suggestions,
he proposed telling her I was myself and I had changed numbers before asking
her again to do something soon.

I laughed, of course she knew I had changed numbers.
Whatsapp notifies your contacts.

"No, it doesn't." He replied back, "it didn't notify me."

When I sent him the screenshot that Monica had sent me when I specifically
asked her, I saw how it was a message from my new number.

_Fuck, was he right?_

The idea both startled me and relaxed me, like two hands interlocking fingers.
It would mean that if she had sent me a message after Thursday,
I wouldn't have received it because it was sent to my previous number.

Maybe she did and thought *I* was the one ignoring her?
How funny would that be?

And by funny, I, of course, mean the exact thing that would make me not feel
like a piece of human waste.

I told Eliseo, right under a couple of messages where he told me to just
forget about her, about my recent discovery.
He shot it down.
Before the pieces of my crushed hope could hit the ground,
he sent me a picture of the notification he received on the old conversation
with the previous number where it states that I changed numbers and suggests
him to add me to his contacts.

_Oh, don't worry, I knew_, she might tell me tomorrow.

If she replies back at all, that is.

### Tuesday, November 30th, 2021
"Hey Sofia, I saw that, yeah.
I had written to check you could still see my messages, but yeah,
I think was writing at the wrong place...
How are you?"

I have a date tomorrow.
We agreed to meet for a coffee in the evening after job.
Her name is Marie-Line.

The girl from Bumble replied back after I thought she wouldn't.
The conversation kept going.
There's no date yet, but I am pretty sure that I could ask after her next
reply and I would meet her soon. Her name is Stephanie.

All day I kept archiving and looking at Kate's conversation waiting for
something to happen.
The _last seen online_ time stayed the same all morning.
When it finally changed, my message was still at the top.

It wasn't until after I arrived home from the groceries and from the
_dépanneur_ that I got a response.

I opened it while she was online.
She must have seen me there.
Still, I took a screenshot and sent it to Armando before writing anything.
The last message sent to Monica, I deleted it.

She was replying to me, after I asked her how she's been.
I wanted to tell her about these girls,
I need her to tell me how I am back on that same path that I crawled off from
months ago.
It was awful, it all started with me falling strongly for the false promise
of a french girl.
Then looking for a distraction in meetings with a bunch of strangers.
She'd see what I am noticing but don't dare to admit.

"Pretty sus." I wrote to Armando and he agreed.

It's bullshit.
Of course she didn't send me anything.
She was ignoring me.
I know it as well as Eliseo and Monica knew it.
I know it's bullshit, but it still tastes so sweet that
I've eaten it all completely.

I finished the 'Normal People' book last night.
I could not sleep.
It wasn't like those nights where I sleep in 15-20 minutes intervals.

I really did not sleep a bit.
At around 4h, I grabbed the kindle and started reading.
It was around 6h when the sun started to come out and I decided to get up
and shower.

I had a cup of coffee and watched something on the computer, although,
I honestly can't recall what it was.

I sent the e-mail to Louis asking him if he wanted to meet at the lab.
Outside the snow kept falling pretty strongly.
I added a sentence telling him we could meet later if he would not be going.
Instead he replied maybe a half an hour later with his free schedule.

I sat in his office when I got there.
I saw him work.
It motivated me a little bit to actually do some of my own work.
Still, because I haven't slept at all in more than 24 hours,
at around noon I felt like screaming and running.

Reza was in the office after I came back from Louis'.

I kept replying to Steph.
She's the girl from the US.
She studied her undergrad at McGill.
We talked about the library and books.

Last night I talked with Marie-Line,
she's the Canadian who's going to start her new job in a couple of weeks.
She works with human rights and I'll meet her tomorrow.

We exchanged numbers.
If I don't hear from her at around noon,
I should send her a message to confirm with my propositions for places.
We could go to the brunch place to which I didn't end up taking Kate.
They sell coffee and beers and food.
_Café Santropol_ is another good option that is also closer.

Steph could not reply back,
MarieLine could not answer my message tomorrow, and still I wouldn't care.

I am drunk with Vodka and the lies of a french woman.

"My friend told me about it Saturday and he said they have been promoting it a
lot. Deep down I was hoping I would see you there."

"Oh yes!
I really wanted to be there actually.
Oh, and I would have loved to see you there."

"I'll exchange you videos of the event if you tell me all about [it]
when I see you"

"She wrote that", she sent with a picture of a book titled:
_I hope we choose love: a trans girl's notes from the end of the world_.
"I'll send you a podcast she spoke on that I loved.

"Deal", she ended quoting my proposal,
signing it with an emoticon surrounded by hearts.
Had I been the one who sent it, Monica wouldn't have approved.

"You got it. I'll wait for it!"
I continued talking about the podcast she offered.
"I promise I won't change numbers again."

"Hopefully not!" She finished,
with almost the exact last words the computer scientist spoke
before disappearing.

## December, 2021

### Wednesday, December 1st, 2021
"Let me know if you want to do something again."

I should try to connect my headphones to the laptop.
I know I will be able to, that there shouldn't be any problem,
yet I don't really want to.

I'm sitting in the dinning table with the laptop.
I'm waiting for Alda to get in.
Maybe she will ask me about my date.

She sent me a message after I mentioned to her that I had a headache so
I wouldn't follow my own idea of asking Marie-Line if she wanted to change
the coffees for beers.
She told me to let her know it would go.

What do I want to tell her?

I mean, about the date.
I do have something I want to tell her,
but I keep hesitating.
Every day I doubt more and more that I will eventually do it.

Last night we went to Café Cleopatra.
This time we arrived on time and so we got to pretty good seats.
They weren't the best, but the view was great.
I didn't take any pictures or video.
I don't know why, but I had this sensation that, as soon as I would,
the performers would stop their act, turn to me, and ask me firmly to stop
recording.
It felt like I would be invading their privacy.

_Sorry that I let you down,
but I didn't take any photos or videos of the show.
I can make it up to you in some other way, if you want_.

Sonny just asked me what I was doing.
I sent her a picture of me eating chips and, when she shot the question again
asking me where I **was**, then I evaded with the answer of _going for chips_.

Then, without any need, I told her that I had gone out.
I added that I probably wouldn't hear from her again so
she would both know what I was referring to and have the consolation that
nothing happened nor would.

Will the québécoise girl do it, though?
Let me be forgotten as a one date thing?
This is another entry into my long list of failed first dates.

Monica seems to think that I am bi.

"¿Cree? Porque yo lo sé", replied Sonny when I told her.

Am I, though?
I mean, I almost wanted to kiss Pascal—Francisco's friend from around here.
Every man that I kissed I didn't really enjoy it.
Then again, when I was kissing Sofía and Ytzel, it was fun and all, sure,
but it wasn't that special either.

I just sent the message that I wrote for Vicky—but didn't send—to Monica,
asking for her opinion.
I worry that it could be read as flirty, or maybe even creepy.
It probably does.
I won't send it.
Monica will soon agree.

I got a message from Marie-Line last night when I was at Café Cleopatra.

Isn't that what I wanted, that kind of attention?
Maybe she was just trying to agree on today.

Before that, I was showing Alda the conversation with Kate.
She didn't know why she would be lying about it.
She agreed that maybe she likes the attention.

Today, talking with Monica, I said how I can clearly see she's leading me on,
but maybe I like the attention, too.

I didn't do anything productive today.
No progress whatsoever.

I sent the first message to the québécoise woman.
She replied to me fairly quickly during her lunch break.
We agreed to meet on _Café Parvis_ at 18h.

I got there 5 minutes earlier and waited for her.
The conversation was nice.
She remembered stuff from my profile in the app and made questions accordingly.
Again, I said I had a brother and a sister.
She has a twin sister.
She studied geography, has a master's and has lived all over the place;
South America, Africa.
She's visited Mexico and Europe.
She's franco-canadienne.

I told Alda that, like all the rest, I liked her fine,
but wouldn't be too hurt if we didn't go out again.

"Oh that means you're not interested", she interpreted.

I guess I am not.

Even now, instead of thinking about where we could go next,
I keep coming back to the thought about when would be the appropriate time to
send another message to Kate.

I hate it. I hate it so much.

Marie-Line is older than me; she's looking for something serious and stable.
She was the first one to send a message and looked me up last night.

Although, if I were into her as much as Kate,
it would hurt way more when I eventually won't hear from her again.

### Thursday & Friday, December 2nd-3rd, 2021
"Te sigue dando largas bien cabrones;
y tú bien _simp_ de 'porfis ghosteame'"

"You're very pushy, too.
It freaks people out.
Si fuera yo diría _que insistente, que hueva..._"

The saddest thing is that I went to sleep last night with a smile in my face
and even my sheets smelled fresh and sweet. Nothing changed between then and
the morning. Now I'm feeling more blue than these past few days.

They are not wrong.
They never were.
Why is it so hard for me to notice these kind of things?

What would Marie-Line have said if she **didn't** really want to meet again?
I keep thinking back to it, and probably it would have been the same thing.

Kate was the one that used the phrase that I said last night.
But I sent her the message almost immediately.
Am I really this famished for attention?

Will I hear from her again?
Deep down I have this familiar idea that if I don't say or send anything,
she'll just disappear.
Even Sonny did when I didn't follow up the first time we talked.

Today I saw another french girl in Bumble.
I had matched with her on the other app, so I decided to send her a message.
What could I lose?

She replied back fairly quickly as well.
Why didn't the first ones then?
It wasn't then something with the app.
We kept talking and chatting in the morning.
She's a data engineer working at a bank.
She's French and Canadian.
She grew up the first years of her life in a village close to Paris.

This time I was more confident and less attached.

At noon I closed the conversation telling her that I had enjoyed it, but
I had to go back to my work.
I left her with the open invitation to hit me up later to continue chatting
or maybe even meet sometime.

She replied back instantly that she would.
Do I understand french, though?
She has no problem writing in English, but speaking is another issue.

I lied in French telling her that because her accent, I assume, is French,
I might find it easier.

We kept talking after my meeting with Louis for a little bit, but neither of
use made no mention of meeting soon.
Maybe we won't.
We probably won't.

I sent a message to Eliseo asking him if he'd be free tonight.
Last night I sent him a message for some reason and he brought up having
another call.
He was at work, though.

I feel down.
I feel that I'll keep meeting and repulsing people all over again.
I'm the girl of the thousand first dates.

Steph replied me just now with an even longer message.

With Louis, once again, I talked about work and made some questions that
would hide the real progress that I haven't made.
He must be realizing now how I'm faking it.
I'm sure he does.
How could he not?

Anka sent an e-mail today about how she reserved a hall for the meetings
of the lab for next year.
The first one will be the 10th.

I will probably need to purchase my return flight before that date.

Last night Kate gave me a date.
That was what Armando had said,
_when someone's interested in you but can't meet,
the less they do is propose another date_.

After the 13th she'll be finished with her tests,
she'll have time to see me more.

More?

I thought I was being flirty and charming, but I probably came off too
strong—again—and repulsive.

_Eres feo, acéptalo, tío_.

Marie-Line looked at her phone and was surprised by the time.
The date was just two hours.
Maybe she thought it would be way later.
No, she made a mention how _of course_ she would be hungry.

She brought back the bit of info in my profile about my social skills.
That was after I confessed to her that I hadn't actually understood what
the waitress had told me in French.

I won't hear from her again.
Alda told me that I probably I wasn't that interested.

Why am I hurt, then?

I deleted Kate's conversation.

I wanted to remember who had sent the last messages, but it was surely me.
It's always me.
The last, again, went unanswered.
No, I answered her question and that was it.

She said she would think about meeting that Friday before my departure.
Of course she wanted to see me before I leave.
**Of course**.

She would do her best.

I'll probably never see her again in my life.


### Saturday, December 4th, 2021
"Alors, est-ce que tu veux qu'on se rencontre bientôt?
J'ai besoin de pratiquer mon francais;
and Duolingo doesn't have a module on french kissing"

_So, how was your book event?
[...]
I feel a little conflicted.
I want to see you very much,
but I'm also a bit afraid that I've been coming off as too pushy.
I worry that you're too nice with me and just don't know how to tell me_ no.

Like yesterday, this morning when I woke up I saw in my phone
two unexpected notifications.

Last morning, after I had deleted Kate's conversation,
she came back replying to my last messages about my trip to Mexico.
She ended with a question asking me if I was going to keep using the same
number for Whatsapp.

Does that mean she intends to keep in touch?
Why is it so hard to take her at face value with her statement that she does
want to see me before I leave?

Anahí, like Alda, doesn't really believe she's just blowing me off.
After Alda saw that last message, she commented how she does want to see me,
albeit with a warning that she might be leading me on.

In any case, I replied back with three—too long—text messages that, again,
have gone unreplied.
And, again, too, I have deleted the conversation trying to appease myself
with the fantasy that, by not seeing the messages,
I can fool myself into believing that they never happened.

Last night, in a desperate try to distract myself,
I looked up the latest french girl.
I sent her a message asking her what was she up to this weekend.
She replied in the same way that I replied to the Canadian girl, Marie-Line.
She was at a Karaoke, so she apologized beforehand if she couldn't reply to me
that much.

I asked her about her song plans.
She said she sings like an 8 year old.
That could be the cutest or the most hilarious thing ever,
and as such I told her—later this morning, I would confess to her how I have
the opposite problem with my voice being the one of an adult man.
I said, too, that maybe today I'd be going out with my roommates.

We didn't, though. We probably won't.

Armando told me how he wasn't feeling like going out, specially because of the cold.
Perhaps he'd be up to doing something here, in the apartment.
I sent a message to the group asking them, but no one have replied.
The phone just beeped when I was typing the last paragraph.
It could be one of them cancelling.

"Well, have fun then...", said Alix ending the conversation.
And with that, I closed it.

This morning she picked it up to let me know how it was fun until it wasn't.

Just like me with the rest of my first dates, I suppose.

A couple of nights ago I had a videcall with Eliseo.
I told him about my change of heart with the last—then—messages from Kate.
I confessed to him how I had been too pushy and needy.

_What is wrong with me?_
I asked him without exactly saying it.

He looked at me with sympathy and told me how he doesn't believe it.
I'm just so vulnerable right now and going through something,
that it might look like that.
Perhaps it's not the right moment for me to be looking out for this kind of
encounters.
His words felt warm in my chest and pushed out some tears that I had been
holding for a couple of days.

After enjoying his conversation,
I suggested to Sonny to have a videocall of our own.

After the teams meeting with the lab,
they'd be turning off the computers until Monday and because of that I would
have the perfect reason to give myself a break during the weekend.

I went to the _dépanneur_ to get myself some alcohol and chips.

We talked about her dates and mine.
She told me how she'd be going out with someone,
someone with whom she might try it out.
They're this non-binary person, but she didn't make no mention of it to me.
I was sincerely excited for her.

There was a bit of nervousness within me that I'd fooled myself into believing
I'm actually OK with this.
Later, when I saw Sonny's story I didn't feel nothing at first.
Then, I felt relieved that they were less attractive to me *in my own eyes*.

Monica went out with Leonel yesterday, too.
Would Catherine, perhaps, be going out on a date of her own?
Anahí told me that she didn't.

This morning Monica told me he took her to his house and
they kissed and kissed and kissed.
She didn't let him go further because she hadn't shaved.

Rather than jealousy,
I was worried that Monica's messages would awake envy in me.
I'm not sure if they did.

### Sunday, December 5th, 2021
"I'm thinking of you"

"You sound stupid and you're not stupid.
Because you'll keep sending her _risky_ messages because you're
_never going to see her, anyway_ and then she'll either block you or
she'll write something nasty about how sick she's of you and block you
and you'll end up hurt.

"Mandas mensaje ebria y te agüitas _over and over_.
Las que te encuentran atractiva las mandas lejos: Alice, Minas [...]
Justo ahorita me haces pensar que tal vez [...]
creo que tú tienes un type porque *tú* quieres ser ese type.
You want to look like them."

The last time I got this drunk and high,
I ended up being blocked by the first french girl.
I have the opportunity of setting up a meeting with one and
received—yet another—void promise of meeting to other one.

I was sincere when I told Monica how,
when Kate replied to me to my last message without being obviously freaked out,
instead of feeling cheerful to put an end to this,
I was melancholically disappointed.

We didn't order food but I drank with them.
We had fun; or at least I did.
They didn't as much as I did.
Alda had only one drink and Armando maybe two.
I had two cans of wine cooler and almost an entire bottle of rosé.
I smoked with Alda outside a full joint and half of a second one.

Once during the night I specifically told them to keep my phone away from me
because I was aware of the urge to send something that would surely ruin
every possible chance with any of the girls with whom I had been chatting.

I sent a corny and stupid message to the Chinese girl.

I invited playfully to practice my French with Alix, the third french girl.
I didn't want her to reply to me last night.
I don't think I wanted her to reply at all.

In her first reply she switched to French,
given I had just told her I wanted to practice.
She said we could, and both asked me what I was expecting from the app and
warned me that she wasn't ready to do anything sex-related.
She wasn't closed to the idea, but no.

In the humorous mood of the night, Alda told me to ask her how to
say _friendzone_ in French.
Monica's comments about it from this morning made me both regret it and
feel disgusted with myself.
The french woman answered me and then repeated how that wasn't really the
case.
She wasn't close to the idea and, if it happened, all the best,
but it wasn't her goal.

I didn't reply back after that and kept drinking and chatting.
An hour later, maybe, she sent another text in English asking me,
if she hadn't made me run away, what plans I had if we were to go out?

Alda and Armando, with our very beginner's French read her as changing her
mind and actually being interested.
Monica, who's way more experienced with the language, saw it as she rejecting me.

Why would she want to go out in that case?
I deleted the match of Pascale without replying.
I didn't tell them vague promises of meeting them soon.

At 1h Armando went to his room and I got very conscious of how drunk I really
was.
At one point in the night I told them how I had trans friends that do use
Grindr.
Now they must suspect about me.

Alda suggested me to send a _fuckboy_-ish message to Kate.
She hadn't said anything about my last messages and actually seeing her again
seemed like a childish hope so I agreed.

I deserve to be blocked.
That's the consequence of foolishly getting my hopes up.

She didn't block me.
Instead, she viewed and replied to each one of my messages—quoting them as if
she known that I had deleted the conversation and was making me the favour of
showing them back again.

The first ones had exclamation marks and emojis.
Again she told me that, _yes, with pleasure_ would she like to look me up and/or
receive picture of Mexico's beach.
Maybe she was replying to the messages as she was reading them.
The last message she sent—where she was quoting the one I had sent just hours
before at 1h40—didn't have any excitement or emotion.

It started with a lie and then continued with the same empty promise.

"Me too.
I'm going to tell you as soon as I can,
for if we can find a time to see each other before you leave."

_Sofia vraiment aime le pain français._

_Quel pain français? #1, #2, #3_

I'm home from the lab.
The apartment is empty.
I left in the morning shortly after Armando.
On my way there, he sent me a message warning me to be careful with the grey ice.
I haven't fallen once in the almost whole year that I've been here.
I should probably walk with my hands out of my pockets.

I have taken my lenses out.
We were supposed to go see Dune in theaters today,
but the plans were cancelled in the end.
Tomorrow I'll see Calli.
I guess I won't waste my lenses.
I don't plan to go back to the lab.
Alda suggested we could see it tomorrow,
maybe here in the apartment to not spend more money.

Last night, while I was fantasizing about what I could say to Kate
after she answers back, I thought about her projector.
Perhaps I could invite her to come over and watch something.

She hasn't replied back.
Probably tomorrow, if she does.
I wouldn't blame her if I won't hear from her again.
Monica's right.
I'll freak her out soon—if she's not lost interest already.

Yesterday I sent three messages.
The first one was a summary of responses to her first batch of replies.
In the second one—the most pathetic one—I questioned her _me too_, asked her
to follow on with her offer of finding a time to meet,
and finished with a clumsy attempt of doing what Monica suggested,
but crossing the line into what Armando told me explicitly not to do:
a passive and indirect statement about how I sometimes worry that she's
just being too nice.
The last one was a shitty way of continuing the conversation by
asking her how her book event had gone.

I'm feeling worse and worse with this conversation.
I lost count of how many times I went in there to check if she had replied back.
Archiving the conversation is useless now.
When I got home, I deleted it again.
This is the third time that I do it.

I had a match with yet another woman on Her.
She even started the conversation.
Even though I wanted to ignore her, I didn't.
I replied to her message thinking about the frustration of not getting
anything whenever I try to start a conversation.
She didn't continue it so I let it die.

I haven't taken the offer of the third french girl about meeting at the bar
she suggested with a jukebox.
Maybe what I am feeling right now about her is what the second one feels
about going out with me.

What will I tell Calli tomorrow?
I could tell her about Eliseo's conversation and understanding.
Armando and Monica's comments hurt me.
I don't know how to socialize.
I studied psychology and I feel lost wandering through first dates and
unreplied messages.
All of the people I show the messages have different readings about Kate.
How am I supposed to know what's going on?

Ask her, I guess.

I wondered about telling Alda, finally.
Don't mess around the issue or lose time with related questions, just say it.
The questions and explanations would come after.
They would surely come later.
I wanted to tell her before I'd meet Calli tomorrow.
I won't see her until next year, after I come back from Mexico.

I grabbed my phone and for a minute was surprised to see the notifications
on the screen, but they were Monica's.
She laughed at the picture I sent her of the whiteboard in the fridge.
After sending it, I worried that she would correct our french grammar.
In the morning, I told her that I haven't forgotten about how she hasn't
told me about her date.

Deep down I wish she'd have some drama so I wouldn't feel like I take over
our conversations with my issues.

To whom haven't I talked with about this french girl with
*whom I've gone on only one date*?

That's not fair.
We've been texting for a month.
This is the longer I've been talking with anyone that I've dated.
The only other girl with longer _history_ would be Molly, but ironically,
I didn't even go out with her.
I didn't even talk with her afterwards;
everything's been in my head and in interactions with other people.

She probably doesn't even think of me.

"I'm thinking of you", I confessed to Kate on that drunken night.

Why would she lie that she does, too?

"Hoy sí me caí"

Calli suggested today, after noticing how, once again,
I feel stuck in the middle between two opposing forces,
that I could imagine how it would be to actually move in any direction.
It doesn't matter how little, I should write it down somewhere and let me
know that it's OK to do whatever that action is and feel whatever feelings
come with it.
That is how we ended our last session of the year.
We're not seeing each other until I return from Mexico.

I browsed the flights and realized that now most of them have long and tedious
layovers.
It will be very hard taking into consideration the now testing requirements.
I sent a message to my mum that I'll be buying the tickets soon.
I probably should do that today.

I sent Sonny a message admitting that I'm not feeling very good at the moment.
I've given up entirely the idea of actually doing something productive for the
rest of the day.
I can fool myself into thinking that the bug I caught yesterday would take me
easily a full day before fixing it, and thus, having an appropriate excuse for
the work that I won't do today.

I asked Sonny if it was OK for me to start drinking right now.
Last night I went to the _dépanneur_ in the freezing rain to get myself a bottle
of wine.
There's still half of it left.
I told her I'd wait fifteen minutes until 17h.
I'll break my own promise.

I like talking about the french girls because mentioning them makes them real.
The drunk message I sent in the middle of the night got a reply, her last.
It didn't make me feel what I would have expected.

It's not true.
That wasn't her last.
I sent her a message in response to one of her stories in Instagram.
She immediately started typing a response.
_I answer either immediately or take forever_,
she warned me after the first time I asked her out.

I grabbed my phone and, instead of deleting her contact or blocking her like
Calli suggested in her example,
I just disabled the _last seen_ feature of Whatsapp.
That may dissuade me from opening her contact compulsively to see if she has
gotten in recently.

I shared with Calli how I hate how much I still think of her.
It's pathetic the amount of thoughts I spend on women that most likely
literally forget about my existence.
I panicked the moment I saw the Brazillian girl walking downtown when
were she to see me she most probably wouldn't have even recognized me.

Is it impossible for her to reject me because of _cis-guilt_?
Monica disagrees.

I sent a reply to Alix, the following french woman.
The conversation died on her end.
I should leave it like that.

Perhaps Kate doesn't suggest a time to meet because she's hoping to meet
someone more interesting or attractive than me.
Maybe it's not that she's avoiding my messages but she literally forgets about
them.
What would make me feel worse?

I could work right now on Calli's assignment.
On one way I could delete her contact.
Blocking her would be too much.
I'd be doing exactly what Flore did.
I mean, not exactly, but pretty close.
The right thing would be to be direct and tell her that I am annoyed by the
mixed signals and I would be deleting her.
I clearly don't want to do that.

The other option is the message that I wrote down in the notepad of my phone
as a draft.
Another direct message sharing what I really feel.

_Honestly, I am starting to regret not asking to kiss you when we said our
good-byes_.

It is true.
It is what I feel and think; just like the message at 1h.
I like her other replies—the hearty emojis and the excitement of the more
subtle messages where I tell her that I could do something to make up from
the pictures I didn't take, or to send her pictures of the beach—,
but the last one feels false, condescending.

This one would be direct, no more reading between the lines.
No more hiding in ambiguity or vagueness.

It could also be creepy.
Specially after the last one.

Would I really like seeing her again if nothing comes out of it, though?
Were she to tell me how she's not interested romantically—no, sexually in
me—would I still want to see her?

Maybe the text is not so bad, then.

### Wednesday, December 8th, 2021
"I'm feeling a bit selfish and actually considering sending you another flirty
text tonight to bump my conversation up"

"I thought you'd take the metro with me because you lived a bit far so
I didn't think you'd walk home, but now that you say that,
I didn't know it was an option, I regret that"

Yesterday Monica asked me—she invited me—to vent to her what I didn't say the
night before.
I told her how the last girl had looked me up again and invited me to go out
and, suddenly, I lost interest again.

Calli faked a sound of realization when I told her about Monica's insight.
Is it, though?

Monica's right, I'm acting over-fixated with this.
Even though today was actually one of the _most_ productive days I've had in a
while, I haven't stopped thinking about these girls.
I'm not a teenager, even if I'm as horny as one because of the antidepressants.

Am I, though, or I've taken it as another excuse for my behaviour?

I have been feeling differently.
It's not all in my imagination.

Yesterday I ordered pizza trying to lift my mood a bit.
I drank the wine from the day before and became over-conscious of the urges I
was feeling to contact Kate again.
I had disabled the _seen_ information of my messages and the _last seen online_ so
I didn't know if she had seen my previous messages asking her about the event.
I kept thinking about the message I sent her the weekend.
Her message different from the rest.

A part of me wanted to push it even more.
In the notes of my phone I had this draft of a message telling her that I
regret not kissing her.

Instead of writing it, I just teased it playfully.
I couldn't even continue the message with the second half,
when she replied back instantaneously.

I backtracked almost as fast as she responded when she apologized for not
replying by explaining the stressful situation she is currently in.
She doesn't have a visa at the moment so she is not allowed to work.
She has more than a hundred unpaid hours of labour.
No shit she wouldn't be replying to my stupid messages.

I apologized and tried to uselessly offer her any help.
How could I—literally a stranger she's met only once for a couple of hours—help
her in any significant way?

We chatted for the longest time since we talked that day.
Now I think how I could have made a mention of my desire to open up with Alda.
That could ameliorate my irrational fear that she doesn't really know about my
trans history.
Instead we talked about my post-therapy self-care, falling on the ice,
and, finally, the flirtatious message that I mentioned earlier.

When I teased her telling her that I could save it for next time,
she took the opportunity to explain herself in feeling overwhelmed and taking
her time to respond.
Even if she wouldn't reply at the time,
she does feel touched and smiley and happy with messages that she gets excited
about.

Has she ever gotten that way from messages that I've sent?
When I asked her, she replied with a yes in all caps.

I offered her to act even more flirtatious when I eventually meet her this week,
knowing full well that it's not going to happen.
I said then that if we don't get to meet,
I'd send her messages all the time so she wouldn't forget about me until my
return.

She laughed too much at the idea and agreed;
she'd give me all the attention that she's terrible at giving me in the phone.
Of course she wouldn't forget about me, she concluded.

Before leaving, I sent her the message.
One hour later precisely she saw it.

It was another _me too_.

In the morning I told Alda through texts and she had the same reaction that
she and Abby had on the balcony of club Unity.
I saw it, and starting it doubting it myself.

Was she expecting me to come with her?
Instead of staying with the doubt myself,
I sent her a message before noon asking her directly.
This time she replied pretty quickly.

It wasn't that. It's just what I knew happened.
Instead of leaving it like that, though, she went further.

I haven't heard from her since.
Only Armando and Alda know about this exchange.
I sent the pictures to Anahí but deleted them right after.
I told Monica without any details of what happened,
and she was annoyed that I'm still obsessed with this.
She's not wrong.
I won't say anything to Eli nor Sonny.
I should keep this.

It's been hard not proposing her outright to go out again this weekend.
I thought waiting until tomorrow evening.

Maybe I should just not say anything.
I'm already assuming it's not going to happen.
She knows I'll be leaving on Monday.
She knows I want to kiss her.
She knows hooking up is up in the air.
If she really wants it to happen,
even if it's just a fraction of how much *I* want it, she can look me up.

### Thursday, December 9th, 2021
"Idk we, por más risa que me da como la cagas una y otra vez,
como que sí me quedo de _no mames, Sofía_, agarra el pedo.
Es el mismo error una y otra vez.
¿Me explico? Y ya estás _Ruffles_."

"Sorry if I come [off] too pushy, I just got this e-mail.
So yeah, last chance.
I know it's not the best time with your exams and everything,
so I understand if you don't feel like it, but maybe the distraction would help.
It'd be my treat of course.
Anyway, no pressure, you let me know."

The sale ends in half an hour.

Most probably, I won't hear from her by then.
I might not hear from her until tomorrow.
Maybe later at night.

I know she's busy.
I know she doesn't reply quickly.
It's a weekday.
She's not that interested.

_No way, she's def flirty_.

I don't know.
The timing is not right.
A couple of weeks away might help me in more ways than one.

If she does reply, will I tell her that the sale ends if she denies the
invitation?
Will I ask her to clarify her feelings about me?
The times have changed, I know why she feels tired and stressed out.

I shouldn't make things about me, even though that is what I do most of the time.

I asked Alda if I haven't annoyed her like I have Armando and Monica.

"Es que no tienes otra plática", said earlier Monica.

Alda, instead, was nice and kind.
She enjoys hearing about this.

I invited her to go to this event Saturday's afternoon organized by
Queer McGill.
I'm not even sure I want to go,
but, in case Kate rejects me like she usually does,
the distraction would ease my mind.

I woke up early in the morning.
I turned off the alarm at 8h15, but I didn't get back to sleep.

The Wellness Hub starts receiving calls at 8h30,
so I took the opportunity to sort out my appointment with Dr Perera.
While I waited for them to take my call,
the thought came to my mind that there's only tomorrow and Monday's morning
before my departure.

The sooner appointment they could give me was the 14th.
I could have lied and taken the call at Sonny's house,
but instead came clean and told the receptionist that wouldn't work for me.
I'll call next year when I get back to Canada.

I also called the bank to figure out the prepaid card.
While I fixed the PIN issue, I still am not able to reload funds.

I asked Alda for some Adderall.
I have been working on Qrater and the abstract for OHBM.
She gave me three long-release pills.
I saved one and took the rest.
That wasn't the smartest idea.
Although I did manage to get some work done, after noon,
I felt even more disperse than usual.

For a minute I was worried that Louis would notice in our meeting.
He might have.
I was way more energetic and talkative.
He probably realized something was going on,
but I'm sure he just settled on the thought that I was in a good mood.

I keep glancing at my phone waiting for an answer.
It's 50/50—if even that—that she's just going to say no again.
Was it this morning when I doubted that she had wanted me to come over?

No, those were the last messages we exchanged last morning.
Now I'm starting to worry that conversation is the issue that's going to freak
her out.
Instead of my incessant pushiness, which is what everyone else
has been telling me.

Even after Alda told me she enjoys listening to my stories—she once said how
she feels like living vicariously through me—,
I did not tell her that I asked her out again.

She would probably approve.
I mean, she'd have done it differently, waiting for her to do the next move,
but she's definitely flirty so, what's the deal?

Calli told me that I should accept the things that I want to do or say.
Eliseo said something similar, punishing myself for being too needy or clingy,
for sending those messages, or for looking her up is not the best way to go.

Had I not dared to send the last _risky_ message the other night,
we wouldn't have talked for an hour or exchanged the last messages that made
me feel like a teenager again.

Yeah, I felt embarrassed when Armando said that I am too old for this shit.
But, honestly, I enjoyed it.
Which even now as I'm writing it, is a bit embarrassing on itself.

### Friday, December 10th, 2021
"Does that mean I'll get to see you before I leave?
I'm literally dreaming about you now; brunch, dinner, just make out.
Let's celebrate!"

What was the message that started it last night?

No, it started at noon with my invitation.
I justified my actions thinking that she's going through stressful stuff right
now and maybe telling her that the sale was off would ease her from the
anxiety that comes with saying no.

Although, she's been saying no for the last handful of times;
she must be an expert by now.

I projected my own struggles unto her as I remembered the few times that I've
been invited to stuff yet didn't have the courage to tell them no.
Karina's message for Vix's dinner, the invitation to the bar by Alix,
Kory telling me he was downtown.

The phone just glowed and I immediately stretched my neck to catch the colors
of the emoticon that appeared next to her name in the notification.

The last _risky_ text was more than an hour ago.
She hasn't been online since a couple of minutes after that.
I turned that feature off even before she looked me up in the afternoon.

She has been a bit different these past few nights.
Hopefully I didn't ruin it.

Last night I sent her a message telling her about my social anxiety rejecting
invitations and then offered her the new information that the tickets had run
out.

She replied immediately after appearing online just after she received
my notification.
She didn't take the out I gave her and instead rejected me anyway.
_She wouldn't be able to make it, either way._

I started one of the drafts I had in my notes,
but because I didn't complete it with the corny second half,
it might just had came off passive-aggressive,
as I told her that it might have been for the best.

Just because she had started typing before that message I know her
explanation about her COVID scare was not an offering of peace after that
defensiveness.

We talked for a bit less than an hour.
This time there wasn't much flirting, at least not from her end.

I shared with her that the time that I had my own COVID scare
the results had arrived 12 hours after the test.
She asked me how long ago this was.
I told her the part that I was intentionally leaving out about it being just
after our date.

I jokingly told her that I was scared of having to contact-trace her because
she would had hated me for it.
She just laughed it off and denied the idea.

"I mean you say that *now* after I've charmed you with my clingy messages."

She laughed in a different way and ended with an emoticon that I didn't
know exactly how to read.

The conversation ended uneventfully.
I confessed that I had considered her asking her to update me about her results,
but, because she had a lot on her mind, she shouldn't worry.

"I like having an excuse for reaching out", I added unnecessarily.

"Perfect then", was her last message with a happy face as a sentence bookend.

I started typing something, but deleted it.

She might have saw it on her end, but if she did, she said nothing about it.

Last night—was it before or after sending the peace offering about my
invitation?—I touched myself until completion.
It took me way more than other times, but it was also different.
There was some wetness in the sheets and my body was completely exhausted after.
Still, it didn't help me to sleep.

I woke up around 4h or 5h in the morning and just stayed in bed.
I started sending memes and images to several people.
The first one was Alda after seeing her lights turned on.
I sent a couple to Armando, and then some to Monica and Sonny.
Around 6h I posted a story on Instagram with the full intention of seeing if
and how long it'd take Kate to see her.

I fell asleep shortly after and woke up from a sensation-dream where I was
texting her in french.

I had the perfect excuse to send her another message this afternoon and I
blew it to tell her about my creepy dream.

If she doesn't reply back and I never see her again, at least—unlike with the
computer scientist—I'll know precisely why it happened.

She didn't reply nor say anything.

All day I've been thinking about her—what to say and if I'll get to see her
again this weekend.
It actually worries me.

I've been working more than other days and that helps a bit.
At 18h I considered sending her the question about the results after seeing
her online.
Not much after, I got a notification from her telling me the results were
negative.

I ignored the drafts that I had written following Calli advice and
instead I improvised a response.

It's 20h and she hasn't answered.
The invitation for today's show was around this time and she said she wouldn't
make it.

I'm thinking about backpedalling, saying I'm only joking around.
Maybe telling her that I don't want to annoy her or creep her out.
Why should I?
The message I sent is exactly what I feel and want.
I want to see her, take her out to eat or maybe even just kiss.
Why am I feeling this guilty and dirty about it?

After I sent the image to Alda with the caption telling her that maybe this is
what would get me blocked,
I realized that it's pretty mild compared to what we talked before.
We mentioned kissing.
She said she regretted it,
after realizing there was an option for inviting me to her place.
For fuck's sake, on her description she explicitly lists _having sex_ as
a potential activity.

I know why this bothers me.
It's because I associate it with manliness.
Because I am, again, asking her and waiting for a rejection.
I am risking coming off as predatory.
I feel vulnerable.

On the other hand, this is the first time the whole day that,
after thinking she will probably deny my invitation,
I sincerely think it wouldn't be that hard to not send her a message until I
leave.

### Saturday, December 11th, 2021
"Yesterday I thought about telling you how I was starting to like waiting for
your replies, but, ngl, right now I am feeling a little nervous. Just a bit."

Still nothing.
She might not reply back?
I honestly don't think this will be the last I hear from her.
It well could possibly be, but I really don't believe it.
Probably tomorrow, perhaps Monday, she will ask me if I have left yet and
will apologize for not getting back to me.

That's, of course, if I can manage to have a sense of willpower and not
send her *another* thing.

It's getting easier, though.
I cracked last night and sent her something else with the hopes that it would
break the silence, but instead of coming up as charming, it was cringe-y.

It, in fact, could be for the best.
I, again, went too strong too quickly.
At least after that Friday in the club and her date,
I know that people can be attracted to me,
whether after a first glance or a first meeting.

On the other hand,
the girl at the club could have left after realizing I was trans,
and all of Kate's dance of flirtatious messages were just keeping me on the
side as an available option in case any of her other prospects didn't pan out.

Am I as hideous as I see myself?

I well could had gone to the McGill Queer meeting at Atwater Market.
I woke up early, I got up at a good enough time.
I had no plans.
I didn't go.
I didn't really want to.

I haven't bought Sonny's beanie she asked me nor any of the souvenirs I
thought of getting.
I showered moments ago, but instead of wearing clothes considering going out
to get the stuff, I put on loungewear again.

Last night the phone started vibrating and I grabbed it thinking it was the
apology for not being able to meet me that I was expecting.
It was Armando's.
I asked him yesterday again about what mistake he was referring to with the
full intention of delving into the subject of my missing experiences being a
normal teenage girl.

_You see, I honestly thought you at least suspected it, but I don't know anymore.
I didn't grow up as a normal girl.
I didn't grow up as a girl at all.
There's a lot of stuff that I didn't learn until way later;
even some that I haven't learned at all._

He avoided the subject and I just let it go.

The same notification missexpectation happened this morning,
but it was Alda's.
I sent her a message—was it even before she texted me?—that I didn't feel like
going to Atwater.
We talked about doing something today or tomorrow night before my departure.

Why does Kate not want to see me?
I mean, that's not the part that I can't understand.
Why would I believe she would?

The last time she was on Whatsapp was after midnight.
She hasn't gotten in since.

I posted a meme about the conversation in Spanish with Sonny about the meme
and the picture of me in underwear.
Not even 2 minutes later, the only viewers were Alda and her.
I took a screenshot of that and sent it to Alda.

I wanted to tell Monica, but held it in.
I don't think she wants to hear anything more about this whole issue.
Could it have something to do with us being exes?
No, I don't really think so.

I posted another one before showering,
but she wasn't in the first people that viewed it.

After I saw her in that list, I deleted both of them.

A couple of nights ago she asked me again how I've been doing after I posted
my own conversation with Armando telling me I wasn't that good.
It was in Spanish.
I don't really believe she would translate it,
but Marie-Line told me how for francophones it's pretty easy to get Spanish
from context.
I personally know how it's even easier when it's written.

Later in the conversation, when she was apologizing and thinking how I must be
all stressed that she was seeing my messages but not replying,
she mentioned that she struggles even if it doesn't seem like it on Instagram.
Could that be related as well?

I honestly doubt she's even close to being as obsessed as me,
so I don't really think she'll make any notice about my deleted stories just now.

I should not send her anything anymore.
If she does reply back—which, again, she probably will—, will I answer back?
Will I be direct and tell her that I am confused by the mixed signals?
Will I ask her if she wants me to back off?
Or if she honestly wants to see me?

Does it even matter? At least for another month, I won't.

I saw her once, and yet I feel a little hurt by the idea of not seeing her again.
I deserve it, it's all my fault.
Not really for sending those messages,
but for letting myself get this invested in the first place.

### Tuesday, December 14th, 2021
I'm typing these words outside the 750words website.
I am aboard the plane going to Mexico City.
Today, it was a good day.

Last night, Sunday, I did not complete the words.
The opportunity was there; I could have easily done them before Alda came.
We had talked about doing something, just hanging out in the apartment, buying
some alcohol and perhaps ordering some food.

In the morning I cooked all of my eggs, half of a dozen of them.
I separated the scrambled eggs from the pan into two halves.
One went into my bowl and the rest in a tupperware.
Not even 15 minutes passed after I finished the bowl, when I went back and ate
the rest. I felt not only full, but disgusted with myself. Would that count
as binge eating? I felt so hungry and I couldn't stop. I didn't want to eat
anything else for the rest of the day.

Alda came and told me she didn't want to drink anything.
For once, I was actually OK with the idea of not drinking. I didn't want to eat
anything either, so we just smoked outside the balcony.

I kept looking into Armando's room and saw how his lights were on.
That was the last I thought about him until he came out close to two in the morning.

I'm actually glad that I decided not to tell anything to Alda.
When we were thinking about what to watch, she mentioned the second comedy
special of Dave Chappelle. I was hesitant to the idea, not only because of the
obvious awkwardness of hearing trans jokes with her by my side, but also because
it's not even funny.

There it was the perfect opportunity to ask her:
_Did you meet many transgender people when you were in New York?_, but I didn't.

We ordered food and ate.
Poutine, it was good.

What wasn't good was the feeling I had when I went to my room and saw all of
the notifications that were on my phone. Most of them from Armando, asking us
to be more quiet. None of us saw his messages. He kept at it instead of
coming out and saying something. I mean, he shouldn't have to in the first
place, sure. But, I'm certain that he ended up this mad because of the
idea that we were purposefully ignoring him.

When I saw his messages, I thought about actually ignoring him, but instead I
wrote a short one telling him sorry and that I had not seen them.

Four hours later, when I woke up drenched in sweat, I wrote him a longer one.
It's almost 24 hours later and he never replied. I am not totally sure what
exactly I am feeling about it. Am I upset? Guilty? Annoyed?

I got caught in a thought loop.
Over and over I could see how I ran circles through the same thoughts.
I don't remember the last time I was that high.
Maybe with the brownie in Las Vegas.
Maybe...

I sent a message to Louis telling him that I'd be missing the Neuro meeting
because I had an appointment with a therapist. I knew that whenever you mention
mental health, people get sensitive about it and respect your privacy.
He was very understanding.
_Health is always more important than lab meetings._

I wished Kate good luck on her test and she replied quickly.
Close to noon, I contacted her again asking if we had settled on any plans for
later. She had just finished her test. She told me she would shower,
eat something and head out. By the end, I could had gone to the lab meeting
and headed out myself after at the same time I did.

I waited for her outside the metro station sitting under the sun.
I was not wearing my coat, just the gray hoodie over a t-shirt.
She recognized me before I did.
We hugged and I gave her the options I had thought.

_I had three options_, I had prepared telling her, _depending on what you want
to drink; if you want coffee, we can go to this authentic italian cafe.
If you want to drink tea, there's a cute tea house a couple blocks ahead._

In my head then she would ask me about the third option,
to which I could continue.
_Do I really need to tell you the third option?
That's if you don't want to drink anything._

Right then and there, I just gave her the first two options.

Later she would tell me how at the party of her friend, she was one of only
a handful of people wearing masks.

"I actually thought about cancelling you.
Well, maybe not cancel, but tell you that I was feeling a bit sick in my
stomach and a headache.

"Like, I wanted to kiss you after today.
I want to kiss you, but, I don't want to make you sick and ruin your holiday.
We can kiss next time when you return."

In me head, I doubted there would be a next time.
Even if she promised me, and even if she later fulfilled that promise,
I would not see her for another month.
Instead of telling her how I was desperate to kiss her,
I just lied saying that I'd consider it.

We kept chatting and I saw some things that made me think about the night when
I saw her story of her party and noticed how I started losing interest.
She had promised to give me all of the attention that she doesn't give me on
the phone, and yet several times she was on her phone answering some messages.

The might have been important, even I have done it sometimes with other people,
yet it felt off.
Did she really want to be there?

I told her the story behind my roommates teasing me with her trip to Ontario.
She promised she wouldn't do it to me on my return,
then she promised me we'd go to the cat cafe.

We left after 16h.
I did feel a little anxious about the time, but, like Armando,
I kept those feelings to myself instead of saying anything.
I walked with her to the metro station.
She said something about putting her mask back on,
and even though I told the story to several different people,
I don't really remember what exactly I said.

I just remember her asking me surprised with a little bit of shyness
that caught me off guard if I then really wanted to kiss her.

She got closer to me and put her hand gently on my arm.
I don't remember if I grabbed her lower back or put mine on her hip.
I am sure, though, that I laid my fingers on her cheek after our lips met.

This time I didn't think about closing my eyes.
It was longer than I was expecting and still not enough.

She said something about kissing me again,
and I welcomed her without my breath.
I hold her closer; this time I didn't want to let go.

After half a minute or a lifetime,
She pulled back and I noticed her face had changed.
There was colour on her cheeks and in her voice.
She told me she'd text me,
and then she asked me to tell her whenever I'd get to the airport,
she didn't want to think that she had made me miss my flight.

I jogged home and ran some of the way.
I picked up my luggage and asked for an uber.
While he arrived, I started telling people about what had just happened.

I got to the airport and went through security in a breeze.
The metal detector wasn't like the one in the US.
I had asked Armando yesterday with the intention of telling him why it makes
me anxious.
He dismissed me to go to his weekly call with his girlfriend,
so when he later asked me by message I dismissed him, too.

I passed security with still close to an hour before boarding.
The flight was oversold and so they looked for volunteers to be moved to a
later flight and be compensated with food and some money.

I thought about the 50 dollars of Uber that I had just spent because of my date.
I didn't want to go back home.
But then again, it would be easier for me than for other people.
Sonny wouldn't even be at her house by the time that I would be arriving.
And so, I went and volunteered.

Later they mentioned that the money was a thousand dollars.

I got stuck with two older québécois men.
They annoyed me at first.
When we got to migration,
I got stuck with them and they had to wait for their baggage.
I was misgendered once and felt insecure.
It's the second time that I am called sir here.
This time it was in French.
I noticed how later I would unconsciously speak with a higher voice.

I had to wait a couple of hours for all the administration hell of it,
but ended with a voucher for 10 dollars in any restaurant in the airport,
and one for 900 dollars.

I didn't even have to go back home.
I will arrive at the same time as Sonny.
I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight either.

I got on the 23h flight.
The second time back in, I did have to go through the 3D scanners,
nothing flashed, or at least the security officer didn't need to pat me down.
Could it be that she flashed me male?
One of the staff had just called me _monsieur_ earlier.
Later, in Mexico, when I went outside to be picked up by Sonny,
one taxi driver called me _joven_.

While I was waiting for her on the steps inside the airport drinking my coffee,
I told Sonny how the migration officer had been weirdly different with me
than with the previous people.
I remember seeing a family at her counter and she was all laughs and smiles.
She seemed even nice.
I felt relieved when she freed up and called me next.

Instead at first she was cold and then slowly made me feel uncomfortable with
her hostility.
She asked me for my name after seeing my face and the passport.
Did I have a shadow?
Most probably, I had shaved very early given Armando's drama.

It's been more than 24 hours and he never replied to my apology.
I thought about sending him a half-joking message with something of the like
of _oh, well, I'll just go fuck myself, I guess_.

There's no point, so I just let it go.

We got to Sonny's and went straight to bed after changing clothes.
She asked if she could hug me and I agreed.
She put her arm on my stomach and slowly moved her hand up to my breast.
I stopped her the first couple of times.

By then I still had the phantom sensation of Kate's hand on my arm.
I remembered her specifically stating she wasn't looking for anything
exclusive and her most recent explanation that she's not really in a mental
space to be having a serious relationship.

Could she had been scared off by my most recent messages?

And with that in mind, I agreed to Sonny's advances.
She asked me to turn around and tried to kiss me.
I moved my face away and told her no.

The emotions that are still present a year later were impossible to ignore.
While she touched me under my pants,
I kept thinking how different would it feel if instead of Sonny's it were
Kate's hand in there.
I thought about the warm sensation of the side of her palm on my breast when
she kissed me a second time.

At that point I stopped Sonny.

Things didn't go well afterwards.
She kept insisting that we could have casual sex.
I argued that it's impossible for me to have casual sex with her given how I
have—and will keep having—feelings towards her.

She threw to my face how me letting her start was,
as matter of fact, been me using her.

She wasn't wrong, but it only made me realize that letting it go even further
wouldn't make it any better for anyone.
She cried telling me how she had her heart broken.
Someone cheated on her last March.

In the morning, I received a message from Kate replying to my last ones.
She asked me what had happened at the end and then shared with me how she saw
_Love, Actually_, her favorite Christmas movie.

I sent a message to Paty confessing her that around the time of the picture I
had sent her of us, I had a crush on her.
Apparently, she had one on me as well.
She sent me an audio explaining succinctly how she just liked me a lot back
then, but, because she was interested in Paola, she didn't pursue anything.

"Talking about rewatching something.
I can't sleep in planes,
so the whole flight I kept reliving the memory of us outside the metro station
exactly like how when I was a child I would smell those perfume sample strips
until all of the fragrance faded.
I feel a little silly, but even up to when we were close to landing I would
somehow lose my breath a little just thinking about it."
