"...you're soo cute. I really enjoyed our kiss, too! No regrets."

I'm back home.

Or is it that I have returned from home?

Honestly, I don't know what I didn't continue with the words while I was away.
There is lots of stuff that happened and that I could had written about.
There was the trip with Sonny and her friends,
and the COVID scare after the only kiss I had last year.
There's the continuous flirting that's been going on with Kate,
and the inner feelings that I repressed when looking at Les.

I've gained weight.
I finally weighted myself after a whole year here when they admitted me in the
clinic in Puerto Vallarta.
I was 70 kilograms.
It's probably the thinnest I've been in more than a decade.
While I don't think I've gotten over 75,
I shouldn't be much lighter than that.

I saw Monica and we had tea together.
We planned going to Santa Monica but we had to cancel our trip given she
tested positive.

She wasn't the first one that tested positive.
Kate sent me the message about her roommate's fever and her feeling sick
before I left for Puerto Vallarta.
I didn't cancel the trip hoping that it wasn't Covid,
so I got extra nervous when I felt sick and had a fever of my own on my
second night there.

Paty and the girls decided to take me to a hospital.
My blood pressure was low,
but not as low that the Dr would decide to hospitalize me.
I was sent home with antibiotics and a serum to get rehydrated.

On my last night in Puerto Vallarta, after we returned the rental,
Kate sent me a message stating that her results had come back and she was in
fact sick with COVID.

In Guadalajara Sonny took a rapid antigen test that came back negative.
I travelled to Tijuana where I took a PCR test that would eventually come back
negative as well on Christmas Eve.

While writing these words, I put on a random movie on Amazon Prime.
I got interested in it because I recognized Alison Brie.
When I saw that it also had Jason Sudeikis I put it on.
The first scene was of them hooking up in college, after chatting about sex,
sitting on a couch on the roof.
I started getting a faint smell.
When I looked into my shorts, I noticed a huge mark in my underpants.
What the fuck is wrong with me?

I don't remember what was the message I sent to Kate that night.
No, it wasn't any message.
I reacted with an emoji on her story with the cat.
A couple minutes after midnight she sent me a Merry Christmas message.

Between that night and New Year's, she kept reacting to my stories.
First she asked about Nym.

"The ultimate cutie pie." She said.

"Wait, then what am I?" I responded teasing.

"You make a good point, the competition is fierce."

I cut my hair.
Unlike the previous haircuts that I've gotten, this one was a radical change.
Before I transitioned, even before I had any idea of who I really am,
I would fantasize about having long enough hair to tie it behind my back.
This is the first time since after Spain, after I named myself,
that I can't tie it in a ponytail.

I posted a story of the ponytail cut on Instagram fishing for reactions or
comments, purposefully not putting a picture of the result.
A bunch of people reached out, including Kate.

"I'm sure it'll be the same tough tie", said Kate uninvited.

I met Monica waiting for her reaction.
She'd be the only person who would tell me honestly that I had made a huge
mistake with the bangs.
Either I was wrong or she loved it.

"You should always get your hair cut in bangs like that, it suits you",
complimented Monica.

I went to the pharmacy today to pick up my prescription for antidepressants.
I bought paper towels, soap—for hands and body—, and condoms.
I bought a box of condoms.
Do I really think I will use them?
In both having sex with someone or feel the need to use them?

I keep getting distracted by the movie.
I feel like I'm losing my breath a little.
Is my higher libido a side effects of the antidepressants,
or just a sign that they're working?

The latest messages I exchanged with Kate were after I sent her a message
telling her that the park she was at looked really nice.
I commented that I might go soon, and she confirmed it, _option number 6 now_.

We talked about having more options and how we could discard some of them
given the pandemic.

"Just being with you and getting to kiss you again", I told her,
"I'd be down even for something like getting groceries."

"Hahah, with the way the pandemic is, we might [do] just that as a date!"

"I mean, even if everything closes again, we'll always have number 5.
You're always welcome to just come over,
with the curfew you might've to stay the night, tho."

"Oups, I might do that then."

The last message I sent her was that I'd love that.
No, it was later that night, on Whatsapp,
I replied with a sad emoticon to her answer that she didn't have her
photoshoot.
She had taken a picture of her eye makeup after I asked her about it on
new year's eve.
She told me that she was planning on having a photoshoot with her friend.

_I wonder if you think about me at random times of the day... or night.
Maybe I'm just the weird one_

I had thought about waiting until my quarantine would end after getting the
negative results of the airport test and then send her a hook-up text,
something along the lines of
_I can't stop thinking about you. Do you want to come over?_

No, I hate that last part.
If I do end up sending it, it would have to be something better.
Maybe a second text, more personal.

_Option 8?_

### Friday, January 14th, 2022
_I think about the last time that I saw you.
Not the kiss necessarily, but the small details that surround it like bookends.
I think about the warmth of your hand on my arm when you got close and the
color of your cheeks when you pulled away._

_I thought about inviting you to come over, you know, our last option.
I wanted you here with me, do more than just kiss you...
drawing on your skin with my fingertips,
hearing whispers of your voice in my ear._

I couldn't fall asleep during the night.
The sun might have come up, but I didn't really notice it.
The last marking of the clock that I remember was beyond 5 in the morning.
I sent a message to Sonny telling her that I was considering getting up.

I did not.
I slept until around 10.
It was those kind of mornings before I left last year when I would grab the
phone to see if I received a particular message.
I didn't this time.

Monica sent me an image of an editorial piece saying how there is backlash
against the idea that trans teens should receive psychological counseling
before being approved for HRT;
how is unfair and a denial of basic health benefits with a caption asking for
my opinion.

"It's true", was the only thing I said.

Later, after brewing my coffee I explained myself.
I talked about gatekeeping and the meritocracy and policing of sexual variant
bodies.
I wonder what would Kate think; this is her area of expertise.
Sexual and woman studies.
_Have you been with someone transfemme before?_

"BTW, I was wondering do you happen to know how to get Molly?" I asked Alda.
"The drug obvs, not the girl."

Alda told me to ask Danny or Vix.
One of them might know.
I don't have Danny's contact but I have Vix's, or at least I used to.
I follow him on Instagram so it would be just a message.
Alda told me to get a couple for her if I did.
I sent nothing. Maybe tomorrow?

I got a reply from Calli.
She gave me a couple of options for our next appointment.
It will be through Teams.
I chose Monday, before the Neuro meeting.
Later, Louis would propose to talk about something exactly half an hour before it,
but I don't think he'd mind if I skip that.

I started yesterday to fill the new bullet journal.
It looks cleaner, for now.

I looked into the candidacy exam after chatting with Louis yesterday.
The information on the website is misleading.
It says that I have to get it approved before August 31st,
but also that I have to present the oral exam by the end of the semester.
There is another deadline by the end of April,
which happens to be after the end of the Winter term.
I feel confused and stressed.
Louis mentioned yesterday that I've been working on Qrater and I can present that.
Does it count?
Why wouldn't it?

I'm feeling something crawling in my skin.
Not literally like the sensations that made my grandma start taking antipsychotics,
but in the more metaphorical sense.
It's as if stress were a bunch of ants that are enfolding me from the feet up.
I feel them walking behind my neck and pushing themselves inside my ears.
There's the urge of scratching my skin off.
I feel dirty, corrupted.
I'll probably get in the shower after finishing these words.

Last night I touched myself.
I tried a couple of times fruitlessly and the third time I finally came.
Three or maybe four white spots are still in my blue sheets.
Would anyone notice what they are?
Do I?

Am I capable of getting someone pregnant?
How would that make me feel?

When I was returning from the pharmacy,
as I was walking uphill with the condoms in my backpack,
voices in my head were rehearsing how the conversation would go if it came
to the need to actually use them.
_I'd rather go through the very mild dysphoria of putting one on,
than even risk the gargantuan one of somehow fathering a baby_.

I told Kate about the book I read, Detransition, Baby.
It was about motherhood.
She might be very interested in what I would have to say about this kind of
emotions.
It's a horrible topic for conversation for the girl I'm dating and want to
have sex with, though.
It's probably not something I should bring up.

Maybe this thing that we have going on is not working for me.
I'm not in a good mental place for it.
After sending the message last night, I kept going over it in my head.
Doubting it, feeling insecure about it; wanting to take it back and swallow it.
Even just now, I keep thinking how she might be creeped out by it.
Why?
It's the true, I do wonder if she thinks about me, and I do think about her.

I just wrote about telling her about the mixed emotions I feel about
hypothetically getting someone pregnant.
When I was wondering about telling Alda about me,
she was the first person that I wanted to share it with.
I thought about mentioning the relief I got after passing security in the airport.
I do think about her.

Yet, I feel like I should hide it.
Because, if she knows the effect she has on me,
she might realize that it's better to leave.

What's the worst that could happen, though, that she stops replying?
Doesn't she do that already?

It would just be a longer wait.

### Saturday, January 15th, 2022
_I just got the results from the test of the airport.
I officially don't have COVID.
Again.
I don't think there's a curfew anymore,
but you still can come over and stay the night if you want.
I'd love having you all to myself for a full night._

Am I being obsessive?

I forgot to mark the time when I ate.
I'm using the app again to record my fasting.
I stopped at Puerto Vallarta.
The Dr specifically told me not to have long periods of fasting when I was at
the clinic.

Tomorrow is Johanna's birthday.
I was sitting on the couch,
reading my book on the kindle when I thought about exchanging letters with
someone, anyone.
Emails are a big part of Rooney's books.
I envy those interactions.
They could be like these sort of entries.
Long exchanges of intimate thoughts and emotions.
It'd be normal to wait several days, maybe even weeks, between responses.

I thought about Johanna and the message I sent to her last year.
She replied back to me proposing a videochat,
but we never pursued the conversation further.

She congratulated me last week on my birthday.
I knew hers would be any time soon this month and so I checked her profile to
see if there was an email in there.
There wasn't.
There were birthday messages from last year.
Will I send her something tomorrow?
I know I should, and probably will, but do I want to?

I dreamed about Monica.
She was sick.
Cancer?
Something about her breasts.
Later during the day,
when I told her I had dreamed of her and that we were a couple
I skipped that part.
I remembered how she actually had surgery on her breast before we started
dating in high school.

I told her this time I was the man and that nothing fun or dirty happened.
I said we were just chatting and she sat on my lap.
Was it just that what happened?
Why did I think we were a couple then?
Maybe we kissed.
No, I would remember that.

I checked my emails and I had one from the government of Quebec.
It reminded me about the protocol for travellers.
It was way more explicit and detailed than the paper flyer they gave me at the
airport.
Apparently I had to report my arrival to my place of quarantine before 48
hours after my entry to the country.
I still haven't gotten the test results nor a response from Kate.

I asked Monica if she had given COVID to her guy.
She told me that he did get sick but not from her.
He also tested negative recently.
They haven't seen each other for obvious reasons, but they talk everyday.

They are seriously dating.
They have the same age.
Well, I think.

When I told Alda that the idea of being more interested in someone than they
are into me made me nervous,
she told me it was completely normal and it always happens.
Is that what happens with me?
I lose interest when I notice the other person is more interested in me?

It happened with Monica well into our relationship.
It happened with Catherine from the beginning when I realized she had feelings
for me.
It happened with Sonny when she started getting pushy with sex;
I lost my libido entirely.

With Kate, it is fairly obvious that I am way more interested than her.
It wasn't mixed signals, I considered last month, but her ADHD.
But is it, though?

"Do you make all your dates wait months between seeing you again?
Because it's really effective, let me tell you"

"It's not a move, I promise.
But, **yes**. Like, I get stressed and busy, it's really accidental."

She was the one that brought up seeing each other again,
just like that other time.

Also, there's no 8th option.
After bringing out the idea of going grocery shopping during the pandemic,
I called back to my previous proposal of coming back to my place.
It was the original 5th.

She reposted a story from a friend of hers.
The thing that happened when I saw that other picture of hers at the party
didn't happen this time.
I replayed the picture a couple of times.
Her friend seemed Mexican—or at least Latina.
Does she see my stories in a similar way?

I posted something about picking up a package in shorts.
I received several comments and reactions, even something from Paty.

Nothing from her.
I'll wait until after getting the negative results from the airport.
I'll be direct this time.
She already said before that she'd come.
What am I really expecting from this?

I feel like I'm missing something.
Something doesn't feel right.

### Sunday, January 16th, 2022
"Everyone's like: _Sofía, WTF is wrong with you?_
But, nobody's like: _Sofi, here's my email,
send me a long and intimate email about WTF is wrong with you_"

I might be starting to show symptoms of depression again.
I couldn't get out of bed in the morning.
I woke up rested at around 8h,
but I stayed in there with no motivation to start the day.
I wasn't hungry, I didn't want to watch anything online nor did I crave the
taste of freshly brewed coffee.
I turned and covered myself with the duvet and the pillow that was behind my back.
I finally got up after noon.

Last night, shortly after I finished my words,
I got the email from dynacare with the results from my PCR test.
They were negative, of course.
I can go out now and don't have to continue reporting my symptoms to that
phone number.
What's the difference anyway?
Everything's closed still.
I have no one to go out with.

The first thing that I thought when I got those results was that I could send
that message to Kate.
Maybe that would produce a response from her.
Maybe.

It didn't.
But to be fair, she hasn't seen it.
She hasn't opened the conversation.
That was the second time I contacted her.
It was last night.

Does that have anything to do with my low mood?
I feel pathetic just considering it.
Calli would tell me that I am allowed to feel this way.
I am not the only one who feels bad when they think they're being ignored or
that they're not getting the attention they want.

Do I hate these feelings because they're feminine?
Or do I relate them more with childishness and immaturity?

I posted the picture I took last night of the Kindle with a text blurb
sharing my want of exchanging emails.

I got some responses, but the first one was Armando's.
He was an asshole as usual; a playful asshole.
I know he's not being a dick on purpose, or at least not with malice.
I relate his attitude to the way that Anahí and Catherine would playfully
diss me.
I hated it, but I knew they didn't really mean it.
Is it a particular Mexican thing?

I posted that again as a second story and that got more responses.
Monica told me she felt offended given that I didn't send her any email.
Clau—or is it Alex, now? Maybe I should check that with them—took my offer.
Aliza asked me if Telegram was OK, or would I prefer an e-mail.

A couple of weeks ago I shared with Monica the irony of how I didn't catch
the hint with Meghan—the girl from the club—, but I was wondering if someone
liked me because she liked two of my Instagram posts in a row.

I feel a little like that when I wonder what's the issue with Aliza.
How would I behave if the places were swapped and she had just asked me if
something had happened while she stayed in my place.
My reaction to this hypothetical scenario would vary entirely depending on if
I were attracted to her or not.

Could I write about that in an e-mail?
Maybe, but surely not the first one.

Kate saw my stories,
but didn't send anything like those three days between Christmas and New year's.
She posted two of herself.
Two videos of children sledding in the snow.
There was music in them.
It was in Spanish; Carla Morrison.
These ones, unlike the last picture of her, I only watched twice.

I wish I had some alcohol right now.
I'll go out tomorrow after the Neuro meeting.
I have to read those papers.
It's still very early.
The sun setting at this hour really messes with my sense of time.

I keep thinking about Kate and my reaching out.
She doesn't know that I watch her stories several times.
For all I know, she could do the same thing with mine—although, I'd bet she
doesn't.
Again, the distaste I feel after I reached out to her a third time in those
stories without letting her get back to me,
is it because of the lack of replies?
Or is it the hypothetical impression she might get about me being _too pushy_,
as Monica said?

I know she's nice, she wouldn't outright tell me that I'm too attached.
Perhaps that makes it worse.

She was direct, though.
After what Eliseo told me and I talked with Monica about my feelings related
to her mixed signals, she was quite direct and assertive,
telling me that she tries to get back to me as soon as she can,
when she stops feeling overwhelmed by her day or stuff.

It made me feel silly.

"Maybe I was the toxic one, all along", I told Eliseo afterwards.
He didn't deny it nor confirmed it.

These traits aren't necessarily feminine.
They are signs of emotionally immaturity.

And just now,
after typing this, I think back to the conversation I had with Anahí and get
overly conscious that I am five years older than her.
I am the one acting—and feeling—like a teenager.

### Monday, 2022-01-17
"La intimidad quizá es un poco más dulce cuando la compartimos con alguien
que no la merece."

Last night I sent the e-mail to Monica.
I really liked it.
I re-read it again when I was lying on the bed before falling asleep.
I loved the way I closed it.
It felt like a letter that would be inside a book,
without feeling fake or performative.
I did feel like I mentioned Kate too much—like sometimes I feel in these
entries—but when I read it again,
I thought it wasn't that focused on that subject.

She sent me a text this afternoon telling me that she had read it and was
going to write me a response, but maybe not today.
I opened Whatsapp in my recent  urge to open the app and see if I've had any
new messages.
I saw she was typing and I rushed to sent her a message first before she could
send hers.

"Typing, typing... what are you typing?"

I reassured her not to feel pressured about it and that she could reply back
whenever.
It is actually very nice not feeling the anxiety and insecurity about not
getting a response.

I didn't want to wake up and I kept postponing the alarm.
Last night I did read the papers for this morning meeting,
but maybe it wouldn't have been any difference if I hadn't.

I showered and changed just in time to log in into the deep nuclei meeting
that Louis had scheduled.
I thought about sending him an email or a message to tell him that I had an
appointment and would have to leave early.
Neither Neda nor Vicky were at the beginning of the meeting.
Louis talked about rescheduling and I thought about my last day here in
Montreal last year when I cancelled the Neuro meeting with them because I'd be
meeting with Kate and ended up meeting her an hour after the meeting ended.

Half an hour later, not much after Neda logged in and they actually started
talking about what they were going to talk about,
I got a message from Calli asking me if I was ready for our session.
In there I shared with her how I feel embarrassed about talking about dating.
She must have picked up something because she shared with me how she didn't
start dating until her thirties, so of course I wasn't late.

I remember my own training back in college and how she even apologized for
talking about her in session.
That's how you're supposed to do it.
Apologize or avoid it entirely; don't give your opinions nor thoughts.
I know it goes against the specialized training that an LGBT counselor must
have gone through,
but sometimes I really wish she'd just tell me how it's all in my head,
how there's nothing weird in that Alda nor Armando had any suspicions that I
am trans.

I want to hear that I do pass,
that my voice doesn't sound any bit masculine and that my beard shadow,
whenever it's visible,
only looks like the kind of problem a woman would have because of a
hormonal imbalance.

That's what I've heard from both Monica and Sonny, why is it not enough?
If Calli were to say something like that,
I'm sure I'd doubt her with some ridiculous reason like that she's only
saying it because she's my therapist and doesn't really believe it.

After writing Monica's email last night, I started working on Lomelin's one.
It did help to take my mind of Kate's silence.
Last night she replied to my Instagram's message telling me how she had just
gotten her period.
I wrote in the email I sent Monica how I still feel weird about that subject.
With Calli, I mentioned the other dream I had when I had it in my twenties.

_It's not too late._
That was the phrase that triggered me into thinking about that,
about all the stuff I missed.
I feel embarrassed just typing this,
but I really wish I could have gone through a normal childhood.

One YouTuber posted an image on twitter about the two hands holding the
colored pills from the matrix.
One would make you wake up as a six year old with all of your present memories,
the other one would give you I-don't-know-how-many million dollars.
The tweet was maybe two hours long when I replied that I, as a trans woman,
would take the red pill no matter the amount of money that the other one would
give.

I deleted the reply maybe an hour later.
Nobody liked it or replied to it.
It's the first time that I've posted in social media about me being trans.
Several people from the lab could had seen it, maybe some did.
I don't know why I did it.

I just know that I wouldn't prefer any amount of money in the world against
the chance of having grown up as a normal girl.

### Tuesday, January 18th, 2022
"You let me know when you're feeling well and are not so busy.
It's your turn to ask me out this time."

This morning I woke up and drafted the e-mail to Aliza.
In it I let myself dare to confess to her about me being trans.
I got into more detail about the night in DC and the dream I had.
I told her about the song I've been listening lately,
the same song that's currently ending in Spotify.

In the afternoon I actually considered just copying and pasting here the
entire e-mail.
It took a couple of hours to finish.
I feel nervous about the response she might give me to my paragraph about my
wondering if there were any rumours in the halls of the institute about my
identity.
In the second e-mail of the day, the one I sent to Melissa, I told her I was
nervous about receiving a response like
_I already knew, but thanks for sharing it finally_.

In the afternoon, Kate's conversation came back from the archive in Whatsapp.
There were two brief and straight-to-the-point messages in my notification screen.

"Sure, sometimes I do, yes." She answered nonchalantly my question about
thinking of me.
She explained how she doesn't really remember the contents of it,
but they're in the kind of way of remembering that we somewhen had a similar
conversation before.

The second one was a reply to my negative results.
She asked me in a weirdly formatted message if that meant that I would be
coming back soon.

"Kate, I've been here since last week."

Half an hour before midnight she replied again, telling me that she didn't know.
She asked if I was happy to be back, just in time for snowstorms.
I ignored her question and just made a comment about missing the snow back
south and then finally getting it yesterday.

"If I start to miss you, too, will I get to see you again soon?"

I thought that message was quite charming.
Later today, as I shared in Monica's e-mail, I started having doubts.
She replied back a while ago, with a laugh, we should meet soon yes.
She later, like how she used to, explained that she was feeling sick and
would have to cancel her plans and rest.

In the afternoon I saw a YouTube video titled
_Should we play it cool when we like someone?_
I went into it expecting an excuse to my overeaginess.
Instead, I was confronted with the term _manic dependence._

"...their underlying priority is to ensure that they are never alone without
someone, rather than with any one being in particular."

And, holy shit, did I realize that I might have a problem.

I saw her latest messages and, after finishing my sandwich,
overthought my reply.
I wished her well and, in another message,
told her to let me know when she were well and not-so-busy.
I ended it telling her that it was her turn to ask me out.
This time, it didn't take too long for me to start doubting it, again.

I'll possibly won't see her again.
She doesn't really start the conversations and doesn't have the initiative
to look me up.
It makes me think, though,
do I really want to be with her if that's really the case?
On one hand, I really hate having to always have the initiative and feel
insecure about the long silences and whether I did or said something wrong;
on the other, I also get disinterested when girls do show me too much attention.

She hasn't seen it and probably won't until tomorrow.
I'm sure she'll probably write something like _yes, with pleasure_,
a laugh and an emoticon with flushed cheeks or hearts or something of the like.
And then days will pass and I won't be asked out.
Either I'll cave and ask her out myself,
or I'll see stories on her Instagram and feel both insecure and angry,
first with her, and then with myself.

If this were a book and I were the main character, I'd be so unlikeable.

In our session, Calli reminded me again that I should be more forgiving with
myself.
Let myself experience the emotions I feel instead of pushing them away and
console myself with the thought that it is human to feel them and how they,
like everything, will pass.

It is human to feel this insecure about being so needy.
It is normal to not want to feel vulnerable.
It's OK to be this attracted to someone and worrying that the feeling is not
reciprocated.

And this, like everything, will pass.

### Wednesday, January 19th, 2022
"No sé que es eso específico de ti que mi inconsciente se bloquea.
Como te decía anoche, tengo tantas cosas que podría contarte o decirte—muchas
de esas ya te las he dicho—pero cuando abro esta ventana para escribirlas
quedo en blanco.
¿Crees que sea la misma razón por la que no sueño contigo?

"Cuando chica fantaseaba que mis sueños vívidos y extremadamente reales eran
visitas a otras realidades,
mundos alternos donde mi vida era diferente de alguna manera.
Sonny, si fuera cierto, he visitado tantos tiempos y espacios donde viven
distintas Sofías y, por alguna razón peculiar, solamente yo te tengo.
¿Por qué solo existe una versión de ti?
¿Qué tengo de especial yo que no tenga el resto que me hace merecedora de
tenerte para mí sola?

"Podría decirte que quisiera llevarte conmigo en mis sueños y presumirte como
quería enseñarte de la mano a mis amigos y familia cuando te invité a Tijuana,
pero sonrío con la idea de pensar que soy la única Sofía de mi multiverso que
tiene el placer de conocerte.
Qué afortunada."

I finished the e-mail.

I've been thinking about letting things die off with Kate.
At least try.
Again,
I want to be the first one to stop caring, to leave before being abandoned.
Did she ever care? Where is this all coming from?

She asked me if I would be returning soon.
Instead of taking it as a sign that she wants to see me,
I compared it to how I would obsess about her stories.
I know she saw the one where posted the plane's wing and the snow.
Or the one about the temperature and picking up the package.
I had thought that she might do what I do about letting all of them appear
without giving them any attention.
And I'm listening here to this song in repeat.

OK and a smiley face. Will I hear from her again?

Good, I'll take the opportunity to practice my self-control.

Will I be able to stay away? She did send some messages,
almost every day between Christmas and New Year's.
What happened those days?

Tinder is back online.
I was thinking about it and how I should be able to stop focusing on this when
I considered trying again with that app.
There wasn't really any hope that something different would happen.
This time it let me create a new account and everything was the same.
I swiped a couple of profiles and just put it away. Hours later,
when I came back, I had 9 people that had liked my pictures.
When I stopped playing, there were 3—or was it 4?—matches.

None of them I liked really, and wasn't that the problem in the first place?

This time I put the transgender flag in the bio.
Because it's a new account, it's normal that I'm getting more attention.
It's all part of the algorithm.
In the back of my mind I noticed the presence of a mild anxiety that Kate's
profile would appear.

Several times I've gone looking into our match and seeing her pictures to see
if she has changed anything.
I don't know what I expect from that.
She told me upfront she didn't want anything exclusive and later told me
again that she's not in a mental place for a serious relationship.
Why did I let myself get this attached?
How did it happen?
After the date I was disappointed,
when Alda asked me enthusiastically how it had gone I didn't know what to answer.

Let's see how many days passes before either she does ask me out,
or I succumb to my own impulses and ruin everything.
Is waiting infinitely to the never-coming message even a possibility at this
point?

Alex has replied to my mail.
I haven't read it.
Why?

I expected this from Aliza's,
that one actually makes me nervous for reasons I don't think I have to explain,
but this?
Is this what Kate feels with my Whatsapp messages, maybe?
No, again I'm giving myself too much credit.

I'm not as present in her mind as she's in mine.
And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

Well, maybe there is. She shouldn't be.

Stop.

Tomorrow I'll get vaccinated.
I have to pick up my hormones,
maybe I can make a stop at the currency exchange house and the bank.
It would be good to also get some coffee beans.
I hope I don't feel too sick, even though I actually do hope I do.

### Thursday, January 20th, 2022
"And did you talk with _Frenchy_ again? Oh, she's missing out then."

After telling myself to stop being that much fixated on this specific girl,
I kept thinking about the last time I saw her and what could happen the next
time.
It's probably the hormones—or perhaps the antidepressants?—,
but I literally was breathless because of my own thoughts.
The mere thought of having her by my side on a couch and putting my hand on her
leg, my mind wandering to her hand on my arm,
flashes of fantasized skin over the fresh sheets, whispers and soft laughter.

I don't think I'll be able to keep myself from reaching out again,
which is by itself enough reason of why I must.

I am not really dating anyone else;
but I don't mind if you are, you said since the beginning that you were not
looking for something exclusive.
Am I not jealous?
How is it that I can't go a single day without thinking of her,
that it's fairly probable that she's seeing other people,
and I am not consumed by those feelings of insecurity?

Is it her loss, though?

I read Alex's email.
I am still not sure what scared me about it.
They're like me, but different.
Even though our paths go through very distinct places,
it was comforting reading someone's perspective of the world and experiences
so similar to mine.
I should probably write back to them soon,
but I'm not sure what I want to tell them.
Perhaps I could wait for Aliza's response, if I ever get one.

Monica, Sonny, Aliza, Melissa, Kate.
I am waiting for these women's words.
All of them said—except Sonny, she never really said that she'd write back
again now that I think of it—they would get back to me.
Why is it that deep down I don't believe them?

Am I this excited about what they could say?
Melissa replied back almost instantly telling me she'd write to me when she'd
feel better.
Monica did something similar, asking me permission to reply through e-mail,
but at a later moment.
Aliza didn't, after what I say, even though her answer is the one that makes
me most nervous, that could be reason enough about why avoid writing it.
And Kate...

What more could I write about Kate? Two dates and I'm still writing mostly
about her.

She liked my picture in Instagram.
The first thought that comes to my head is that she must like everything she
sees.
Why am I this way?

I took the picture when I was returning from my morning pending tasks.
I had the third dose of the vaccine.
It was messy, a lot of issues with the process and waiting, but I got it.
I didn't really feel that bad, but still took the opportunity to cancel today's
meeting with Louis and not do any work.
I probably shouldn't have done that.
I have some important questions to Louis about the comps and my project.
The date keeps getting closer and closer, bigger, threatening.

I bought a bottle of vodka,
changed the 600 USD and deposited them in my bank account.
I went to the pharmacy to get my hormones and bought a bag of coffee beans,
one of chips and a bottle of watermelon juice.

I took the picture in my room.
Monica told me it was _cute_  and to post it.
I dismissed the idea like I always do and, as if she had read my mind,
she added that I never do it—or just post them as stories.

This morning I posted Sonny's fragment of the e-mail as a story but deleted it
later in the afternoon.
I put on the picture of me with the band-aid of the vaccine.
Lately I've been posting the stories as a way to see if Kate sees them and as
a way of giving her the opportunity of replying to them as she did back in
that week of December.

I posted the picture in Facebook and in Instagram.
I tagged Monica in both.
Sonny asked me if I had a crush on her.
Do I?
I told her I don't—I've told myself that several times as well back in the past.
But, do I, though?

Yesterday I cooked the stew.
I had some more this evening.
Tomorrow I'll cook the meatballs with mash.
There's still some leftovers from yesterday in the freezer.
Perhaps I should cancel the next HelloFresh box that isn't free.

### Friday, January 21st, 2022
_Now, like a lot love stories back in 2022, this one starts with a Tinder date._

"Uh, Sophie?"

"Yeah"

I didn't last two whole days.

I'm sitting on the couch in my living room waiting for Alda to share to come
and finalize a trade: she can have some of the meatballs and horseradish
mashed potatoes after I smoke some weed with her.

I snorted after finishing the previous paragraph.

In the morning I sent Kate a text wondering if sending her flirtatious
messages would count as cheating.
Because that wasn't dumb enough, I added that I could hold them too,
if she preferred.

God dammit.
I'm really bad at this.
Soon after sending them,
I first started worrying that she might misunderstand the 'cheating' part.
Moments later I just regretted them entirely.

She hasn't opened them by the time I'm typing this sentence.
It's Friday, she probably won't until tomorrow morning.
Last week she didn't view my Thursday messages until Monday.
Do I need any more proof that this is not working out?
What else do I need?

I am so quick to dismiss explicit words about my own self worth,
and now I guess I also don't see these clear signals that I should stop.
If not because of her obvious lack of interest,
the excessive one on my end should be reason enough to put a stop to myself.

Mahsa sent me a message on Teams this morning.
She somehow couldn't log in, so she was asking me if I could upload a new
dataset from only the names of the files.
I did it in less than an hour.
Why am I very productive and efficient with stuff that has nothing to do with
my project?

Was it today or yesterday that I sent the first Tinder message?
I told that girl about the story with Alda and her liking her vibes.

"Emm, alright, I guess it's good(?)"

I didn't know what else could I say after that,
and so I just added _most probably_.
Surprisingly she hasn't deleted the match.
After that, I didn't really feel like sending another message to anybody else.

Around noon, I started drafting a response to Alex.
I might keep working on it after finishing these so I can send it before the
weekend.
I also told Johanna about my idea of the emails and told her that I would like
keep hearing from her.
She might reply back in the weekend, maybe next week, possibly never.

She could ignore my messages as easily as I've ignored hers,
or how I didn't open Alex's email until yesterday.

What flirty texts did I even want to send to Kate?
Why her specifically?
I have 6 other matches—5 if I ignore Marka—with whom I could chat.

Is it because we kissed?
I was pretty insistent before that.
Is it because she's French?

From where did this stupid fixation on French women even come from?
I liked Kate because her accent reminded me of Flore,
and I was infatuated with Flore, because her face reminded me of Monica.

So, there's that, I guess. Maybe I do still hold a crush on her.

I keep glancing at the e-mail hoping that I'll see Aliza's response.
I want to know.
Not knowing is exhilarating.
I sent out the secret, it's in the open now.
I'm waiting for a reaction, for the knowledge about how I was seen all this time.
Deep down I'm hoping—expecting?—to hear her surprise and reassurance that she
had no idea.
She'll probably tell me that she wasn't sure,
but suspected it after a while.
No, she saw the pin and make a comment.
From just that I should be expecting her to know.
How will I feel when she tells me that most of the people knew,
but they weren't actually shitheads so nobody really cared nor,
even less, talk about me behind my back.

The girls back in Mexico City did treat me with some sort of pity.
Did they really, or is it all in my head?

I fixed today the SSH configuration so I can log back in to Hyde from Tango.

The clock in this laptop is still carrying the time from back home.

I posted on Instagram a small video from 5 years ago of Nymi small like a rat
spinning in the air.
I miss her.

Alda shouldn't be back in a while.
I served myself a drink earlier today.
I don't know if I should read instead and continue with the draft later
tonight when I'm more drunk.

### Saturday, January 22nd, 2022
"Hay un artículo que dice que las personas guapas tenemos menos citas porque
intimidamos a los prospectos."

I can feel the symptoms getting stronger.
It could have been the weed and the alcohol, I guess.

I didn't get up until after noon.
I went to the laundry room and did a couple of loads.
For breakfast, at 14h30,
I made myself two sandwiches and then went back to bed to continue sleeping.

I keep checking the phone as if a new notification were to change all of my
problems or dark thoughts.
_Dark thoughts_, that's how the Dr refers to suicidal thoughts.
I haven't had those in a while.

The jokes with Monica don't really count.

I sent a couple of messages to the girls I matched with on Tinder.
One replied back, but the conversation didn't flow.
_What's the point, really?_
I kept thinking and just closed the conversation.

Again I keep thinking how,
if it were the case that they matched without reading my profile,
it's after the match when they would look into it to find the flag.
Could that be the reason why the conversations die quickly?
No, I don't think so.
I'm probably reaching.

I don't know what else to write about.
I didn't dream anything, or if I did, I remember nothing.
I haven't talked with Monica.
Sonny painted her hair.
Jose Luis sent me another message asking me to tell him more about my
PhD project and program, because it sounds so interesting.

Everyone's impressed by it.
What would happen if I flunked out?

My mom told me they sent the package with the blanket.
Several couriers didn't want to send it because it wasn't a new product with
an established price.
She sent me the guide telling me that the ETA is Wednesday.
If it doesn't pass customs, my Dad will have to pay the return trip as well.
It was more than 200 USD.
I should have brought it with me in a second suitcase.
I keep taking bad decisions.

I sent yesterday Alex's email.
I thought that I might back some responses this weekend,
but I might not get them in a while—or ever.
Monica specifically asked me if she could reply to me in an email.
Alex said how this opportunity of a sort of back-and-forth with someone who
shared similar experiences with them were just what they needed.
Aliza... she's the one whose email stresses me the most and the one on whom I
cannot really depend.
Were I in her shoes, would I reply back?
No, not really.
I would push it to the back of my mind and obsess about it for a couple of
days until I would be able to avoid it and repress it entirely.

What could anybody say to me after what I wrote?

This is the first night in this new website that I got a distraction.
I grabbed my phone and thought about posting a story in Instagram.
I went into the camera and posed for it,
thinking about what image of me I could put out there.
I want to be seen, but not really by anyone. And that bothers me.

Five hundred and forty words.
Two thirds of today's quota.
I'm almost there.

The messages are still unseen and unreplied.
I'm not sure what was the point of enabling back again the _seen_ feature.
Yeah, they're not seen yet, but does it really make a difference?
Would anything change if they were seen but unreplied?
They're there; put aside and ignored.

Either you're busy or not interested.
There were clear signs of interest.
She's apologized about it.
Why am I this needy?
I hate this.
I wish I could be more independent.
Why does it bother me this much to be alone?

Is it sex what I am looking for?

I touched myself this morning.
There were several drops in the sheets after I cummed.
They're not new, but they still make me uneasy.
This time, though, my panties were wet and messy afterwards.
There were spots even in my leggings.
I took a shower and did laundry.

I'll probably get a response after the weekend.
Perhaps the emails, maybe Kate.

I don't think I'll see her soon,
but at least I'll get an answer about the flirtatious texts.
What would happen if I don't get a response?
Would that make things better or harder?
No, I would need to get a clear message of I'm sorry but I'm not interested so
I could finally let this go.

I won't get that.

### Sunday, January 23rd, 2022
"Suddenly I'm feeling a sort of craving for you."

It's harder and harder to get up.
I will meet with Dr Perera the day after tomorrow.
She'll ask me how I've been feeling these past two months with the medication.
How have I been feeling?

At first they worked really good.
Then I should mention the observations I did with Calli,
I went to the other extremes.
I slept less and ate more.
Now that I am back here,
it's been ups and downs with my appetite and I feel more and more tired each day.
Will I mention the new drops when I touch myself?

After those past words I felt the unconscious urge to turn and glance at my phone.
Am I still expecting responses?
I considered moments ago writing a second email to Monica.

Then I started thinking about my fantasies with men and the social
pressure of heteronormativity in trans women.
This last sentence made me put my hand over the phone.
I reached and drank from my Vodka lemon twice before continuing.

Vodka-Lemon was the drink Johanna ordered in that bar in Granada,
it was the night that Fernando looked at us when we were dancing.
It was not the same night that we were at the club and the Mexican guide
defended me from that Spanish guy that was hitting on Johanna.
That other night was Sevilla,
and it was the same night when I thought about us sitting next to the river
as the moment of brief bliss that I experienced to answer Alice's question in
her kitchen.

Months ago I used to log into reddit and look up her username: SpadesFairy.
The first time the underlying motivation was expecting to read a pots or a
comment that would describe that night her in kitchen.
I was terrified to find a glimpse into her thoughts about me.
For someone who wrote two separate e-mails describing how I longed to be seen,
I was scared about knowing how she really saw me.

The last time that I did it,
I read instead how she had lost her job due to effects of her mental illness.
She was a writer.
She wrote silly stories for a dating simulator mobile game.
_Smut,_ she called it.

What is it with these women that I keep writing about them after meeting them
for a couple of hours?
Am I really this lonely?

I don't want to write about that anymore.

My drink is done.
I want another one.
I am high; Alda brought the second time a stronger batch.
The first one already made quite an effect on me.
An hour before she arrived, while I was only drunk and reading my book,
I considered telling her that I am trans.

_Alda, do you know that I am trans?_

Straight to the point and what I want to know.
No need of stories or explanations.
Does she know?

It's not that I want to share the knowledge or change the way the situation is
right now.
That's bullshit.
If that were the case,
I would have been rested after her question about my periods,
and the motivation to tell her became only stronger after that night.

What did I want to write to Monica?
It was something about my need for some man to fall in love with me,
why do I want to be seduced?
Then I wondered if we ever shared a night together.
We had sex, and then we slept together for an hour or two at most.
We slept for a whole night in the same house but in different rooms.

I dreamed about spending the night together more times than I dreamed about us
having sex.
Are we allowed to sleep together now?
As two best friends am I crossing some kind of line when I fantasize about
lying in bed under the same sheets,
holding her in my arms and feeling warm by her company?
There's nothing sexual about it, I think.
I don't want to kiss her.
I just wan to feel her close.
Share the intimacy of dreaming together.

She just sent me a couple of pictures of her for me to pick the best one.
Even though she's wearing a mask, I really liked the look of her face.
There must be something of the camera, that as soon as I saw her,
I wished to be in front of her and seeing the smile in her eyes.

### Monday, January 24th, 2022
"Todo hombre debería ser capaz de amar a la altura de ser amada por otra mujer."

The Vodka is done.

I managed to write a whole e-mail to Monica without mentioning Kate once.

When I deleted her conversation she hadn't seen still the last messages I sent.
I told her I would test my own self-control about not sending her any
messages—and I failed terribly—,
will I manage to do it still even if she later replies?
When I wanted to write these words earlier,
I had the fantasy deep down that it would be like last week and she'd send
something by the time I'd finish them.
This is all on me.
I did this to myself.
I am the one who doesn't quite know how to not let her feelings take control
nor grasp the fact that we don't really know each other.

I can't seem to accept that she's not interested in me.
I want it to be spelled out for me in such a way that it'd be impossible
for me to deny.
I won't go as far as to say that I've ruined anything,
because there is nothing really to ruin to begin with.

I am clearly not ready to be dating, be it casually or not,
and so I've deleted the rest of the apps.
I should focus on my program and the relationships that I already have.
I won't die from not having sex for another year.

Leonel, Monica's date, is also no more.
In her latest e-mail she told me how she doesn't think anything will happen
with him.
He proposed her to go to his house to watch movies _and stuff_.
She felt disgusted with what he was implying.
They never went on a real date, she explained,
and didn't want to start that way.
She knows she deserves better.
So, the next day when he sent her a message asking her how she was doing,
she didn't reply.

Is that what happened with Kate?
No.
It very well could had been, but it wasn't.

It wasn't what happened with any of the other girls either.

Honestly, even now I can see how I am being overly melodramatic again
for—oh god, really?—a couple of days of no answer.
Even though she'll probably reply later in the week as if nothing
happened—because most probably nothing did—this is reason enough to convince
me that this is not working for me and clearly won't.

I am not ready, emotionally nor mentally.
I feel right now the exact same way I felt that Sunday when I was waiting for
Molly's message after her camping trip.

_You didn't go to Ottawa, did you?
I mean, you have every right to go on a camping trip, I'd just like to know._

I feel as if I had just sent Flore the message asking about the gender of her
PI's mistery partner without knowing what would come after.

_BTW, can I be vulnerable with you? I know it's too much to ask,
specially after just two dates, but,
would you do me the favour of telling me if/when you lose interest in me?
You don't owe me any explanations or anything, I'd just like to know upfront._

These feelings are valid and human.
They're not particular to my trans identity, and even if they were,
it's normal that I'm feeling them.
They, like everything else that is bothering me right now, will eventually pass.

I should let myself feel this.
Let the sadness grasp my lungs,
and the insecurity punch my stomach,
and the frustration push me down to my seat.
They'll be over soon.

I finished yesterday my juice.
I ate today the meatballs.
The bottle of vodka is empty,
I am drinking the last of it with chamomille tea.

Alex has their appointment with a gender therapist today.
They would tell me all about it in their next email.
They mentioned in passing how they were hoping the write another one before it.

Aliza still hasn't written back.
She might never do it, I certainly would not blame her.
Johanna saw my message but didn't reply either.
Last time, it took her a couple of days as well.

Today, as I was browsing Facebook, the picture of Helena appeared in
the _People you might know_ banner.
I took a screenshot of her as if I had someone to whom I could mention it.

I'll grab my phone to see that the conversation I deleted hasn't somehow come
back and then I'll finish my drink before going to bed.

### Tuesday, January 25th, 2022
_Él me miraba con sus ojos noche y yo le creía lo que me decía...
Pero no lo volví a ver, luego no lo volví a ver y yo lo busqué._

How many nights will it take for me to stop waiting?
I keep thinking, still, of possible things I could write or say to reignite
something that will soon extinguish anyway.

It's like those days when I get anxious about something, anything
and I go from thinking it's the worst thing that could ever happen to me,
to realize that the problem,
even if it comes to the worst possible way it could be,
would be totally insignificant.
And I go from one end to the other, over and over.

I don't get it.
I sent the message to Johanna,
she might never reply back and I don't really care.
She could think my proposal is the most absurd and corny thing ever and roll
her eyes even before finishing my too-long message.
And, like I said, it's totally fine by me.
Why is it so different with this other woman who three months ago I didn't
even know she existed?

Right now I'm on the easier side of the pendulum.
I'll probably get a message eventually, maybe this weekend, perhaps other week.
There's the possibility, too,
that instead with time I'll just realize she hasn't liked or seen anything of
mine, and I'll wander into her profile to see how she stopped following me.
No, even typing it down it sounds so petty and stupid.
Something I would do, like deleting her messages after less than a week of silence.

I didn't say anything about the drops of cum to the Dr.
I lied and told her that I had been feeling fine,
only to correct myself and tell her about this sudden low mood.
I postponed the alarm until a couple of minutes before our scheduled appointment.
I had all of the intentions of not getting up after.
She suggested that I should try doing some exercise, getting out more often.
That motivated me to shower, and actually going out.

I took a couple of pictures but hated most of them.
I posted the only two I edited and a story of the video I sent to Sonny.

Vicky liked the post.
Two months ago I was worried that she would think I was a creep by following her.
I did like how she looked the last time that I logged to the lab meeting
yesterday afternoon.
I wouldn't pursue anything—pft, as if it depended on me, right.

Monica, Sonny, Paty, my mum, even Eduardo liked the images.
I keep watching the story walking down the stairs and I like how I look.

If I didn't know it was me, I'd think the picture is of a pretty woman.
I like my eyes and my hair.
I don't mind they're dark.
I don't mind anything in the picture.
I want to reach my hand through the screen and touch my own cheek,
take my mask off and tell myself these thoughts;
maybe coming from myself, my biggest judge, I would actually believe them.

I got Monica's and Alex's replies.
I haven't written them back.
This morning I got an email from Louis specifically addressed to me.
He was wondering if I considered submitting an abstract to AAIC about Qrater.

I cleaned the apartment today.
I ordered some food from Walmart, too.
It will get here tomorrow evening.
Thursday the next box will arrive.
Tomorrow also the box with my mom's gift will get here.
I thought sending Kate a specific message asking her if she wanted to see it.
I shouldn't.

It's two probable reasons why I haven't heard from her.
Either, like she herself have told me on repeated occasions,
she's busy and stressed with stuff, or she's actively ignoring me.
Neither of those would warrant reaching out, again.
I need to get a hold of myself.
Look within myself and find out why am I so needy.
What am I looking for?
When did I become this way?

Am I afraid of being alone?

I started wondering if I had talked to anyone today,
but I did have the phone conversation with Dr Perera.
I said _Hi_ to Alda when she left and I was cleaning.
I sent an audio to someone, probably Sonny.

I should work. I don't remember the last time that I did anything productive.

Is this what depression feels like?

### Wednesday, January 26th, 2022
"Seré tu diario cuando me lo permitas y aunque no lo logre—no pretendo—aliviar
tu carga, porque sé que los miedos e inseguridades vuelven,
pretendo hacer tu carga soportable.
Y cuando esas inseguridades regresen,
vuelvas a nuestra conversación donde te puedas sentir acompañada."

I've tried to write the responses to Alex and Monica but I can't.
I don't know what to tell them.
They asked me questions in their mails,
I have several thoughts that I wanted to share with them,
I feel a knot pressing the mouth of my stomach.
Why can't I find the words?

I've spent most of the day drafting an abstract of fewer than 350 words.
I can't keep asking Louis forgiveness for being such a shitty student.
This is eating me from the inside.

I turned off the alarm again.
I showered but didn't go out this time.
I shaved my legs even though I don't think nobody would notice them anyway.

I got my mother's package today.
I picked it up and took the opportunity to put a load of the sheets in the washer.
That was the excuse I used to motivate me to take a shower.
The pleasure of sleeping on clean sheets with freshly shaved legs.

When was the first time that I shaved my legs?
Was it middle school?
No, I don't think so.
It was probably high school, if not even college.

Probably those months that I didn't go to therapy, but it feels too late.

I remember trying my mom's nightgown.
That was middle school.
Even now, way more than a decade later, it still feels weird to acknowledge
those days.

I remember very clearly the exhilarating chill that I would get every time
the prefect would come to tell us that the next day there would not be any
classes.
That meant that I would have the house to myself.
It was those mornings when nobody was around that I went to explore that
closet.
I feel disgusted even though...
no, there was indeed something wrong about it.
I had no right to do that.
It was a complete invasion towards her privacy.

I stopped in high school, I think.
Around the same time that I started being interested in Monica.
She was my normalcy.
Was I depressed before or after finally meeting her?
I see the pictures of that first semester and I was very thin.
I went from being a chubby kid in middle school,
to being a slim young man in high school.
There's not more than a couple months of difference between those two time
periods.
I stopped eating; I stopped caring.

I don't want to talk about those days anymore.
I don't want to keep writing this.
I should finish the abstract.
Why is it so hard to focus?
Are the pills not working anymore?

I deleted the story about the Vodka and the tea.
Whose attention do I want? I do know that answer.

Today my mum package was supposed to arrive.
The Walmart groceries.
Tomorrow I'll go get my blood drawn and I'll receive the second box from
HelloFresh.
I should cancel them from now on.

I still feel like crying even though I am not sure why.
Is it really that I don't know or is it that I don't want to admit it and
writing down?
I feel some sort of pride completing another day's worth without mentioning
her again, even though years from now if I come back to these words,
I'll remember this period of time as the time when I couldn't really take her
out of my head and was ashamed by it.

Is it the kiss, is it the second date?
Am I sure I want to have sex with her if I am struggling this hard after a
single fucking kiss?
In my head it's as if somehow after that event happening the urge would be
satisfied and I would be able to continue on with my life.

But that's not what's going to happen.
What is it, precisely, what I actually want?
Do I want a response, attention?

She could, right now, send me a text message apologizing about not seeing
them and telling me that she's been so busy.
Would that make me feel better?
What if she just replies with another smiling emoticon?
Would that be better or worse?

What is it that I want?
What is it that could fix this hurt I am feeling?
Is it being ignored?
Is it feeling lonely or not as important?

The problem is within me, I am the one who should be able to fix it. But, how?

### Thursday, January 27th, 2022
"Nunca le he contado a nadie, pero a veces tengo recuerdos así,
de haber crecido siendo una niña.
Es como si quien soy ahora de alguna forma se escurriera a mis memorias y
tintara de feminidad mi pasado."

"A mí me lo contaste.
En dos ocasiones de maneras distintas.
La primera cuando te acercaste a mí por primera vez y me dijiste que te parecía
conocida a una amiga del kinder.
Incluso me dijiste que pensabas que yo me llamaba Sofía.
La segunda vez me dijiste en la universidad cuando me decías que no sabías
si eras trans.
Me dijiste que tenías recuerdos siendo niña."

I told Alda, half-joking, if sending another another text on a different
application wouldn't count as quadruple-texting.
She laughed.

By then Kate did reply back in Instagram.
I saw how she posted several stories sledding with her roommate.
She had green eyeshadow and stuck her tongue out in the first picture.
The others were videos of them sliding down the snow.
The last ones though, those were different.
In the first one she screamed, her french accent bending her voice.
Then, she said something along the lines of _Tell God this Bitch is coming_.

Then, like her, suddenly they were gone.
I considered sending her a message about the sledding—even now although she
hasn't replied the other ones I'm still considering somehow—, but when they
disappeared I couldn't hold it anymore and just did.
She answered immediately telling me that they weren't supposed to be seen;
they were for her mother.
Two other people and me managed to see them and text her laughing.
We continued for another round of messages and then my last one went unseen.

I went to get my blood drawn.
I slept maybe three hours at most.
The e-mail I sent to Monica,
I started it a couple of minutes before 3h and it was sent an hour and a half
later.
She replied back today,
but I haven't found the time to answer neither to her nor Alex.

Melissa—was it yesterday—tagged me in a post in Facebook that said something
having a message with a friend pending.
She might write me soon.
I still haven't heard anything from Aliza.

I sent a message to Vicky on Teams about the batteries of her mouse.
They were playful without being cringe nor creepy,
or at least to my own perception.
Tomorrow we'll meet the Colombian guy that lives here in Montreal.
He's going to come at 11h.

I had a new match on Tinder.
I opened it and saw a familiar face.
I think we matched on Bumble, before.
She was the last one I had before I deleted the app.
It must have been that one because Tinder stopped working for me.
No, it was Tinder.
It was way back to the first time I deleted it.
As soon as I saw the notification I sent her a GIF of Brie Larson singing.
_Hello again, friend of a friend_.

She didn't see it.

When I woke up I had a notification from tinder, too.
It wasn't just a match but a new message.
I replied back trying to write more than just the usual how're you doing?
The conversation was going to die anyway,
so I went straight to the point and asked what she was looking for in the app.
She said that nothing in particular, just to have fun.
I asked her if it had been working for her and she said yes.

She asked me if she could ask for my orientation.
At first I thought she meant about my gender,
but she dismissed it when I asked her if that was what she meant.
When I asked her why, she said what I was half-expecting.

I told her I wouldn't be up to being in a threesome with a guy.
Although, to be honest, after talking for a bit I started considering it.

"Yeah, sorry."

"That's fine. I am still down for you." She replied.

"I'm trans, though, is that ok to you?"

"Sure."

Even then I thought I wouldn't hear from her again.
She instead asked me for my snapchat.

I might never hear from her again, but even then,
somehow I feel a little better inside.

_The feminine urge to post shitty after shitty IG story until your crush
mindlessly and quickly breezes through them and you foolishly think she saw them._

"Alda, I'm saying it right now, mark my words,
from this point onwards I give up on Kate."

### Friday, January 28th, 2022
"Sí, la neta sí.
Nadie está tan ocupada para no responder un mensaje.
O sea, qué le cuesta si _tanta emoción_ le da un mensaje tuyo."

I went into my contacts and deleted Kate's number from my phone.
Even after that, I kept thinking about the possibility of ironically asking her:
_so, how's the camping trip to Ontario?_

It'd be more pathetic than closure-giving.
I'm sure I'd regret it as soon as I'd send it.
What even could I expect to happen?
Either it'd also go ignored like the last text I sent to Flore,
or she'd play the fool and apologize for not replying this week— like the time
I asked her about my changing numbers.

Why would she keep talking to me and referring to the hypothetical future
meeting?
Why did she kiss me a second time before my departure?
Why would her cheeks change colour after she pulled away?

Will I reply to her if she eventually reaches out again,
be it a couple of days, or weeks from now?

In the morning Vanessa—I couldn't remember her name earlier today—sent me a
text asking me how I was.
I considered the idea of asking her again if she'd still be interested in the
threesome with his guy.
I know he might not be.
Most straight guy wouldn't—maybe even most bi, too.
I was surprised by her _I'm still down for you_.

I wasn't that attracted to her picture, but, being honest,
I wasn't either towards Flore's nor Kate's.

Will I go through all this shit with her, too?

Nico's the name of the guy that will sublet the room from Jose Luis.
He came this morning to see the apartment and the room.
Fortunately, he didn't come at 10h.

Although I woke up on my own close to 8h,
I stayed in bed and touched myself thinking what could happen with this new girl.
I came in my shorts and they got wet.
I should mention it when I talk to Dr Perera next time.

He had his nails painted black.
I know that doesn't mean anything necessarily, but would he be queer?
I sensed that both he and his cousin were a little messy with my pronouns sometimes.

I'm thinking about telling Alda again.

I thought telling her, no, asking her first if she've ever had a threesome,
and that I was tempted by the idea.

Do I have any Vodka left?
No, I finished the whole bottle that other day that I felt sick.

I keep thinking about Kate and I hate it.
I hate me because of it.

_It's a normal feeling to have._

Bullshit, the hell it is.
It's not normal to be feeling like this for a woman that I've seen twice and
kissed once.

_What did I do?_ I pretend to think, but fuck that.
I know what I did.
I came too strong.
The flirtatious texts weren't flirty but annoying and insistent and needy.
I'm starting to feel angry.
Why do I have to be like this?
Why can't I be better?

Why do I have to feel so lonely?

I sent Alex an email and considered writing another to Monica.

Aliza might still be in some other country.
I think I remember seeing something from her, about her, I don't know.

Kate posted a story today, I mean, she posted several.
The personal ones were about the meal that her roommate cooked.
Then she posted one of her more impersonal ones promoting other people's posts.
This time it was a collection of _places to meet queer women and nb peolple_.
I reacted with a _100_ emoji.
I thought the normal face with the heart eyes was too much.

I indeed found it useful.
Now that I think about it, even though it wasn't a conscious thought,
I can't say that I wasn't hoping she'd reply with something like
_for even more options!_

She didn't even see it.
She hasn't seen the message I sent her yesterday in the afternoon.
It was creepy, too, though.
So, I can see how she would purposefully ignore it.

I deleted the reaction.
I hope she didn't notice.
The thought about the possibility about hearing from her in the near future
gets dimmer and dimmer.

I considered sending a message to Eliseo,
but I also hated how I told everyone after our kiss.
It's like if the more people knew, the more real it became.

Maybe I can go out this weekend and take some pictures.

### Saturday, January 29th, 2022
"Hey Kate, are you, uh, like going on a weekend trip to Ontario?"

Today, again, it was one of those days.
I don't what I hate more sometimes,
if the situations that bring me down like this or my own weaknesses that make
me such a victim to these dark moments.

I slept most of the day.
I don't remember what I was dreaming those last few hours.
Does it really matter?
It's not like I actually believe that there is some hidden meaning into my own
psyche in those weird images and lives.

I remember being in the dark in Tijuana's house.
There was a problem with a laptop computer sitting in the kitchen and I
couldn't figure out the electricity breakers.

Am I really talking about dreams instead of the humiliation I felt after
sending two enormous text messages to Kate after deleting her phone number
precisely so I wouldn't contact her.

I saw the three blinking dots that meant she wasn't going to keep ignoring me
with this last plead of help.
Then they disappeared for those very brief moments of time that somehow feel huge,
which also meant that her answer would be uncomfortable.
I breathed deeply as if I were preparing for a hit in the chest,
I closed my eyes like I did a couple of days ago when I knew that the needle
was going to pierce my skin, and,
even though I knew the pain wouldn't kill me, I felt scared.

"Hey Sofía, I hope you're well! I'm not going to Ontario,
but I am not seeing much people and I do get anxious at too many messages.
I don't know if some of your stories about ghosting were about me or a crush
that isn't me, but I've been feeling pressured.
I'm already horrible at answering and staying constant with plans these days.
But I do hope my radio silence hasn't given you negative emotions!
And I'm sorry if it did!"

I barely read it once.
I started over-explaining in an almost incomprehensible ramble of ideas and
apologies.
I closed my phone after muting the conversation and put it away.
Did I fall asleep just then?
I didn't grab it again until the morning.

The last time I woke up it was around 13h or 14h.
I was crying when I saw Sonny's notifications in Snapchat.
It was a picture of her so I reciprocated with one of me.

I got up, and opened the conversation.
I didn't expect an answer but I didn't know if she'd seen the message.
She did.
I knew it wouldn't make me look nor feel any better,
and it certainly wouldn't do anything for her,
but I still decided to send another one.

And I was right, it didn't do me any good.
She saw it.
She didn't say anything.
I told her I wasn't expecting her to.

Did I really have a (hipo)manic episode?
I feel like that time when I was in Tae Kwon do.
I did something bad and got reprimanded.
Then I started crying about the pain of my recent surgery.

Am I using this as some sort of excuse for my shitty behaviour?

Why do I keep grabbing my phone?

I deleted Kate's conversation and don't have any evidence of what those messages said.
I remember asking her to tell me whenever she'd lose interest in me.
I asked her too if I could still reach out to her.
They were very pathetic.
In the last, more coherent one of today,
I remember telling her to scratch those requests.

"You don't owe me any explanations or friendship of anything after just two dates.

"I'd love to hear from you again in the future,
be it a week or a month or whenever, but it's also OK if I don't.
Sorry again, and thanks for being so nice about this."

Will I? Hear from her again?
I might still see her pictures and stories.
She hasn't blocked me—could I really blame her if she had?—so she probably won't.
Now that I read again her message it feels so carefully worded,
and yet I'm sure she doesn't plan them nor think much about them.

I hate how nice she was.
I hate how even after this,
I can read her and have the smallest and pitiful bit of hope that I will hear
from her.

I shouldn't.
I am even considering blocking her just so she won't be able to.

### Sunday, January 30th, 2022
"Disculpa estos doce días de silencio, aunque no me lo creas,
a lo mejor tu narcisismo sí, estos días he estado pensando en tus mensajes
y formulando en mi mente una respuesta.
Porque, ¿sabes? Me siento presionada por darte una respuesta igual de brillante
a la tuya, efectos de la idealización,
ya que desde que te conozco te considero una mujer muy inteligente con un
sarcasmo que no haya cambiado en el transcurso de los años
(seguro aquí vas a sonreír, porque pienso que es algo inherente a ti)."

I feel the need to tell everyone, again, what happened with Kate even though
I'm also embarrassed by it.
Why do I have this need to share something that I wish wouldn't have happened?

Even though I told myself that I would stop publishing Instagram stories after
feeling humiliated by the oversharing nature of the past ones and the
transparency of their references, I kept doing it today.

Kate mentioned feeling pressured by the ones related to ghosting.
I felt seen and not in a good way.
At the same time, isn't that what I really wanted?
I knew then that she actually stops to see what they say.
Maybe not all, maybe not always.

I still look for her name in the list of people to satisfy an unreachable
itch of being thought of.

_I will not forget about you!_, she told me once.
It was a response about how I would keep texting her so she wouldn't.
She added it as an afterthought and yet it made me smile more than the rest of
her response.

It's been almost two months since the last time that I saw her.
I probably won't see her before that mark and I'll possibly won't see her again at all.
I won't feel better until I let myself be OK with the idea that it is over.
That whatever happens, there's nothing else I can do to force it.
I already have done too much to make it awkward.

I keep going back to the picture of that last message as if trying to find some
hope in it.
Why am I so reluctant to being alone?
To whom, and what am I trying to prove when I'm looking into having sex?
Why does the word _normal_ keep coming to my head?

I am not normal.
Not because I can't have sex like the cis people—or other trans people.

Tomorrow I'll see Calli.
Thinking back again into these past few days,
the idea of having an hypomanic episode just feels like an idea to excuse my
behavior, a label to put on the actions and feelings that I don't want to own.
_It wasn't me, see, I wasn't thinking straight._

I feel uncomfortable that I keep thinking about her,
writing about her here and to so many people,
that I have this unbearable urge to reach out and get a response from her.
I think how she can leave my messages for the next day—or week—,
how she must not think about me with anyone of her life,
and that most probably the choice of seeing me again is not even a choice at all.

I feel my eyes getting full,
but I'm not sure if I want to cry of sadness or shame.

I wish I could find someone that feels to me the way I do about her.

Sonny does and I pushed her away.
Girls on the apps have started to show those tendencies and those were the
reasons that I discarded them.

She was the one that sent me the first message and proposed meeting.
I wasn't even that excited about seeing her that first evening.
When Alda asked me how the date had gone, I sincerely didn't know myself.

When did I start to get these intense feelings?
Was it her message about feeling the same way?
Was it, on the other hand, her mentions to a future meeting mixed with a cool
indifference to when or if it would ever happen?

Was it the kiss or the faint promise of something more?
Was that what the red blush meant to me, a promise,
or was it the interest that I was looking for?

_Silly crappy pandemic._

Maybe after things go down again.
Maybe if I am able to let the weeks go by without doing anything more she might
some day send something casual like she did those days between Christmas and
New Year's Eve.

Or, perhaps, by then, it really won't matter.

## February, 2022

### Wednesday, February 2nd, 2022
I can't think of a quote today.
No, I was blocked.
There's the perfect one that my subconscious must be trying to hide from me.

_Yesterday I wore a skirt in the middle of winter and I felt so proud,
I got this urge to tell you. Wasn't sure if I should._

That's the potentially last message.
I don't know what would be worse, if it ends up being the case, or if it won't.

Two days ago I went to my therapy session.
Calli didn't give me the impression that she believes I had a manic episode.
We talked about Kate, how she wasn't valuing the feelings I have towards her.
I cried, a lot, but it wasn't necessarily after that intervention or
even because of Kate.
It had to do with the way I am feeling about myself.
It's like my emotions are the ones in control of me.

I despise not being in control.

I wore a skirt—the brown one that my grandma made for me.
I took a picture to share it as a story.
I wanted to send it to her.
No, that's not true;
I certainly didn't want to send her anything, but I did want her to see it.

As I was talking with Calli about not trusting people's good impressions about me,
she offered me a compliment out of our framing.
She told me how, as soon as I got in,
the first thought that got to her head was that she wanted to tell me how my
hair looked fabulous;
how the way I had particularly styled it that day was so pretty and beautiful.
I smiled.
I believed her.
I welcomed her thought.

That was Monday, the first day that I didn't write in here.

I didn't send the message then.

That night I cooked with Alda.
We made the chorizo burgers and watched a show in Crave.
_Yellowjacket._

I posted a story in Instagram about our night together.
I wanted to appear as of be having a life.
That morning Kate had posted one herself—no, she re-shared one of her
roommate where she was playing with his cat.
She was wearing sweatpants and long socks with sandals;
her hair to her waist brushing her brown sweater.
She ran towards the cat threatening to catch her.
And then, in her accent, she told her that she'd go home.
She threw a last look towards the room and the video cut.

I watched it easily 20 times.
And with every time she'd look into the room as if she were glancing at me
I hated myself a little bit more.

Yesterday I posted an image I stole from Irene,
the girl who started the whole Twitter Fiasco with Yaaj.
The picture was of a taped box with the words Damaged Bottom written in marker.
I posted it on Instagram with a different caption: _My Tinder Profile._

Yomar laughed at it.
Then, Vicky.
She reacted and I lied telling her that I had forgotten that she follows me.
She told me not to be embarrassed and that it was hilarious.
_She was laughing with me_, she assured me.
Finally, Antonija laughed in all caps, as if she were excited.

Just recently I told Monica how I suspect she might be bi.
She's in a long-term relationship with a boyfriend,
so would it even matter if she is?
Of course it does.
What am I saying?
That'd make her queer, like me.

I keep thinking back to Vicky and Kate.
Wasn't what I wanted with Vicky a platonic friendship?
Wasn't I regretting that after being rejected by Kate I would lose, then again,
the contact of another queer person with similar experiences to mine?
Then why am I discarding those exact things of Antonija just because she's not
sexually available?

Last night was when I send the message.
I took a screenshot and then deleted the conversation before she read it.
I have no way of knowing if she has read it,
other than sending her another message and waiting her to see that one.
Was that the reason why I deleted the conversation?
No, it was to force me to not gain anything from opening it again.

But I keep doing it.

I woke up today and saw she had posted several stories in the early morning.
The first one was another one of her roommate's.
She was studying Arabic;
writing on a notebook or sheets of paper in front of a laptop.
Then some of her usual ones, and lastly three pictures of her cat.
They were posted around 2h or 3h.
Hours after my message, so she must have read it.
The text over her roommate's story read:
_at this point Hany and I only use Instagram to document each other's daily
lives and Leïla's life ofc._

Was she writing it for me again?
Why would she?
I believed she wasn't really paying attention to my stories yet she mentioned
them in her—only—reply.

I took a video today for a story.
I liked how I look in it.
I've seen it several times and know that if I were someone else,
I'd feel attracted to me.

When I went to see if she had seen it, Paty was the first and only viewer.
I posted that with a caption saying
_my crush giving me the attention I've been begging for._

I specifically wanted her to see that one, too.
I spent all day looking if she had seen them,
or when was the last time she had been online.

It gave me the idea to propose to Alda do some sort of _dignity jar_.
Like a swear jar, but, instead of putting money every time we cuss,
we would for every time that we reach out to the people we've been obsessing
over.

We didn't find a piggy bank in Dollarama.
We didn't come empty handed, though, I got Nico's tuna cans, some hangers,
and sponges;
I deposited Nico's share of the rent and,
by then, Kate had both seen the stories and, still, not written anything.

### Thursday, February 3rd, 2022
I was looking at old pictures and I kept thinking:
_Mmmhm, I would totally make out with young me._
The real question is, though... _Would he find me attractive?_

"Moni, do you ever think I'm pathetic?"

I deleted the question less than a minute after I sent it.
She came online not much after.

I cooked the bowl of rice and sausages with two fried eggs and ate in my room.
I was watching an episode in Netflix about something—which is still
unfinished—and then I sent her something else.
What was it?

Right; I had to go check in my phone.
It was about that picture.

Earlier today Kate posted a bunch of stories about her office.
I recognized the building that was seen outside the window.
She was so close.
In one of them she showed the picture of the pride flag.
I reacted to her story with a fire emoji.
I think the main reason behind that was to see if she'd see it.

She did.
I deleted the conversation again.

We put the dignity jar in the living room now.
Yesterday, Alda and I went to buy it but didn't find a piggy bank.

The prices are there.
From this morning until now, I've put close to 10 CAD.
I wanted to post a story about it;
let her know that I regret my behavior,
that I know I've done wrong by violating her boundaries.

That story alone would cost me 5 CAD, and I still wanted to post it.

Alda told me not to, it'd be embarrassing. She was right.

I saw another image of a Valentine's candy with the words
_I'll ghost you and then watch your Instagram stories for years_
posing in a profile picture of tinder.
That was another image that I considered posting even though it would cost me
more than just the 5 CAD.

I felt lonely and embarrassed, so I went to Snapchat and took a nude video to
send that girl.
In there, I noticed a filter that made my eyes rounder and my cheeks fuller.

I felt like that other time years ago when I played with the feminizing AI
that supposedly changes your gender.
The face was almost the same except for a very subtle details.
This time, looking at the picture, you can barely notice that it is altered.
That was the thing I sent to Monica hours after my vulnerable question.

Instead of replying about the picture that I would later share as a story—which
Kate saw quickly enough that I didn't have to pay more than 50 cents to know
that information—she asked me what I had asked her.

I told her the truth;
_a question that I later regretted and didn't want an answer to._

She asked me why would I want fuller cheeks when women want them slimmer.
That led us to talk about her friend unto which I had a crush,
and then our time in high school, and pictures of us then.

I saw the pictures of me and Helena.
I think of it how we did go out several times.
We stayed together that day when we explored Portugal with Polo.
Was it the same day that we went to Braga,
when we walked the streets of the city on our own?
Was that the same night that we danced and kissed?
The night that she took me out of the club to tell me how,
even though I was a nice guy, she just wanted to dance.

I met her later at that picnic by the river.
That was the picture I saw, where we were seating next to each other.
Then, finally, we went into the cathedral of Salamanca.
I just found that picture.

I feel the urge again to reach out to her.
She's married, she has a family now.

Why do want to do this?
Is it that I want to ask her about the journal?
That would be such a stupid thing yet just imagining having a response fills
me with excitement.

I told Anahí that I'm considering posting the story with the old picture of me.

It'd mean that I would no longer be living stealthily.
Alda, Armando and Jose Luis would know.
Vicky would know, too.
Antonija as well.
Kate surely does now, but she'd see that old me;
she'd no longer be attracted to me —if somehow she still is.

Everyone from Mexico City would get to see the image that I left behind.
Why do I want to do this?

Because,
just like the excitement I get when I think about getting a reply from Helena,
imagining this makes me feel both lighter and free.

### Friday, February 4th, 2022
"Entonces qué, ¿quieres ser mi catadora platónica de nudes?"

Having the change in coins so easily available is not doing wonders for my
purpose of actually stopping looking her up.
It has stopped me.

I sent the picture of the jar and the fines to Monica and she reacted in a
way that surprised me.
She just posted two words, _love it_,
instead of the normal reaction of ignoring my messages when I aboard a
subject that she doesn't really want to touch.
Like when, moments later, I explained to her precisely how this jar has
stopped me from posting the text about reacting to stories and the cartoon of
the Valentine's candy.

I didn't want to get out of bed this morning.
It's not that I am tired,
but I don't find a reason good enough to actually start my day.

I should have one.

It's not healthy how, now that I think of it,
I deposit unto other people my daily drive.

I was just talking with Monica last night about, when I was in
High School, I would go every morning to sit on that bench—_la banquita de
la soledad_—to play my odds and wait if I would see her pass by.

Then, in college, I would wait to talk to Catherine in our cars or keep
chatting until the early morning with our phones.

I've never been really alone.

After my childhood I started being with Monica.
We never really stopped, even after I started seeing Catherine.
There was that messy period of time when I was with both of them and neither.
I transitioned and kept Catherine by my side.
She was my girlfriend even well into the times when she wasn't anymore.
Las Vegas in July.

Six months of being single before I met Sonny—to whom I actually just sent a
picture of my breasts—with whom I almost had sex a couple of months ago.

We broke up last year.
Only one year other than those six months have I been single in my whole adult
life.

I've been an adult for more than a decade;
I've been an adult way more than I've been Sofía.

Being alone should do me fine.

In our social meeting Anka called me out for being silent.
Was she noticing that I had just left my phone on the table?
No, I always make sure that its presence is ambiguous in the webcam's view.

She said how she doesn't know anything about me:
how's my life, how I've been doing, living here.
It would be fun to right then and there blurt out
_well, I used to be a dude, and now I am a depressed sexy woman._

Vicky was talking about her cats.
I remember another meeting watching her talk,
there was something in the cadence of her words that annoyed me.

Why?
Why do I even care?
Do I want to be friends with her because I like her?

I kept thinking about her with my urge to posting that old picture of me.
Her and Antonija and Kate.
The three of them look similar in my mind.
They're supposed to be at three different levels of interest to me.
One is my friend—with friend in very interesting quotes—with whom I shared a
room for one week, the other is my labmate with whom I share a sort of queerness,
and the last one is the girl who, up until a certain point,
I shared a mutual attraction—did I?—and spent two dates and two kisses together.

One kiss for every meeting.

_I'll give you another one before you go_,
were those the words she said when we were centimeters away from each other?

I was just thinking how peculiar it would be if those had
been her last words spoken to me, but they weren't.
When she took the metro,
he looked at me still flustered and mumbled about how she was going to text me.

And now she doesn't.

She keeps seeing my Instagram stories, though.

I went out for a walk to buy some alcohol and chips.
I took my camera with me.
This time I did use it.

I posted two pictures in my profile,
two of the same view but with different focus points.
I have another draft with another three to post later in the weekend.

Will Kate like them?
Will she just keep seeing my stories without reaching out like those images I
didn't post.

I guess that would be better than being blocked.
But if that's the case, it won't last long.
It will, eventually, get to the point that I will reach out and get blocked or
get sick and unfollow her completely.

### Saturday, February 5th, 2022
"Está claro que estás en un carrusel del que no te sabes bajar.
Pero ya estás cansada, harta, dolida de ti misma,
entonces creo que pronto te vas a bajar.
.O te vas a aventar.
Y te va a doler la caída y vas a estar mareada un buen rato.
El tiempo que se requiera.
Pero vas a salir."

I don't remember if I looked for her after posting the cooking stories.
I must have, but I don't recall it.

Alda and I finished the show we were watching.
I didn't smoke again, I was a bit drunk.
It would be better if I keep a better tally of the times that I should put
money in the jar.

I posted two stories today even though I woke up with the intention of not
posting anything.
I posted the pictures as well.
They got even less attention than the ones from yesterday.
Do I care, really?
Even Vicky liked one of those posts and I felt nothing.
I am fixated on why Kate stopped liking my posts—and me.

I do know.
I came too strong, too desperate.
_Manic dependance_ was what that Youtube video said.
It's not like I showed signs of it, I'm literally experiencing it right now.

I feel sad about the loss of something that never got to happen.
Is this masculine?
Does this have anything to do with the socialization about thinking that I
deserve whatever I want?
The false belief that I am a protagonist.

I follow fewer than 300 people on Instagram.
I don't see everyone's stories.
I watch all of hers.
She's seen all of mine.
She follows five times the number of people I do.

_Will ghost you but watch your Instagram stories for years._

I got distracted with Anahí's messages in Instagram.
Paty also replied now to the comment I left in her story.

I've been considering posting a picture of me in the old days.
Let the secret that's been haunting me for so long in the open.
Invite chaos to reign over me.
Things with Kate will never come back in any case, this way...

No, this doesn't have anything to do with her, does it?
How would I feel if I post it and this is the story that she doesn't see?
Maybe this does have a bit to do with her.

She watched the one of the turkey stuffing.
I posted another one after.
It was a picture from yesternight,
with a small caption at the bottom stating that I was going to post something
that I'd immediately regret, so, instead there was a picture of me.
Anahí replied to it, telling me that I didn't want to pay more for it.

I sent her the draft of me with short hair in Argana.
We talked about it and I told her how I have this temptation to post it.

I don't know what I am expecting from it.
I am fishing for responses, that I know.
I want attention and I need it badly.

But what sort of reactions?
I told Anahi that I might get some kind of _Who's that?_.
I imagined Alda asking me that.
I even thought about responding: _Male Sofia_, or even _me, if I were a guy_.
I could get just surprises, both from knowing now that I am trans—maybe Armando?—,
or from finally seeing how I looked before—that'd be Eliseo or Paty.

Where would Vicky fit in there?
Antonija?
Would Kate respond at all?
I don't think so.

After posting that, I don't think I would be able to reach out.
Nothing would be any different, really,
but there is something deep inside that I cannot explain that just tells me that
I'd be forfeiting that option for ever.

Do I even have it anymore?

I've kept thinking about it.
Asking for clarifications, _I'll never get to go to the cat café, ain't I?_, or...

Even here, I am getting sick of having the same thoughts over and over.

I had two matches in Tinder.
I sent a message that also went unreplied.
With the other one I didn't bother.

I got a response, though.
I wasn't really expecting that.
I had asked the woman what was the last song that was stuck in hear head.
She replied with something that I, honestly, have no idea what it means.

I'll probably just ignore it.
I guess the matches and that response mean that there's nothing wrong with Tinder,
it's just me.

Just now I thought about removing the trans flag from my profile.

Wouldn't that be going back to that same issue of before?
I'd have to tell them before the first date anyway.
It'll hurt seeing them go away,
realizing that they were interested beforehand and that small detail of who I
am is what drove them away.

Right now, at this exact moment,
I'll possibly both delete the subtle mention of my dating profile that I am trans
and I'll also post an image of how I looked when I lived as a guy.

### Sunday, February 6th, 2022
_I fall in love so easily because half of the relationship is in my head._

I did both things and, just like I had suspected—worried?—, nothing special happened.

The number of people that have liked me in the app is still the same.
No new matches in there—I had one,
I think, on the other one, but I will just let it die out.

After posting the picture of _him_, I kept checking the viewers religiously.
At first, only people that knew him and saw him saw the story.
Then Kate showed up in that list.
Then little by little it started getting more viewers,
but by then I had stopped checking it.

I saw Carolina's text last night telling me how she had a crush on him.
I knew it when it happened.
I didn't mention about me having one on her for a brief period of time in high school.
It wasn't sincere,
even at that moment I was aware that it came mostly from a pathological need to
experience a _normal_ relationship.

This morning, I looked at my phone and saw a text from Yomar.
He also had a crush on me when I was a him.
His text was sweeter—even though he plagued it with most of the buzzwords
cis people love using.

Anahí and Alex both encouraged me.
I considered writing Alex another e-mail,
I owe them the story about my first urge to kiss a man.

Almost all of the people I fantasized about seeing it have seen it by now.
The only person who's not aware of my looks that reacted was Francisco.
Francisco reacted with a surprised face.
I replied to him saying that he was the first one.
He asked me if he was my brother.
He knows I am trans and yet he still thought that he was my brother.
Is that the validation I was looking for?

I considered posting another one,
but it would only be more indirect messages instead of doing what I actually want.
What is it that I want, though?

I started this day's log with a quote from Euphoria,
it's from Jules' session with her therapist.
I thought I could talk about the need I keep having about posting meaningless
stories in Instagram and looking for Kate in the viewers.

As I was telling Alda, I don't really understand why do I do it.
Is it knowing she saw them?
But, why?
Why does it matter?
I posted about my arrival to Canada and she still didn't know it.
I am not on her mind; not even close to the amount she's in mine.

What is it that I hate about that?
Is it the amount of time that I spend thinking about her or that it is
incomparable to the time I must spend on hers?

I sent the message to Helena and it'll probably go ignored.
Can I really blame her?

I don't even know if she's fine with trans issues.
Why do I keep begging for attention?
For someone who surely was so proud of how well she could deal with loneliness,
I am struggling a lot with isolation these months.

I really don't feel about talking more about Kate.
I wish I could see her, but it's not that.
I wish I could touch her and kiss her.
If I were to see her again in a purely fraternal way,
I would be disappointed.

I had the opportunity to hook-up with someone else and I didn't pursue it.
It's not just sex that I want.

But, I let myself go too far and that bridge is unstable, probably burnt.

If she ever does think about me or talk with other people about that girl she met once,
she would end the stories stating how I was too eager and needy.
I reminded her how she's not in a mental space to be in a serious relationship.
My actions were what made her sure that we were not compatible.

Me wanting her was what ultimately caused me not getting her.

Every day I keep writing how I'm getting sick of having this same conversation
over and over, and I keep coming back to it.

In my e-mail to Monica I wrote her how last night Alda came to tell me about
her night with Karina and Flor.
They mentioned me, the latter is excited to meet me.
Maybe next week we'll paint.

I ordered myself some pizza.
I don't feel like cooking or doing anything.

### Monday, February 7th, 2022
"lol give it a month; on 7th of march;
you can send her a _fuckboi_ message for free"

I'm sitting in front of Alda.
She's staring at her computer.
We're both working; we had talked about coming to the living room and do
something productive together in way that'd make us feel pressured to actually work.

It has worked.
We even took some Adderall, mixed it together with a relaxant and some weed.
_I feel like we're mixing our uppers with our downers_, I joked with her.
I think it's not necessarily a perfect fix as I've noted how I tend to overfocus
on some ideas or on activities that have nothing to do with my current task.
Is this what having ADHD feels like?

Even having the line of thought from my last paragraph in my head is almost impossible.
I keep glancing at my phone.
I haven't posted any story today and it feels weird having nothing to open up and check.

I do have something.
Last night at around 1h I saw she was online.
She had just posted a story.
The previous night she put up a video taken by her roommate where she lays
her hand on his forehead will carefully, with the other hand, she's painting his eyes.
In this one, she shares another story from his with a picture of her upper
right eye posing with some colorful little packing peanuts.
I send her a comment.
She saw it in the morning, but didn't acknowledge it.
That time in December when I commented similarly in a picture of her wearing a blazer she said thanks.
Perhaps it's right what Alda said and she's not answering back on purpose.

Why would she keep following me then?

I feel like I'm seeing one of those guys that keep insisting on women.
_Why doesn't she blocks me then if I'm not bothering her._ Ugh.

What mixed signals are these?
There is nothing she's doing to make me think that she wants me to pursue her.
Why is it that I can't see the obvious?

I had the urge to enlist the sides of each one of our latest interactions,
but it was a moving impulse towards an amputated finger.
I don't want to see it.
Because it's painful how pathetic it is.

A comment on that picture.
The reaction towards the gay flag—these are not painful yet.
A shy mention of my urge to share with her that I had worn a skirt in
the cold—this one starts to sting.
The, barely, more level-headed apology to my manic dependent texts of the night
before in which I tell her that I will wait for her to reach out.
The desperate manic-induced attempt of an apology that tended heavily towards
overexplanation.
Then hers—finally—; a calm and nice explanation that,
while she wasn't ghosting me, she did feel pressured by my indirects,
a sincere apology for any caused negative emotions,
and a subtle hint that our casual, non-exclusive, non-serious thing would not work out.
Me again with a straight-to-the-point questioning of whether she's actively
ignoring me—if it would have started and ended with this,
it wouldn't have been so bad; I guess this is where I fucked it up.
A comment following up on her stories saying that I—creepily—might follow his
roommate—typing this, I imagined her disgusted reaction to herself
after glancing at the notification;
which could also explain why she's still checking my stories.
Her explanation to my question about her deleted stories.
The ignored question in Whatsapp about the blanket my mum made.
My triple-texting—which I didn't save, but, when I read from memory,
I feel its the source of the stench of masculinity that has impregnated all
this recounting.
Whenever I talked about flirty messages to pressure her into replying.

Before all that, the conversation was normal but a bit slower than before.

I'm now really considering removing her as a follower,
but it would just be another entry into the already long list about how
my maleness makes me be annoyed by her boundaries.

I guess the shame of seeing her actively living her daily life without any
interest in me in it is a price fair enough to pay for the crime of being this
pathetic.

It hurts the most that I came back to write this after finishing with the
750 words; after I had lifted my hands from the keyboard when I reached my goal.

Because I wanted to explain why;
even to myself, I want to go through the embarrassing list of every possible
reason that would make me think this could work.
And why is it, then?
I want to ask myself in curious wonder.
Because she's seeing the messages this time,
unlike that first silence in Whatsapp.
Which only argues that her active silence is better than her passive one.
It is better just because I am in her mind when she takes the choice of not
replying.
But it also loses all its value after stating how I am in her attention
(which counteracts the next —and only?— argument about seeing all of my stories)
exactly because of how disgusting and creepy I am being.

Now it feels even worse sharing my pre-transition picture online fishing for
a comment or reaction.
It was just the gift of having an image to attribute to the masculine energy
that stunk my interactions.

### Tuesday, February 8th, 2022
"Tienes un corazón enorme, no lo quieras esconder."

I haven't posted any Instagram story since the male picture of me
or the short-lived animal videos after.

Today Antonija posted a close-friends-restricted story with a drawing of a cat
reading a pussy cats magazine.
I reacted with a laughing emoticon.
She didn't reply anything.
That should be meaningless yet I think back to that picture.
Was she ignoring me now?

I felt dirty, repulsed.
As if I had just caught a sniff of my own pestilence.
She saw my own maleness and was disgusted, maybe she felt deceived.
She shared a room with me for two weeks.

I hope it wasn't that.

After I went to the kitchen to brew my coffee,
Alda proposed me to do again the collaborative working in the living room.

We got high way too early.
I haven't found the precise combination of weed and Adderall that would
give me the more productivity results.

I got Monica's email.
She described Karina, Flor and Alda's invitation to join them as me being
adopted into their little group.
For once, as I told her, I didn't feel envious of her—or anyone's,
really—closeness with other people compared to mine.
We spent together more than a hundred dollars in magazines.

She's rolling right now.
It's the middle of her shift.
She still has two more hours to go.

Was it really just yesterday when I replied to Kate's story?
It feels so long ago.
Is this part of the reason that I am so insisting and annoying,
that times feels different to me?
Am I going at a different speed than the rest of the world?

For a brief second, I imagined a scenario where she could reply back.
Would she have the personality to return the question and ask me if I'm the
one who went away?
Not really. Besides she wouldn't even notice my lack of posts.

I stood up to refill my glass of water before I physically did.
I saw my body still sitting with its hands over the keyboard and the black
serif-ed words on a bright screen.
I read the last paragraph and it was pathetic.
I can't wait until I pass this phase.

I am not even halfway done for today.
Vicky sent me a message on teams asking me about the account for Qrater.
I replied back and then nothing happened.
She did see it and answer, the interaction was normal.
Nothing special happened, I should had clarified.

Yesterday I was chatting with some girl from Tinder.
She's a pre-K educator.
I sent the last messages.
Has the conversation reached the end of its life?
I wanted to write how I didn't remember her name anymore.
_Sam_.

Will there come a point when I'll forget Flore's name?

I remember Stephany's.
I could recall Helena's last name a decade late,
as I wrote in the message that she possibly has already ignored.

Why do I remember these kind of facts?
Why wouldn't I want to?

When I started drinking, I actually drank with the purpose to forget.
In Spain, I wanted to mute the urges; the need to be a woman,
the emotions that overwhelmed me.
I kept them to a whisper for months.

What did I want to shut up when I drank before class?
What do I want to kill right now that I am thinking about how instead of water
I should have had some vodka.

I started a series the other day _The Flight Attendant_.
It made me uncomfortable the same way that _The Woman on the Train_ did.
Do I have an alcohol problem?
I thought about making a reference to my drugs use in my latest email but
I didn't dare to.

I still haven't written Alex's.

I talked with Sonny about telling her the rest of Monica's and Catherine's story.
I could write about it.
My 21st birthday... even before that.
Childhood stories as snipets.
I could tell all of my backstory as vignettes in network of notes.
As detailed and beautiful and painful as they can be.
The book, mémoire, or whatever it ends up being birthed can take form later.
Nobody has to read it.
It's my present to the world that was not asked nor wanted and will not be welcome.

I should have taken my old journals with me.

In a recent email, I was annoyed that I only seemed to write about failed
romances or being trans.
And here I am closing today with the fantasy of writing
_a fucking book_ about precisely that shit.

### Wednesday, February 9th, 2022
I'm writing this on my phone.
I considered texting Alda and telling her what just happened with the comment:
_it stopped being funny at all and it is just sad._

I feel like crying.
I didn't want to do it.
I didn't have anything to gain from it; I knew it and I still couldn't avoid it.
A strange pull moved me.
It's like if a writer had decided beforehand how the plot should develop
even if it goes against my internal motivations and inner desires.
It feels so unfair.
Why do I have to deal with this humiliation when it's caused by something
other than my own free will?

Why did I send another word?
This time I controlled myself after and didn't make it worse.
But lower than 0 is still nothing.

I'm in bed after returning from the living room with Alda.
I clicked on her profile and saw her stories.
They were her roommate's; two TikToks as parts of a whole.
They were together grabbing and holding two kinder chocolate boxes.
In his video, he was thankful for a sweet December with her.
She appeared several times pondering something and wearing different outfits
in front of the boxes.
I recognized them as being from different days.
I remembered her picture from Christmas wearing her red dress,
it was a story I replied to before she wished me a Merry Christmas.
Then, later, I saw her orange sweater over a rainbow shirt;
the same sweater she wears in the memories of our kiss.

It wasn't enough to recognize it.
I somehow got the foreign and irrational need to share it with her.
Like a teacher's pet looking up for recognition.
_Look what I accomplished, notice how important to me is your approval_.

I didn't even mention that—thank god.
Instead, I only complimented her stories as an introduction.
I sent yet another fucking message after she broke her silence to tell me
how too many messages made her anxious.
Over and over I keep breaking her boundaries and her explicit wish to be left
alone.

Now it's not just me pretending to be confused,
I'm literally refusing to see the clear request to stop.

I'm so fucking ashamed of myself.

"Fuck her for not replying.
Don't give [her] any more satisfaction [...]
Write you're welcome after." Alda suggested.

She saw it almost immediately.
I can't wonder what I was expecting,
because I am aware that I wasn't expecting anything at all.

I woke up filled with shame.

I grabbed my phone and saw a 14 over the HER logo.
I had a new match and several messages:

"Holly... hellooo cutie. Oh wow.
Hi cutie back.
My [god].
You have such beautiful hair.
My god, sorry so stunned lol."

"Hey, just woke up to this.
What a great way to start the day.
And exactly the time when my self-esteem needed it the most.
Thanks!" I replied to her.

"The good news is that sometimes I even let people touch it.
The bad news is that I just cut it recently.
I mean, I'm not bald now or anything, but it's way shorter."

She hasn't replied.
Maybe she won't.

I saw her pictures and looked for defects that would make me lose interest.
I saw her brown eyes, but that wasn't it.
Her hair was dyed, but it looked pretty.
In her third picture, I saw her body from behind and she wasn't thinner than me.
Was that what made it?
Am I this shallow?
Wasn't this what I wanted?
Someone to pay attention to me, send me many more messages than I do?

At 18h, Alda and I will go to Thomson House to study with her friends.
I feel the need now to tell her about me.
_I've been meaning to ask you, is it obvious that I am trans?_
Why now, is it after the vulnerability of sending yet another two other messages
to Kate after my moral hangover?
Does it have anything to do with the fact that I'll meet her two friends?

I went upstairs to see if the makeup I bought had arrived.
It was there.
I opened the package instead of starting working.
I could wear it.
Maybe I should.
Should I go now and put it on?
Maybe later, closer to when I plan to leave.
In the package, there was also a brush and an eyeliner.
I considered trying the eyeliner but I always mess it up.

I guess I can try it today.
Although I doubt that it'll make me feel any better.

### Thursday, February 10th, 2022
"Do you think I look pretty?... I don't know why I don't believe you."

What happened today?

I'm hight and drunk.
I finished a litter of white wine and even just told Sonny how I was
considering walking to the _déppaneur_ to get another one.

I went into the kitchen for a glass of water.
It's 22h.
It's early, I guess I could put on some pants and stay in the living room to
finish the book.

In the morning, what happened?
I touched myself and there was more than just spots.
My levels must be high.
I should mention something to Dr. Perera.

I lost another distraction to Instagram.
I haven't paid to _diggy_ lately, and by lately I mean today.

When did I send the last message to Kate?
It wasn't today.
It must not have been, or else I'm even worse than I could imagine.

What was it then that brought me to this spiral down-bottom?
I remember seeing the french magazine's like in my post when I was brewing my
coffee in the late morning.
I sent a message about it to Alda before I posted it as a story trying to fish
Kate's attention.

It feels weird typing down her name too many times,
as if somehow in the future she would be able to read these logs and look
for herself.

Alda didn't reply back before I posted that story.
The first time I browsed its viewers, Kate was there.
Less than 15 minutes after its publication.
I felt good about that, as if meant anything.
Then—did I forget about muting her own stories?
I must have sent that unreplied message yesterday then,
to have cause that mute—I looked at her profile and watched hers.
Even younger than 15 minutes,
I saw her post to her mass of followers about the medical needs for her PGWP,
and then a picture of her in a medical gown,
posing with her arm showing a taped cottonball where a needle had pierced it.

I don't know why my mind jumped to Alex praising my emails or today's story.
Why don't I care about their compliments?
Have I looked for reasons to invalidate their appraisal?

What was I even talking about?
Kate's stories.
Were those what brought me down?
No, of course not.
There was nothing special about those images or information that jumps up now
that I am describing them.
Maybe the information that she's applying for a PGWP even though she was
planning to go study something in Brussels, but that wasn't it.

Why am I this depressed? Is it her?

Is it Louis?
I had a meeting with him.
We talked about the comprehensive exam.
I feel pressured, but probably not the same meaning as the _pressured_ that Kate
wrote in her last message.

I have lots of stuff to do and they seem so far away and distanced and both
huge and harmless at the same time.
It's like I'm their prey and I know they would kill me in an instant were they
close, but there's some sort of barrier,
something between me and them that protects me.

I feel like a kid in a zoo admiring a tiger.

Kate's message is like a kaleidoscope.
Every time I read it again, I can turn its wheel and see it change form.
The most silly—and pathetic—thing is that she obviously didn't put that much
thought into it.
She put some thought, though.
I remember seeing the ellipses flashing after I sent the original text.
It was the turning point.
I could have left it then and there,
and I would be able to believe there was some sort of possibility that
everything would still be possible.
I am the one overthinking it.
Her message is like a puzzle being overanalyzed.
There's an obvious answer that I'm to committed to accept, and thus, see.

_She's not seeing much people._
I'm not her priority, never was but that's not really the point.
_Too many messages_, especially when they're fruitless, as she's stated
she's not dating right now, make her anxious and thus she responds less.
She felt pressured by my neediness, even though she clearly told me—several
times—beforehand that she was not looking for anything serious.
Even after all the evidence that she did absolutely nothing wrong
and didn't owe me anything, she still felt the grace to not only assume her
silence had caused me any ill, but fucking apologize in the case
that—because we both knew that of course it did—it did.

I have given myself this same explanation several times now.
What is the fucking thing that keeps me confused and intrigued?

### Friday, February 11th, 2022
"Hoy que venía caminando de la nieve pensaba como quiero estar desnuda con
alguien y caminar a la cama.
No preocuparme de si mi ropa interior me cubre lo suficiente o de si se me
nota el vello de la cara; solo caminar desnuda de regreso a la cama y
que alguien me espere con los brazos abiertos.
Quiero acostarme con ella y ver sus ojos iluminarse y sentirme tibia a su lado.
Que me sonría cuando me quite el cabello de la cara para besarme y
que cuando me mire y me diga lo bonita que me ve no sienta ninguna duda."

I don't feel like writing anything tonight.

### Tuesday, February 15th, 2022
"I was thinking just now about giving you my number;
you know, in case Tinder freaks out again.
But I didn't.
I thought it's too soon.
I had the feeling that letting you know I am interested,
even though I clearly am, puts me at a disadvantage.
It feels as if I were talking about a game, but, if it is,
I honestly think I don't know the rules.
It's probably just that I'm uncomfortable by showing vulnerability."

I don't remember the last time that I wrote in here.
I stopped for a while.
To Calli, in our session yesterday, I told that I've had stopped writing in here.
Two nights ago I couldn't sleep at all.

I feel like am in that loop again.
I don't think I've ever been this high.
Not even those times that come to mind where I doubted that I had been smoking
wrong all the past few years.
Not even Las Vegas.

Between the overconsciousness of my own movements, of my jaw and the
intermixing music and the lights in the room,
I had the thought that this weed might have had something else.

In session, I spoke about the two girls I had been talking with on Tinder
that suddenly disappeared from the app bringing down my mood one night
I was with Alda.
They made me delete all of the unreplied conversations leaving the app
empty again as when I reinstalled it.

Then, somewhen the next day or two, one of those reappeared out of nowhere.
But the negative thoughts and emotions I had stayed.

I consciously put the word thoughts in the last sentence so I wouldn't write
negative emotions.

Monica told me how I am the own who keeps bringing her up.
Today is the day that I will let her stories die.

But that is not true.
It was last night when I saw her last one at 1h.
It was a video of a manifestation—was it an embassy?—and some text.
I opened it as it was only a couple of minutes old.
But I stopped my finger and pushed it away, ignoring the following two.

Just an hour ago I had posted a tweet that wished a Happy Valentine's to all
the people who had jacked off to its author
and said they should all be buried together.

She saw it.
She saw the other two that I posted at noon today about trans healthcare.
Even though I posted the two within 5 minutes of each other,
she saw them hours apart.

In my mind, I projected unto her my familiar overthinking,
but, now that I write it,
I think about how she probably doesn't think of me at all.

Early in the morning,
I wrote in my phone what I would say if she ever wrote back to me.
It started as these three long messages explaining before finally asking her
what she wanted from me.
Then I removed the roundabouts and the unasked explanations and left just the
questions.
Then, suddenly I knew both the answers to those questions and that they
didn't serve any purpose.
Then the draft felt useless and just deleted it completely.

Earlier that night I told Alda—no.

After one of the disappearing women came back,
I sent her a message asking her to reassure me that we did have a conversation
before.
She was confused and asked me if I meant from back in person or
another time in that app.
I said that it was more practical than that;
I was referring to literally just a couple of days before.
She said _yes_ and then let me know how there was a message that she had been
banned, but later she could keep using the chat.

She asked me how I deal with negative feelings like insecurity.
I felt seen.
Not in a particularly good or bad way.
Like she saw through me; she could read me.

We talked, deeply.
She replied to my messages in a similar manner.
We continued in the middle of the night, liking each other's responses.

Was this before or after I finally could ignore Kate's stories?

A different girl, Katherine,
gave me her phone number and told me how she just finished a relationship of
three years and could use friends,
and mentioned going for coffee and babysitting my dog.
She was the one riding the Ikea cart.

Alda told me how she doesn't want to hook up with guys here when she was
talking about the date she's having soon.
She doesn't want to let them into her life.

Why am I the complete opposite by feeling my head and chest
with faceless girls?

### Wednesday, February 16th, 2022
"Can I add you on Snapchat?"

I sent Monica the e-mail that I left in drafts yesterday.
I got extremely high, like, as high as only a few other times.
My eyes were bloodshot, my senses intermingled and my thoughts shapeless.
It took me a while to get over it and come back to reality.

I finally let Kate's story(ies) die unseen.

I send another message to Maribel(?), and a text to Katherine.
Those went unreplied.

Katherine had given me her number to text her since she'd be deactivating her
account for a month.
It says the message was delivered, but unseen.
It's been one day.
Am I even that interested?

I opened Facebook dating again.
This time I had two matches in less than an hour.
I sent a message to one girl and she replied back in French.

Am I avoiding the subject?

I have two or three conversations with guys on Tinder.
Most of the likes I receive are from them—guys.
I swiped them right for a reason, but still I don't feel interested.

The French woman didn't reply back.
I could probably text her and she might.
Again, am I that interested?

I texted back the other woman that I had matched that time but disappeared.
Emily. I had asked her if scopa was fun and she never replied.

"That fun, huh! Does it have a strip version?" I continued without a care.

"If you play your cards right. Pun intended." She responded this time.

I saw she had added her Snapchat to her profile bio.
It wasn't there before, I think.
I considered adding her, but felt that it would be creepy and stalkerish.
Despite we had matched before and she added it publicly for people to add her
even before a match.

Even now as I'm typing this, in my head I am imagining,
just as I did when Kate told me in our date that she wasn't looking for anything exclusive,
how she talks to several people at the same time.
Me being just a dot in a scatterplot.

I told Alda how I had followed her teachings and they worked once again.

"What, being a fuckboi?"

She was not wrong.

I added her and shortly after she accepted the request.
I saw her public profile.
There was an horoscope sign and a flag with a red cross over white background.
I thought at first it was Nordic given her blue eyes and blond hair.
It turns out it's from England.

I saw her story where she's smoking something, tired from her shift.
Then it changed and she was under the covers, with her breasts barely covered.

It disappeared shortly after.
As I read online, you can see who watches your stories but not how many times.
Was it for someone and she deleted after noticing I had seen it?
No, I don't think so.

Was it specifically for me?

I didn't know if it was fine for me to send her a message or wait for her to reach me.

She did the latter.
She said we should play scopa with red wine.
I told her what I had rehearsed in my head, _with you, I'd play anything_.

We didn't talk much, before she offered to exchange pictures.
I starting flirting from the beginning,
asking her what she wanted to see from me.

She said how she loves the figure of breasts in women,
so she asked if she could see mine.

When I showed her,
she warned me that her snaps were more graphic and if I wouldn't mind.
My chest felt full and I thought I could see the redness of my own face.

She complimented my pijama shorts, _they looked like a schoolgirl's_.
I mentioned that I dressed as one for Halloween and she asked to see.
She commented how the picture was both cute and hot.
As surprising as it was, I believed her.

"You give off these good-girl nerdy vibes..."

I was too turned on to think that I hadn't told her that I am trans.
Everything caught me off guard.
After a video of her with a black bra in her shower asking me to join her,
I told her I was already soaking wet.

She sent me a quick text: _Prouve it_.

In that moment I was again dancing masked between the legs of a stranger woman
with feline eyes.

I took a video similar to the ones that I sent Sonny years ago,
reaching with my hand under my underwear.

After I climaxed, as if she had known,
she asked me if I had any plans this weekend.

"IDK, what do you want to do with me? ...or to me."

She didn't reply until the morning, apologizing for falling asleep.
She had posted another story in her job in a Hospital.

I held myself from continuing the conversation so I would not appear too over-eager.
Probably because of the pressure that I need to tell her about being trans
and the anxiety of the uncertainty of her response.

She asked me maybe an hour later how my day was going.
We exchanged two quick videos of each other,
her masked self sitting in a desk and me,
smiling in front of my laptop in the dinning room.

I wanted to send her another text in there telling her that I'm trans to get
over with this already. I came to write this instead.

### Tuesday, February 22nd, 2022
"Can I tell you a secret?
[...]
I've been on hormones for years and I didn't know I could still get this hard."

The internet went off for a while.
Just now did it come back.
Alda and I are sitting in the dinning room.
I have just finished sending off an email to Melissa.
Monica chewed me off, again, for bringing up the same subject.

"Sé que no y como amiga te digo que te escucho y lo llevo contigo y
lo sabes pero a veces te pasas de egoísta."

It was because I told her of the mental breakdown I had about the e-mail I
got from Aliza.

She asked me if it would matter if people knew about me or were talking about it.
What was it that I wanted—or not—to know?
What is it, indeed. Do I really want to?

Sonny wasn't as hard as Monica but her perception must be the same.

Yesterday she had an appointment with a sexologist.
Maybe I should start referring to them with different pronouns.

I did tell the _catfisher_ I was trans.
She said it didn't really matter.

Even after Alda's comment and my marijuana-triggered suspicions that
she wasn't real, I continued sending her sexual pictures.
I'm not sure if both her attraction and herself are real or not,
I think—as I told someone in an email or a message—that I don't even
care anymore.

I made a list of all the girls I've been talking with the intentions of dating.
Now, even more than last year, I've even lost count of them.
I was going to go for a platonic coffee with one of them this past weekend,
but the snow didn't agree with our plans.

The Turkish girl offered me to meet for coffee.
Now, after the thing with Aliza,
I'm even considering telling her I'm trans even before we agreed on the plans.

_Hey, I'm trans BTW.
I think it's harder to tell from the pictures and I get nervous enough already
in first dates to be worrying about this, too,
so I tell you now before we meet in case you mind._

"I find it so exciting.
You're the best of both worlds, love."

Do I believe her?
Do even want to believe it?
Maybe I lose attraction to people who are interested in me because
I see being interested in me itself as a sign of distrust.
I have the perfect excuse for that being trans.

Would I even prefer _Turkey_ to reject me beforehand?
If she does I have another reason to justify my misery and self-loathing.
If she doesn't, will that make me lose interest in meeting her?

Why am I writing now after these past few silent days?

Last night I was seeing videos with Alda, when I saw the snap from my catfisher.
She was showing me her chest biting the end of her shirt before suddenly
letting it fall by smiling.

I didn't want to close it.
I wasn't even looking at her breasts but her teeth.
She reminded me of a cat or a vampire.

I imagined how it would feel to bleed by her fangs.
Is she tearing me apart from the distance?

I kept sending videos as if somehow I could tame a tiger.

The same ones I would later send over to Sonny,
as if that would somehow justify their existence.

I wanted to hear they weren't phony or embarrassing.
Having someone that I know is real reacting positively to them made me worry
less about them being used for humiliating or laughing at me.

I wouldn't really mind them being posted on the internet if men used them to
jerk off.
I'd prefer that over them being as a fétiche of transhood.

Even then, I would prefer _that_ over mocking and humiliation.
I'd rather be the target of stranger's lust than their jokes.
If I am going to be dehumanized and seen as an object,
I rather be one of desire than disgust.

I am at that stage again when I open the different apps in a cycle looking
for a burst of dopamine and self-worth.
I added Bumble again to the bunch.

This morning, when I opened Her I saw the picture of Kate two times.
It's the first time that I see her online in there.
Is she dating again?
Did I think that somehow that would make more probable that she'd look me up?
No, I don't think so.

There's another red circle around her Instagram profile.
Maybe this one, too, will go off on its own.

### Thursday, February 24th, 2022
"Now you see what you cause me.
Let's play some strip scopa!
I'll bring the wine.
I'll even let you be the one to undress me."

"Well, you definitely are special.
Now good night, and for real;
I am currently busy imagining all the ways I'd like to punish you
if you really are that bratty irl."

"You like shisha? You like it?
Oh, my God, you're smoking, baby!"

I fell asleep around 3h and woke up before 8h.
Until moments ago I felt fine.
Not perfectly, but fine.

Everything is shitty, but it doesn't affect me personally.
Texas yesterday passed a bill that categorizes all forms of gender-affirming
care as child abuse.
There was a letter circulating that encouraged all Texans to report any cases
they might know of.
Russia attacked the border of Ukraine and there are threats of nuclear war.
I spent the night talking to Héloïse, a québécoise girl that looks identical
to how Monica used to look when we met.

I told Sonny that I started losing interest with my catfisher.

I mentioned something to my catfisher about meeting,
but she ignored that message.
This morning I sent her an even more explicit picture as a form of begging for
her attention.
She responded with an emoticon and I felt empty inside.

I sent that image with the secondary intention of ignoring the rest of
the images that she might send today.
It worked as well as my intention of ignoring Kate's stories.

Scrolling through the application,
there was a small banner with previews of the latest stories.
Hers was 3 hours old and yet was the first one on the left.
I saw it wasn't text but a video of her apartment.
That was the push I needed to open it.

Now that I've seen them, somehow everything is worse.
Only because I know I was already starting to feel a shitty mood,
otherwise I would have thought that they were the cause of my sudden irritability.

I hate how much I love her voice.

The first time that I heard Emily's voice I realized she might be real;
somehow hearing her speak—talk to me—brought her down to this material
world—into reality.
Before she was an idea; a possibility.
After hearing her, she was a potential person.

I still don't know what is the deal with her.
I probably will never meet her in person.
Is the boost in self-confidence about my attractiveness enough to keep this
game between us?

I feel like a teenager masturbating to a poster or an old porn VHS.
I am starting, again, to feel insecure about the number of people she's
playing with in the same way as me.

Probably this is all it is for her.
_Now I want to tease you during my work._
See how many people she can keep on the palm of her hand with her body as if
she were juggling balls in the air.
Is this is all I am now?
A flying ball being thrown over and over?

In the morning I considered sending her a picture of the outline of my dick.

Héloïse told me about the only time she's had sex with a transfemme person.
The dysphoria of her partner made the moment unbearable.
It almost put her off of doing it again with another one, she told me.
I don't know if she intended an emphasis on her _almost_ or I was the one
who projected it.
It made me feel as if it was there signaling hope for our possible encounter.

"Oddly enough, most AMAB people I connect with online,
the texting part goes well enough I might want to meet irl, are trans girls."

"[...] so I take I'm now part of that exclusive list of trans girls whose
texting has gone well enough that you might maybe actually want to meet irl?"

"Definitely."

Selin, the Turkish girl, replied to me saying how yesterday was rough with her
COVID, but she's feeling better now.

Elise, the ophtalmologist kept the conversation going, asking how my day was.
I considered asking her if she wanted to meet, but didn't.

Amanda—was it yesterday?—confirmed me that her phone number,
this time at least, was the correct one.
I replied to her text telling her how I am doing and returning the question,
instead of sending
_so what do you think about going on that cute date you mentioned in your profile?_

Salomé was the newest match I had on Tinder.
I asked her directly what was it that caught her interest from my profile
when she told me she was looking mostly for friends.

Maybe later tonight I'll send a text to Katherine asking about this weekend.

Am I doing the same thing as Emily?
Am I juggling these women in the air?
I'm distracting myself with the idea of them.
I just need one ball to slip through my fingers before all of them fall over me.

I muted Kate's stories again.

### Saturday, February 26th, 2022
"Well, I can say that from pictures it doesn't look.
Like, you said you're trans and I was like: _oh that's news to me_."

I'll meet with Katherine in a few hours.
I'm showered and have eaten a sandwich.
I'll take the metro to get to Verdun and meet her outside the bar at 19h.

Yesterday there was a mild snowstorm but today supposedly is not so cold.

I thought to myself that I wouldn't reach out to Emily anymore, but I did.
I kept the streak going sending her a picture of my open cardigan with nothing
underneath asking her if she liked it.

"I like what's under."

Not enough,
I also replied to her story of her wearing red lipstick and a matching
bright-red spaghetti-strapped dress.
She said nothing.
Now I won't.

There's this need of wanting to ask her about her looking out for me after that first time.
Hearing her reasoning, figuring out why.

Monica sent me an email yesterday where it was clear,
both in tone and explicitly, that she felt angered and annoyed with me.

I've told her myself,
she said, how I am too tired of talking about the same things over and over.
When it's not Kate is the Catfisher,
when it's not Alda not knowing about me is the dysphoria I feel with myself.

I talked again last night with Héloïse;
the girl that looks like a younger version of Monica.
Even her self-deprecating jokes about her looks sounded like her:
bigger boobs, counting her ribs just by looking, getting cut by her hip-bones.
Is that why I felt attracted to her in the first place?

In Snapchat, I posted a story trying to fish for Emily's attention.
When I glanced at the suggestions below,
I saw Héloïse's contact name with a paella dish.
I considered adding her as a friend in there.
Why?
Was I really expecting us to exchange pictures or was it another way to distract myself?

Instead, I took a screenshot and sent it to her.
This time she didn't wait until the night to reply.
She laughed at it.

Alda's not home, she must be at her sister's now.
Nico just head out to his cousin's for a party.
I'm sitting in my desk,
typing these words instead of finishing the work I was supposed to get done
these past few days.

Jess, one of the matches from Tinder asked me to add her on Facebook messenger.
Elise, the ophthalmologist, asked me out for coffee tomorrow.
Following the example of Héloïse's chat, I told them both I am trans.
From what I received as replies, none of them knew before.
Would they have figured it out when we met?
Does it matter, really?

The last e-mail that I sent to Monica is still unreplied.
I still haven't written back to Alex.
I responded to Aliza's, but she promised a second part shortly.

Katherine doesn't know.
I'll tell her, in person.
This is not a date, really, so there shouldn't be any problem.

Why didn't I with Kate?
She knew beforehand.
She asked me about my coming out, why didn't I take that chance?

Nobody has had any issues with it.
Héloïse told me how had she been the girl who asked me to join her to the restroom,
had I told her I was trans, she wouldn't have minded and would have just
told me to forget about a BJ and that if I wanted to put it in to
better to have a condom ready.

The last times that I've worn make-up my mascara ran because of the snow.
Maybe I should put it on now?
There's still more than two hours before our meeting time.

What else could I write in here?

Héloïse told me that her jamming session in her house would be later tonight.
After I told her that I was procrastinating after deciding I should work,
she said that so was she.

She wished me luck in Japanese.
I asked her about what, whether it was about work.
She said yes.
I ended the conversation with
_will you imagine again ways to punish me if I don't?_

I won't reply if she does, not now.
I won't add her either.
That was flirty and explicitly sexual.
It doesn't come out of the blue since last night, and that other time as well,
we talked about BDSM and her—and a little of mine, too—kinks.

It's 17h. I should leave 30 minutes before 19h; I have time to do some work.

## March, 2022

### Thursday, March 3rd, 2022
"Do you want to kiss me before I leave?"

I guess I am bipolar.

Yesterday I took the first dose of the antipsychotic medication.

This morning I kept chatting with some of the guys with whom I matched last
night on Tinder.
I wasn't even planning on meeting them.
The first one asked me to meet him tonight.
I told him then by asking him if he knew what the flags in my profile mean.
Yes, that you are queer.
I told him explicitly, then, that it means I am trans.

"Trans from where?"

When I clarified that I was born a baby, then a boy, and now a woman,
he unmatched.

The second one wasn't as sexually direct.
I replied to him in French the whole conversation.
He asked me to go for coffee sometime and thus I told him that my french
wasn't as good and that I was trans.

_This is the time where you disappear_, I said in French.

I kept looking at his conversation every once in a while to check if he was
still there.
The last time I checked, he wasn't.

Jess picked me up close to 10h.
I recognized the familiar dying of interest when she kept messaging me often.
If someone shows interest in me, automatically my subconscious looks what is
it that is wrong with them.

I saw her in the car and heard her voice and was surprised by how much I liked her.
Same thing happened with Kate,
which was the same thing that happened with Flore.

I sent an image of a meme to Héloïse of a conversation between a girl and a
man having sex.
The girl asks him to hurt her and he replies telling her
her obsession with books doesn't make her quirky nor intelligent,
but it's only escapism from her life.
Her look towards character development and relationships in the stories are
because of her inability to cultivate her own.
I asked her if those were the kind of punishments she imagined those times.
She said no.

"I just like to bruise their bodies, not their souls."

"One of the times that I considered looking into bdsm", I later wrote to her,
"I was actually curious in the degrading stuff.
Obviously pretend, and just in the sex act, not the 24/7 kind of thing.
Now that I think of it,
maybe it's the idea of having someone talk to me the way I talk to myself,
just so I don't have to."

The message is still, to this point, unseen.

Amanda, the girl that suddenly disappeared that other time,
hasn't replied to my texts trying to find a time for our date.
After her silence, I sent her one a couple of days ago,
asking her if she would be interesting in going on a cute date like the one
she talked about in her profile.
The word date was not in my message but she implied it in her relatively
quick response.
I made no mention of the fact that I had seen she changed her biography,
which now shared how she's very horny,
or that she's more than 600 kilometers away.

Everyone seems to be far these days.
Héloïse lives close to Quebec city.
Salomé is away on a trip with her parents.
Elise went to work in the same city upnorth where that girl from Facebook lives.
Selin was on a trip to New York with her friend.

I posted a story on Instagram talking about the high price of my mood stabilizers
and how maybe sending nudes to strangers or stalking French girls isn't so bad.

Kate saw it.
Alda commented that now is a sure thing that she won't respond to the
fuckboy message that I was supposed to send next week.
I don't think I wanted to anymore.
Now I'm really considering just unfollowing her, if not outright block her.

I went to Ginksgo with Jess.
We had breakfast and chatted.
She asked me about the meeting with my psychiatrist and talked about her
sisters and college life.
When she brought me back home she showed me her puzzles.
When I asked her about kissing me,
I noticed how she blushed exactly at the same time that I realized she was
saying no.
_She's not comfortable with touching that quickly._

I couldn't hide my discomfort when I told her I understood
before getting out of the car.
We texted a little bit.
She was worried that she had offended me.
I mentioned again her plans of meeting again shortly before she
leaves for her birthday trip.
She said she would tell me, surely.
And then the conversation ended.

Yesterday I got a Snap from the threesome girl.
A couple of days ago, after she replied to my story,
I sent her one of the saved ones I had sent to my catfisher and telling her
that I owed it to her.
She encouraged me to continue in a similar way to Emily's.
I did.
I brought up the fact that I was trans,
and she, too, reassured me that she didn't mind.

"You're so freaking hot."

This time yesterday,
when I replied to hers with another one coming right out of the shower,
she didn't open it.

She still hasn't. I don't know if she won't, like Emily.

### Sunday, March 6th, 2022
"BTW, when you got locked out from your other account
how did you find me? Why did you look for me in the first place?"

I lost count of the number of people that I was making plans of seeing.
There is one guy in Tinder who asked me out a couple of days ago and I
considered rescheduling instead of saying no altogether.
Was that how Kate felt about me?

I still feel irritated with myself every time that I type her name or
mention her whatsoever.
For a while I successfully kept her stories muted and ignored.

I saw the red circle around her BLM profile picture and clicked it even
though I knew I would regret it.
Regret it I did.

A couple of months ago,
I remembered seeing a story of hers with a Mexican woman.
I recall pretty well how it sent me through some jealous thoughts even though
they absolutely weren't warranted.
Today, I was playing with the dating apps after I felt insecure with last
night's house party in the apartment and Nico's only girl friend present.
I opened her profile and saw she was 11 kilometers away from me.
I kept that thought when I clicked on the eclipsed sun in her Instagram.
It was a video of water with some background music and the tag of her friend
above.

Or girlfriend? Does it matter?

I went to her profile and saw the pinned stories.
There were several from a couple of weeks ago in their place.
And some from last week in Place des Arts.
Around the same time I went with Kath ice skating.
They did go up the Ferris wheel that I saw with Alda when we walked Brioche there.
I was craving the same Poutine that I finally tried and ate with her at her
sister's place.

Emily—the non-catfish and single mother—finally saw the messages I sent that
she was ignoring.
I muted her stories, too.
She saw my messages little after that.
She posted some today with a thong and then a very short one smoking a
joint with the caption _Yes. I am real._

I sent her a cheeky message asking her, if she were indeed real, for the
reason why it said Capricorn when she was clearly an Aries.
I didn't care that she'd know that I stalked her.
I honestly believed she was catfishing me.
I could explain it to her as the funny story it is,
if she desired any kind of connection beyond interchanging purely physical
pictures craving attention and the feeling of being desired.

Surprisingly, she did answer.
She let the birthday as January 1st in there.
I took the opportunity to present to her the questions that had been in my
mind—other than _you're not catfishing me, right?_ —all this time.

She saw them but said nothing.
Not right then.
Now there is a small blue icon telling me that there's an answer waiting for me.
Do I really want it?
I won't believe it anyway if there's anything other than dismissal.

Neither Héloïse nor Jess have seen the messages I sent a couple of days ago.
Did I do something wrong?

Amanda, after agreeing to the possibility of going on a date also hasn't replied back.
Kath, on her part, did answer after a while,
telling me she had a hard week as she broke up with her partner again.
Instead of seeing it as a possibility of something—anything—happening between us,
I sincerely felt bad for her.

I don't think she's attracted to me. Why would anyone be?

_You're so freaking hot._

There were more than a hundred men liking my profile,
even with the trans flag in the bio.
Although not many straight men know the meaning behind it.

I swiped right a bunch of them and replied to a few, including a couple that,
after telling them that most men feel uncomfortable with me being trans,
reassured me that both were quite into it.
I asked them if they speak English with the full intention of considering
meeting them but neither of them replied back.

I am filling some void with these conversations.
I am looking for something there,
even though I am sure I won't find anything and end up hurting myself.

Why do I keep looking—stories, profiles, apps—,
sending messages and asking questions?

Let's help each other feel a little less alone.

"Hey lonely."

"Hey. Oh don't tell me you're not even a little bit lonely.
Everyone feels alone these days."

### Friday, March 11th, 2022
"I want to make out with you; I hope you will invite me to your place."

...

"You know, this is the first time I have sex with someone without knowing their last name."

***

It happened, I guess. Finally.

I had sex.

I met Amanda at the italian _caffetiera_ close to home.
I was pretty punctual, entering the place at exactly 14h30.

I saw her sitting at the booth before I realized she had texted me she was there.

I ordered a latte before joining her.
We chatted for a bit and filled the silences by drinking water.
The conversation was nice—which wasn't really surprising since I liked her from
that first night that we had those deep questions in Tinder.

The weather was nicer than usual.
That's the reason she asked me to meet half an hour after the arranged time.

When we got tired of drinking water after finishing our coffees,
we decided to walk outside.
Unintentionally, the route we took brought us back to the dog park at Dr Penfield.

When we returned back downtown,
after passing the window of a sushi place and talking about our trips and
favourite foods,
she asked me nonchalantly if I had any other plans later that day.

None of the girls from Hinge—_Turkey_, _EyeDr_, _JewishGirl_—had replied back to
my messages.
Other than _the writer_ that I'd meet on Saturday morning,
I didn't have any plans at all.

We went to get some food.
I had just mentioned I've been enjoying Asian food so she proposed getting
some sushi.
There was a good-rated place close-by.

When we got there they asked us if we had a reservation—even though it was
completely empty—and the ambience was the one of a very fancy place.

"What is your money situation like?" She asked me.

We—I?—could afford the food.

We continued the talk about ethical non-monogamy and dating in general.
We pondered out loud, together, how would a three-way date would work.

I told her the stories about how I asked Jess if she wanted to kiss me and
she said no and that other time I didn't get the code of going together to the
restroom.

She told me to my face that she thought I was pretty.
When I asked her to say more about it, she mentioned the way I was holding
my hand to my face and the small triangle formed above my eye with my lose
lock of hair.

I responded with how I was deeply focused in her eyes.
They were green and looked as if they'd taste like herbal tea.

She told me to my face that she was attracted to me.
Actually, how I reached out to her multiple times was one of the reasons she was.
Calli had asked me a couple of sessions before,
if I had ever realized there might be someone out there who,
instead of thinking I am needy or dependant,
would read my insistence as interest and care.

We came back and came to my room.
I hung my blue cloth mask at the door handle as an inside joke to myself.

The next morning, Alda texted me asking me how it had gone and added a picture
of the door.
I guess I told both her and Armando about that.

We had sex.
I ate her out and she did me, too.
I am not sure if I made her cum, but she definitely enjoyed it.

She kept grabbing my hands and moaning as I was caressing her hipbones
while I was stroking her clit with my tongue.
There was so much wetness that I could swallow her taste.

She let me know that she was over-stimulated and would want me to either
penetrate her or go down on me.

With one of my exes, two fingers was too much.
With another, after the second finger, we'd move on to using a vibrator.
Once, I asked one of them to use two with me.
This is the first time that I used three fingers on someone else.
I didn't think of offering her using one of my toys.

She took off my underwear without flinching.
She tried to lower the skin from the tip of my genitals and I didn't realize
she had already done it before I tried to warn her
it wouldn't go down all the way.

I don't think she noticed how scared I got when I found it hard to get it
back up.

I read somewhen somewhere how, with this condition,
sometimes lowering the foreskin carelessly can lead to inflammation and
lose of circulation.
I would not want to have to go to the ER with an inflammed glans as a woman.

I didn't come, but she did get me hard.

I offered trying to put it in after remembering the chat with Héloïse—who
hasn't replied nor seen my last messages.

She hesitantly brought up if I had a condom.
Maybe my secure and quick answer reassured her.

We couldn't put it in, though. So it didn't happen.

My favourite part of the night, even more than the sex,
was the two of us just lying naked on the bed holding each other and,
every once in a while, kissing softly on each other's heads.

I didn't know if it was expected or over the top,
but I told her that she was welcome to spend the night if she wanted to.

She didn't.

"I think I'll leave before I fall asleep",
she said around half an hour after my proposal.

When I walked her to the door of my apartment,
I asked her to text me that she had arrived safe.

"I'm sorry.
I'm really bad at doing that, so don't think I died."

I didn't press the issue.

During one of our earlier conversations,
she mentioned me that she's really bad at texting and takes a lot of time to reply.
As I told her when we brought back the subject in our second date of the day,
that reassured me that it wasn't because of me.

Last night I went to Thomson House with the guys from the lab.
As I walked towards the building,
I saw a blonde girl with a beanie walking uphill with a plastic bag.
I discarded the idea that it could be Vicky,
just to realize later that she actually was.

### Sunday, March 13th, 2022
"I wanna see you completely naked.
Can I?
[...]
You could be my extra naughty girl and slip away from the dance floor.
Secretly snap me that sexy body."

"Why do you have this power over me?
[...]
I honestly thought you were a catfish after that first night before you
said your account got locked.
I still kept messaging you, tho."

I had so much to write that I even considered writing in my phone's notes
application like I used to do some years ago.

Alda sent me some texts asking me to order an Uber for her.
At the bar, I had to transfer her some money so she could buy a round of shots
since they weren't accepting tap and I didn't bring my credit card with me.

The Ubers kept cancelling on her and she walk halfway to her building in McGill.
I offered to bring her the coat that she had asked me hours before to take with
me when I accompanied Nico home.
I met her there at around 4h, after the time change.

I mentioned to her this morning how I had sent nudes to my catfish again
because of insecurity feelings that had awaken in my at the bar.
I didn't tell her that the reason of that insecurity was related to my offhand
comment I made the night before to her that Gabriela was hitting on her.
When I brought that up, she smiled and told me how she had noticed.

"But, I mean, she's 20 years old", she had said.

I noticed it when she started asking for Alda and where she had gone,
or how she took her by the hand inviting her to have some shots and drinks.
I saw them walk away and felt a dangerous mixture of being invisible,
left-out, and jealous.

I went to the restroom and hid in a stall from my own thoughts.
I had a message from Emily.
I obliged and sent her several pictures before showing her my half-erect penis.

It didn't make me feel better about myself,
but it masked the feelings I had for the rest of the night.

Karina is here.
She came to work/study with us.

Last night I kept talking with one girl from Hinge.
I had sent her a comment to her picture with the prompt _caption this picture_.

"Rehearsal dinner of your soon-to-wed evil-twin" was my guess.

She got back to me around a week—or more?—after.
We kept chatting intermittently for a while.

Last night, in one glance at her profile,
I realized her hometown was stated as South West France.

"Oh wait, are you French?",
I asked her right after a large message with several questions before she
could answer them.

"Yes I am", was her only reply.
At that very moment,
I suspected that would be the last message that I'd get from her.
I didn't know what else I could say other than _Cool_.

Surprisingly, she did get back to me.

Now I also kissed Alda.

Kind of.
The two of us were dancing around Gabriela when Nico look straight at her
and signaled a four with his hand.
I did not see her reaction, but he grabbed me and Alda by the arms.
That was the moment when I realized what he meant.
How ironically that his intention was to kiss three women at the same time,
and yet that action is the gayest thing that I can think of.

Alda moved away at first, but it didn't take much of him to convince her.
I don't think I even felt any of their lips.
I wanted to kiss Gabriela so much
that I couldn't help feeling guilty about my own desire.

_Acéptalo, tío. Eres feo._

I saw Gabriel pulling her arm when she started dancing with some unnamed
guy at the bar.
She kept grabbing both me and Alda,
and I enjoyed feeling her hand and the warmth of the skin of her waist.
I realized that I wasn't much different than those strange men,
taking advantage of a much younger and drunker girl.

I don't know why I had the idea that she was older.
Lizzie and Karina, when invited to guess her age,
both said how she looked so young.

Their right guess of 20 years old brought a sting of discomfort within me.

I don't have the excuse of feeling horny since I am on these new medications
and I had sex recently.
Maybe it's just the shitty parts I have in me.

Beside talking to this new french girl, I also kept talking with Héloïse.
She's fairly close to Montreal now,
yet I don't think I will be meeting her soon.

I unfollowed Kate from Instagram.

### Tuesday, March 15th, 2022
Tomorrow I have the meeting with the psychiatrist.
I didn't do much of the homework he left for me.
I downloaded the books and look through the list he sent me.
He didn't send back the form for the OSD.
I guess I can ask him.

How have I've been feeling with the new medication?

### Friday, March 18th, 2022
_Wanna come over? I can cook for you._

"IDK how is it for you, but it does get old pretty fast to have empty
conversations in here that most of the time don't really get to anywhere.
Are you free this weekend?
Do you want to get coffee and at least put a face to the person we're gonna
potentially end up ghosting anyway? I'll pay."

I was coming home from the date with the latest French girl, when,
halfway here, I decided to get to the _dépanneur_ and buy some beer and chips.

This is the first time that I payed for my other date.
That's not true.
I payed for Kate's coffee when we went to that last date—she had payed for my
Indian dish at the previous one.
I think I passed that place on my way home.
There was a guy sitting in a table inside the empty restaurant.
I saw him through the window pane and, moments later,
connected the dots in my head.
I actually took a couple of steps back to see the place again.

It all started months ago when I commented on some girl's Hinge profile trying
to guess the backstory of her picture.
Today I got the real story behind it.
I didn't even remember it was hers when she told me.

Like Kate's, I really have no clue about how the date went.

Not really. With Flore, I knew how I felt but, apparently, didn't how she did.
With Kate, on the other hand, I was not sure how either of us had felt towards
each other.
Still to this moment, her feelings and thoughts towards me—more then than now,
at least—are a complete mystery to me. With Chloé now, on the other hand,
as soon as I saw her I realized I was not attracted to her.
I have no idea how she feels towards me nor do I care.

There is something in me that gets invested in the other person as soon as I
sit in front of them.
It's happened every time.
First with _M_, Minas, when I even considered asking her to come over,
and then with every other girl since.
I kept messaging both Nicola and Michelle,
even though I am pretty sure I don't feel attracted to either of them.
It's just, other than Kate, I haven't met anyone twice.

Jess hasn't seen the messages I sent her in messenger.
She was saying how she was going to go on some chalet.
Did I tell her the story about me being ghosted every time with a similar story?

After a couple of minutes chatting,
even though I was completely worried about how the conversation would die,
I noticed how I kept looking straight at her and my subconscious was
inconspicuously convincing myself that I wanted to be there,
for there to be something next,
and that _something next_ to happen with her specifically.

The conversation somehow flowed fine.
She asked me for the time and two and a half hours had passed already.
The same thing happened with Marie-Line.
I didn't hear from her after putting to practice Kate's phrase of let me know
if you wanna do this again.
I probably won't hear from her either.
She didn't lie to me, at least.
Had she asked that question, would I text her?

Am I using this journal just to talk about the girls I see and,
once every other year, have sex with?

Alda and I worked on our Bumble bff profiles.
We talked about meeting people and maybe inviting someone to come over and
play some games.
I had a couple of matches but didn't really feel motivated to reply back.
In a text, I told her how since there's no possibility of having sex,
what's the point really?

I did, anyway.
Reply, that is.
I had a couple of matches on Tinder as well.
On my walk home I sent two messages.
One in English and another in broken French.
I hope the last one knows English.
She wouldn't be the first one to stop replying after I ask
_est-ce que tu parles anglais?_

The Soundbar arrived today but I had no time to install it before leaving.
This time I wasn't late, but Chloé got there before me.
She lives a couple of blocks over.
I had no idea.

Coming over, I thought how whenever Alda asks me how the date went,
I can tell her that after not feeling it with this girl
I at least could put an end to the joke of my fixation with French women.

I, instead, typed the message that I was convinced I didn't want to send to
Kate.

### Friday, March 25th, 2022
"You look very pretty with your hair up
[...]
can I kiss you?"

The better I feel, the less I write.
Yesterday I told Michelle—no, it was two days ago; or was it yesterday?—just
how I had told Alexandra,
that I've been exchanging long and personal e-mails with my friends.

Except that I haven't, not lately.
It's been weeks since I sent the last one to Monica.

Looking up in here,
I see more empty white boxes marking missed days than the green checkmarks.

I went out last night with Michelle after my meeting with Louis.
I met this week, as well—Monday if I remember correctly—with my committee.
They like my project and gave me some good feedback and suggestions.

Louis promoted my software and told me half-jokingly that I
wasn't good selling it myself.
Was it humility or insecurity?

Wednesday I met with Alex.
I finally went to Café Chat L'hereux.
It was nothing special.
Neither of us had gone before.
I told her I had wanted to visit it and almost went there once,
but there was a long line outside and it was raining.

I made no mention of with whom I was pretending to go.

Alex, Michelle, Kate, all of them study at Concordia.
I removed Kate as a follower so she doesn't see my stories nor pictures anymore.
Do I regret it?
No, it's better to don't fool myself into false hope that one day somewhen
out of the blue I'll receive a message or something from her.

Talking about messages out of the blue,
I woke up to a message from Héloïse in Whatsapp.

Just yesterday I was thinking about messaging her or what she was up to as I
walked back from the metro station.
I decided against it.
What could I say?
I want to see her and meet her, but when she was here herself,
she told me how she was so busy with schoolwork and personal errands that
meeting with me would be impossible.
The idea that was barely forming in my head about telling her
that I have now a communauto account and thus the possibility of renting a car
and driving to Quebec City didn't materialize.
I didn't get to the point of wondering how I could ask her if she was free a
weekend anytime soon.

And I just did.

"Y qué estabas pensando?"

I should shower, probably.
Today I don't have a date, but I'll meet with the OSD advisor.
When I talked with Calli about it she told me how I was partly correct.
Most of the students that get services and facilitations from OSD are
undergrads, as the relationship with our PIs is the most important one with us
graduate students.

I guess it was a good idea to tell Louis about my recent diagnosis
and mental health.

I'll meet with Catherine tomorrow.
Not that Catherine.
This one is a physicist living half-an-hour away from here.
We agreed to meet in Place-des-arts to go to Lola Rosa.
She's vegetarian, so I suggested that place as it's vegan.
I loved the nachos when I went there with Kory.

I sent a message to Anahí telling her how I am the most excited about that
one—there's an irrational worry just now back in the corner of my
subconscious that, just because of this, it won't get to happen—,
but I don't know how to feel with the idea that she's named as my ex.

After the Café, Alex asked me if I was planning to get back to work or if I
were free for the rest of the day.
When I told her that I, indeed, was free all day.
She suggested we go grab a drink.
The cats were cute, but there were several times when we felt the whole place
going quiet and our words bouncing back from the walls.

Did I pay for both drinks?
Probably I did.
She asked for the Uber that took us to Crescent.

Crescent is the street where Hurley's is—the bar where Vix's friend works.
Alda and I have gone there a couple of times.
Alex and I entered to Brutopia, a few places down the street.

I met her at the café at 15h and we walked towards Concordia campus at 21h.
She was going to take the shuttle to Loyola campus.
At one point in our way she intended to separate but ended up walking with me.
She mentioned my skirt, how I looked cute, but still I must have been cold.
She was.
She invited me to come inside the campus while she waited for the bus
but it was already outside.
We walked right back after entering to where we'd say our good-byes.
Both of us had our masks on still when she asked if she could kiss me.

I put my hand behind her neck instead of on her cheek.
I played with two locks of her curls and it was as if I could feel the blond
color in my fingertips.

She asked me to text her that I had arrived well.

I did.

### Sunday, March 27th, 2022
"You know, I wanted to kiss you, but the last time I thought
_I'll just ask; the worse she can say is no_, she did just that.
Haven't gotten over it, honestly.
Hope you didn't want to and nothing was lost."

Catherine was an hour late.

I see the vast majority of white boxes compared to green ones and I can't
help but think that I might just come writing here when I have a date or am
over-thinking about a woman.

I was expecting Alda's question about how it had gone.

How did it go?

I wore my heeled boots and a black skirt.
Alda saw me leave and complimented it.
It was 5°C outside but the tights kept me warm enough.
In my head I rehearsed what I could answer if she were to ask me why I had worn
a skirt or if I were cold.
_I couldn't put on make-up nor shave because of my appointment with the skin doctor,
the least I could do was try to wear a cute outfit for you._

She texted me to say that she was on her way and would arrive around 15h15.
I mentioned how I had my camera to keep me busy.
Keeping busy I tried for the 30 minutes before her ETA.

I payed a big portion of the Laser treatment.
I told Alda later that night the story of how I was so high that I was going
to tip 150 CAD to the doctor.
Fortunately she corrected me and put it towards my balance.

She eventually sent me a text telling me that she had found a parking and,
if it wasn't reserved, she'd join me promptly.
Time started passing and I started feeling colder.
I went inside and asked for a table for two.
They asked me if I had a reservation and I felt guilty for my lack of thinking.
That happened the other time with Michelle, during our first meeting.
They did sit me and I ordered a latte.

I was considering texting her and ask her if everything was alright.
I had written down the question when I received her text saying that the
previous spot was, indeed, reserved, but she had gotten another one and was
finally on her way.
I finished my coffee.

After she waved to me from the entrance, when she sat down in front of me and
took off her mask, I saw the figure of her mouth after her smile had
dissipated.
I was barely conscious of how my head was busy looking for flaws or
manners that I would find unattractive.

She had a marked french accent in her speak, but I found it intoxicating.
It wasn't as strong as Flore's, but still more present than Kate's.
At that moment, after the subconscious comparison,
I started fearing that she—but more importantly I—would follow that same fate
of ghosting or fixation followed by the eventual emotional mourning.

She talked most of the date, but didn't seem to mind it.
I certainly didn't.
It was refreshing not to have to worry about silences.
I hadn't eaten all day and we kept postponing ordering food because she was
too distracted telling me about quantum physics and qubits in quantum computing
to take a look at the menu.

After eating, I glanced at the drinks menu and asked her if she wanted to
order something else.

She said no and instead we asked for the bill.

I worried that it would be the end of our meeting and we had not touched the
subject about our expectations of the date.
So I brought up the subject when we started walking outside.
I prefaced my question stating that because she was going to leave the country
in a couple of months so I assumed she wasn't looking for something long-termed.

She corrected me to say that, even though she was indeed close to leaving,
it didn't change what she was looking for.
She doesn't have strict expectations,
but she's not the type of person for going for one night stands.

Her words reminded me of Amanda and our three-dates-in-a-day.
Would that count as a ONS?

It all depends if I see her again or not, I guess.

That thought made me confuse the ideas of ONS and sex on the first date,
and thus, felt a little disappointed with her statement.

We kept walking.
When we passed a park, I asked her if she was going towards her car already.
After she answered no, I proposed to change direction and redirect towards the park.
We continued walking and chatting until the sun set and it was completely dark outside.
We talked about hiking and trekking, videogames, and movies.

I asked her if she had fulfilled her expectations for the date.
When we eventually found her car, after twice she asked me if I was sure I
wanted to continue following her—was she subtly hinting me towards leaving?
I actually asked her but she didn't admit it.

"Can I give you a hug?," I asked her before leaving her.

She hesitated at first and mentioned something about me being willing due
COVID before opening me her arms.

I texted Alexandra on my way home.

This morning, I texted Amanda and Kath.

I have the phone facing down as a way to convince myself that I don't really
care about getting responses from any of them.

### Monday, March 28th, 2022
"I'm so sorry for taking so long to reply...
I'm free this week (in the evenings) if you still want to meet."

"[...] Hey, sorry I didn't respond earlier.
I had a lot of fun this weekend, you are an incredibly wonderful person,
however I don't think a romantic relationship will work between us.
I want to wish you all the best in that respect."

I received today an automatic e-mail that made everything worse.

Melissa's e-mail yesterday talked about her patient's mother death and how
with her parting, all of her love went away.

_My mother is dead, and everything is worse now._

I feel like crying right now.
It's not the e-mail about the candidacy exam, but about not being ghosted.

How silly that had I been ghosted as I thought I was,
I would not be feeling this way.

Yesterday, I texted Alexandra and we agreed to meet this coming Friday.
She'll come here and we're going to watch _The worst person in the world_.
I offered her the option of seeing it in the theater or here,
she chose the latter as she liked the idea of it being cozy.

"Nico won't be here", Alda assured me, after I told her,
that she could get lost and go to her sister's.

I know I shouldn't expect it,
but it's pretty obvious that we'll probably end up having sex.
She knows I am trans.
She knows that I'm not looking for anything serious nor exclusive.

Salomé, the other girl who I was completely sure I wasn't going to hear from again,
sent me a message.
It's been two weeks.
She offered to meet this week.
I was just telling Alda how I need to dial it down with the dates and expenses.
I still said _yes_.

I have two dates this week.
If any one of those two— or even any of the others that I've been on—were
the ones that had rejected me instead,
I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have stung this hard.

When the first québécoise girl sent me that message as I was eating something
with the guy from Querętaro didn't feel like this.
It stung, of course, but I don't remember feeling like crying.

It's the opposite of being ghosted.
She apologized for the silence and was open about not being attracted to me.
Complimented me as a person—albeit a little patronizingly to my taste—and even
accepted continuing talking.

Why do I feel this shitty?

"Te gusta que te digan que no." Said Anahí, when I talked to her.

"No, o sea, sí, pero la verdad esta vez sí me caló.
En serio, sí ando un poco adolorida.
Incluso en mi putería y en mi etapa _sexual freedom, 0 attachments_ creo que sí
te dije que esa cita era la que más me emocionaba.
Hasta mi roomie se fue a su cuarto porque vio como me cambió la cara cuando
le estaba contando de la francesa que me _de-ghosteó_ y le pedí me esperara y
empecé a sonreír cuando vi la notificación con su nombre
antes de leer la segunda mitad de su mensaje donde me rechaza y se me borrara
la sonrisa.

"O sea, fue una cita;
soy totalmente consciente que ni siquera me gustó ella como persona
porque no la conozco.
Pero aún así, no lo sé; estoy sensible.

"No es la primera vez que me rechazan ni será la última,
pero esta vez es poco diferente.
Y sentí raro, porque es la primera vez que lloro después de los nuevos
medicamentos y es como, no es por hormonas, ni depre, ni el vacío existencial
de siempre; es pura tristeza.
_This is new to me._"

"Don't see this as rejection, it's just in person it's not a romantic match."
Her message continued.
"Never worry about yourself though.
You don't need to change yourself for others,
you just need to find someone the loves you as the great person you are.
It's just, you know, we can fake love.
You're perfect just as you are, even without makeup or shaving."

I got an email from IPN today about how the first attempt of the candidacy
exam has to be before April 30th.
If after that date I haven't had it, it will be marked as a Fail.

I drafted a new doodle poll within the last week of April and sent a couple of
emails to Louis.
I drafted another email to Boris asking for a meeting next week in order to
talk about OSD.

I'll meet Salomé this Wednesday for a drink in Vieux Port.

### Tuesday, March 29th, 2022
"[...]
I've really enjoyed talking to and hanging out with you
but I don't think this is really going anywhere for me
[...]"

"Don't remember if I told you.
I had this idea of a date of walking up MtRoyal to see the sunset atop and
wandering there at night.
With spring coming, would you like to do it w/me one of these days?"

"That sounds nice, I would like to do that with you."

I've been feeling sad again.
After last night, I felt like crying today again,
but this time it wasn't because of a woman.
I sent the email to the committee and to Boris.
Some filled the new Doodle poll.
Only Danilo and Boris are missing.
There is just one option from the ones that I gave that works for the three
people that have answered.
I am starting to feel anxious and frustrated.

Louis offered to meet tomorrow.
He gave me the option to talk to him today,
but I was already waiting for Dr Perera's appointment.

Before that, I went to the pool and swam for a while before going into the sauna.
My stomach feels weird.
It's the fourth or fifth time that I've gone to the restroom feeling gassy
but can't relieve myself.

Pool, Dr. Perera, Photography club and Laser hair removal.

I'll meet with Louis tomorrow morning.
10 hours exactly from this moment.
I went to get some cash for the Sugar Shack later this week.

Catherine was the girl who told me she was going to go to one.
It feels weird typing her name.
I replied to her text in the very early morning and she hasn't replied.
Probably she won't.

I, honestly, maybe, really hope she won't.

From the bank I walked to McGill and went to the photograph club office.
The door was closed.
I asked the guy sitting in the table next to it if he knew if there was
anybody inside.
I sat and read the paper Louis had sent this morning to pass the time
before my appointment.

At the laser hair removal session I was treated nicely.
When I paid the rest of the balance they charged me without taking into
account the 150 dollars I gave as a tip last week.
I did notice but didn't have the courage to say anything.

As if that wasn't enough,
I turned the contract they gave me and it stated in caps MAN,
before the number of sessions.
I threw it away when I got home.
Reading it hurt even more than the burning pulses under my skin.

I'll see Salomé tomorrow afternoon.
I made a reservation this time.
I feel nothing.
She could cancel, she could leave me stranded and I wouldn't really care.
Part of me this exact moment is wondering what would happen if I'd just cancel.
There are two options floating in my head,
either that would save me the rejection or the awkwardness of having to
pretend interest until she loses hers.
I don't seem to even consider the chance that we'll both like each other.

It's not exactly like that with Alexandra.
I am a little excited of having her here.
She's the last woman I kissed.

Or did she kiss me?

Will I see Amanda?
She might reply later this week.
I thought about appending to my last message that I am, in fact,
free in the weekend.
It's better like this.

Are those all of the girls?
I should disclose my trans status before meeting anybody.
I don't want to go through the same thing with Catherine again.

Why, why did it have to be like Flore?
Would I have felt the same if, instead of just disappearing,
she had done that same thing, rejected me openly and directly?

I liked Amanda.
It wasn't just the sex.
I liked the conversation,
I liked the day we spent together and the night in my room.
I liked her taste and how it hurt when she pressed hardly on my back and bit
on my neck.

Will I be sad if she never replies back either?

What else could I write about?

Monica, like Melissa, replied to my last email about the photographies.

"Sí, tal vez habría sido incómodo para la chica que le pidieras una foto.
Tal vez si hay una segunda cita le podrías platicar lo que has hecho con tu cámara."

I felt tempted to reply right then and there and tell her how she was the one
that rejected me,
and the one whose rejection broke me a little in a way that none of the others
ever managed to.

I didn't.
I don't want to talk about it again.

## April, 2022

### Monday, April 4th, 2022
"You should come to my place next, maybe next week;
make use of the fact that I still don't have roommates yet."

I asked Alexandra if I could walk her to the bus station.
We kissed good-bye and she had already parted away when she turned around
and returned.

"I'll kiss you again before leaving."

Right now my anxiety would tell me that it was a sign of her not planning of
seeing me again.
Only for the fact that she was the one to suggest to see each other again and
she has already replied to my text.

I sent an email to Louis asking if he had heard any news from Sylvia.
I didn't see his first response telling me not to feel anxious and
that we'd figure it out.
His second response—the one that I saw—was him telling me that Sylvia said
yes and to tell everyone to hold the date.

I sent the first email just to IPN and Louis,
since it was the one that worried me.
Most of them have confirmed by now the calendar.
I'll be having my candidacy exam on May 17th.
I am still not sure if I want to schedule another meeting with the
Learning Support guy.

I was originally supposed to meet with Alexandra on Friday.
I showered and prepared mentally for it when she texted me asking if we could
postpone it to Sunday.
She would not be getting out of the lab soon and when she would
she'd probably be very tired.
She offered me the choice of moving it to Sunday—either her place or mine—or
she could come at around 21h.

After thinking about it for a bit I told her to come Sunday.

Saturday I did nothing.

I'm coming from the balcony with Alda.

Now I'm sitting down with two glasses of Mamajuana in front of her.
We are each lightened from the screens of our respective laptops.

What was I writing about?

Yesterday I sent Alexandra a text asking if she was still up for our meeting.
She replied asking if 14h was OK.

I showered and went outside to the park to meet with her and bring her in.
I got distracted and took a picture of the plant in the patio of that house
across the park.
I heard my name after trying to remember the aperture and speed of the shot
for the film log.

I showed her the place before we sat down to watch
_The Worst Person in the World_.

Around her first or second trip to the restroom, she asked me if I had a blanket.
I am not sure if she was actually cold or it was her try of repositioning us
even closer.

After the pizza came, I sat right next to her.
Under the blanket, I laid my leg above hers and felt the warmth of her full
arm pressing mine.

In the middle of _The House_ she wrapped her arm around me.
I fully laid my bodyweight on her and pressed my head on her shoulder.
I was conscious of each one of her fingers on my arm.
I was doubting if this shift wasn't instead during the first movie, but it wasn't.
I remember the exact point during the second fragment of the movie
when the seller is at the hospital after injuring himself with the bug repellent
that I, for a moment, forgot if it was the turn to inhale or exhale in my breathing.

When we shifted again I surrounded her.
I made a comment how nice her hair smelled and went towards it to kiss it.
I heard a couple of small laughs, but I am not sure what they meant.
She lifted her face and I met her lips.

After the movie ended and I wasn't sure if she were to stay or leave
we kissed again.

This time I kissed her neck and felt each of the fingers in her hand wrapping
my breast.

I sent a text to Amanda asking her if she's still up for our sunset walk this
Wednesday.

If it happens, it would be after she replies tomorrow.
If she doesn't answer back, then it won't.

I had a meeting this morning with Eduardo.
I told him about being bipolar and my difficulties managing time and projects.
He was understanding and warming.

Nico came back from his trip to Ontario.

I told Alda at the balcony how it all started with one dying plant
and now we have our very own full garden.

### Friday, April 8th, 2022
_Do you want to get coffee and at least put a face to the
person we're gonna potentially end up ghosting anyway?_

Two nights ago I walked 18km with Amanda.
I thought my idea of going to MtRoyal was something cute and original.

I was the sixth person with whom she did that exact thing.

She grabbed me by the arm when we were at the belvedere.
We didn't kiss up there.

On our way there, we passed a view of the city.
I offered my phone to her so she could take a picture.
I sent it to her today.

For a moment I thought she was going to leave me stood-up.
She warned me that she had missed her bus and would walk there,
arriving in around 45 minutes.

I had already left my apartment but since I had my camera with me,
didn't really mind.

As I got closer to Jeanne-Mance, my camera's shutter started getting stuck.
When I arrived at our rendezvous,
I decided to just take the roll out and try to fix it.
After that, I sat at a table listening to music.

"I'll tell you some things and just tell me if you like them or not
[...]
I'm just trying to see what else we can do later."

She invited me to the drag show that she and her roommates would put at their place.
It was supposed to be today.
She'd send me the details by Facebook.
I knew we didn't have each other, but maybe I said nothing.

We walked to a Tim Hortons and she asked if she could buy me the doughnut.
When she told me it was time for her to start walking home—and reassured that
it was not towards my place, but her own—,
after we hugged I asked her if I could kiss her.
We did.

Yesterday I found her on Facebook and sent her a friend request.
I regretted it.

Maybe I thought about Flore and that rejection.
Although I wouldn't see it until hours later,
less than a half an hour after I added her,
she sent me a message on Tinder saying that her phone was dead and they were
probably going to cancel the show.

In any case I could find her in Facebook as Amanda Brennan.

I didn't see her today.

I won't see her until August—if ever.

I sent a message on Monday to Alex asking her how her lab work was going.
She didn't reply.

I sent another one yesterday,
telling her about the Japanese festival that is happening,
in case she still wanted to meet this weekend.
That one, too, is still unanswered.

There is no difference in case we were to see each other if she had replied to
those messages or not, yet it still hurts.

Is it the vagueness of being ignored?
Is it the threat of abandonment that aches more than the rejection itself?

In my session with Calli I told her how I feel as if I'm distracting myself
with these women.

But from what?

I went to get two of my three rolls of film developed.
I bought two new rolls.
The rest of the afternoon I spent it at _the anticafe_, working.
I regret those two decisions.

I'm drinking right now.
I feel a bit like crying, but I am not sure the reason behind it.

Am I sad because of Amanda's departure?
I'll probably see her in three months.

Is it the unresponsiveness of Alexandra?
On her Whatsapp, it appears that the last time she signed on was
Wednesday's afternoon.
She must be busy.
Even if she were uninterested...
I'll either get an answer this weekend or next week,
or the week will pass and I'll feel better after moving on.

Maybe it's that I don't have any other girl to distract myself with.

Do I even want to go out?
I am supposed to be busy with my candidacy exam.
I could text Salomé—Alda told me to do it, and yet I didn't.

I don't really feel like going out.

Why am I this upset, then?

What the fuck is it that I want?

Neither the psychologist nor the photography club have replied either.

I was annoyed wiht IPN after they took so long to answer my questions,
and even more when the head of the department falsely told Louis I had gotten
reminders that never actually came.

What is it with me that I am so easy to ignore?

I posted on Instagram a picture of me without a bra.
I guess I am famished for attention.

## June, 2022

### Sunday, June 12th, 2022
"Your mother will let you go out alone. You will be free."

"Being free is being alone?"

I haven't been writing here for more than a month.
The missing boxes don't lie.

A couple of days ago I sent two e-mails.
One to Monica and another to Melissa.
I thought about sending one to Alex, but didn't.
I was exhausted. I don't remember what I wrote about except that I regretted
it today on my walk back home.

Monica surely rolled her eyes and whispered to herself that there I was,
talking about that same tiring theme.

Oren, my second therapist—the one that I was cheating on Calli with—would
bring up to my attention that I am mind-reading what Monica must have
reacted to my reaching out.

I feel the urge to mend the gap between that last entry and today;
talk about how I never met Alexandra again.
Her departure didn't break me the same way as others' silence did.
I kept trying to fill that void inside me with meaningless encounters.
_Fruitless_ is the word that comes to mind.

I joked with Alda about being a slut and she sharply answered back that I
was talking about being slutty with just one casual sex encounter months before.

In that last entry, I think I wrote about distracting myself with these women.
I keep bringing the subject up in therapy;
my insecurity, my abandonment issues, my repulsion to my own sexuality,
they all come down to the same thing.

I am a PhD candidate now.
In less than a week from now I'll be travelling to Scotland.

I texted my mum today about how after buying a tripod—again,
since that last time that I cancelled the order—it was stolen.
I saw the package box as we left to Ellelui's rooftop lesbian party.

Alda kissed a girl that I recognized from the apps.
She didn't like her but they kissed anyway.
Until now I hadn't thought again how when I saw her on the apps I
suspected she was trans.

I saw _Portrait de la jeune fille en feu_ again.
I wanted to see the other movie from that creator: _Petite maman_.

That's the movie that I asked Gabrielle out to see.
Sparky—the nickname for the Peanut's cartoonist—,
the girl I liked more than usual and who,
like the previous girl whom I similarly liked, rejected me softly suggesting
friendship instead.

I brought the subject up with Jessica, _the Brazilian wife_.
She hadn't see it, so I suggested it.
I had a date this Tuesday with another woman and yet I scheduled this one.
I have another one tomorrow with a French woman from Paris.

Why do I keep doing this to myself?

I am struggling again to write an article.
Like during my master's, I've got myself to a point of writing an
unconventional one.
Then, it was a multi-analysis ambitious study with lots of comparisons;
now, it's a software product instead of a study.

Louis must be getting tired of me.

Here it is again, putting words on other people's heads.

I haven't eaten all day and I keep postponing cooking food.

For breakfast I had a latte, for dinner half a bottle of wine.

For years I thought that I use alcohol as a way to control my overwhelming feelings.
Lately I've been thinking that it might be the other way around.
I use it to loose down the emotional block that impedes me to be aware of my
own feelings.

I've been holding texting Jessica again.
I use her reason of being a morning person and starting to shut off her brain
in the evening as an excuse to hide the real reason which is...

I got distracted trying to see what would Alda put on TV.
She started to watch the Dave Chappelle's show.
She didn't put it back on.
I feel the urge to make a comment about it instead of just telling her that
I am trans myself.

_Hey, do you know I am trans?_

I fantasize about what her reaction would be.

The real reason that I didn't text Jessica during, or after,
my walk home was that I am dreading her response telling me that she liked our
time together—as she answered my very direct question when we said goodbye—,
but didn't feel a strong enough connection.

Am I using these girls as practice?

Oren told me to focus on my breath as practice of being aware of my own body.

I don't feel like doing even that.

## July, 2022

### Tuesday, July 19th, 2022
"Tengo un agujero en el pecho, un vacío que me está tragando por dentro.
Tal vez se me dificulta describir cómo me siento porque no queda nada ya.
Estos días soy solo piel y grasa y hueso."

Without checking, I am not sure if it was a full month since the last time I wrote.
Nothing has happened; nothing ever happens.
Time keeps passing by and my life keeps slipping through.

I am almost 30 years old and I feel like a failure.

Therapy is almost over.
Did I ever write about how I stop seeing Calli to focus with Oren?
That is coming to a close.
He proposed that I continue seeing him after inquiring about insurance.
I lied to him and told him that I sent an e-mail that went ignored.
Even if it were true that after august it would be a clean slate and I would
be able to claim his sessions with insurance,
I doubt it would make any real difference.

It's not just the words, as I just wrote to Monica, I can't seem to write anything.
It is like my thoughts, just as my emotions, are muted.

I get frustrated by the block and feel an explosion in my throat and upper
chest that drives me to tears.

I sent her a very brief e-mail telling her that I am lost.

Yesterday, again, I brushed the razor against my thigh.

This time a very short but red streak appeared.
It was unintentional, but that word feels like a lie.
I put the razor against my skin with half intentions, like an empty promise.

With Calli, in our short keep-up sessions,
we talked about ways I could treat myself and help me in these low times.
One of those suggestions—she always ends up needing to suggest something after
I come up empty—was just letting myself sit and the emotions come and wash
me over; 5 minutes, even putting an alarm if needed.

Does this count?
Does the bottle of Vodka that I joked would be my dinner after our groceries
were delayed—again, for the second time—cancel it out?

Do I use alcohol as a self-medication to my depressive mood or a
debilitation to my over-worked judging self?

These words are supposed to be uncensored and free,
yet I feel bothered by this thought that keeps me from writing about the women
I've dated or their rejections.

I deleted the apps; again.
I will not try to fool myself by pretending that I have deleted them for good.
I have just had enough.
I am sick of being rejected and feeling disgusting.
I am tired of going out and feeling apathetic to the empty suggestion of
meeting again by the girl who didn't spark anything in me.

I met Héloïse.
She stayed the night and Nico—who today just left Canada—asked me if she was a
one-night-stand outside the _dépanneur_ the last night I saw him before the
candle game.

She wore my shorts and t-shirt.
She cried her failed relationship on my bed,
with a face contorted in pain and snot dripping down her nose.
I heard her speak in french to her bank and her potential job offers
while I uncomfortably texted with Alda about her overstaying and considering
kicking her out.

She texted me later that afternoon and then again a couple of days after.

When I offered her to stay the night,
she was bothered by my addendum of _with no intentions_ to the choice of
sleeping in my bed instead of the couch.

"She was not made of porcelain", she assured me.

After wondering how to say it without being blunt, she settled on saying
she was sick of this predatory feelings related to sexuality.

If I wanted to have sex with her,
I could just make my move and she would just tell me no and continue as if
nothing had happened.

There was no need for this silly dance.

Although she hit a sensitive point, her argument was sound.

I want to tell myself that I had no intentions of making any move since I lost
all attraction given her unshaven legs and musky smell,
or her failed relationship talk.

It's nonsense, though, given how I grabbed her wandering hand when it
emigrated to my pillow and considered yesterday asking her whether
she had been disappointed or relieved by my lack of moves.

I did not.
The question is moot and it was mostly driven by the soft rejection I got from
Jessica, the Brazilian married girl.

Did I wanted her to say that she was disappointed so I would feel less
unattractive or was I expecting her to unrealistically confess that she was
relieved and confirm my own unfair self-judging?

## November, 2022

### Wednesday, November 2nd, 2022
I am starting on the second day of the month.
Feels augurous that, no matter how hard I try to keep at it,
it will end up being meaningless in relation to completing the full month.

That sentence makes no sense.

Louis said once that writing is all about putting your ideas in order.
There's nothing more to it.

My wine tastes like vinegar.
Lately I've been eating more salads.
It's ironic that I have also been gaining weight somehow.
The aftertaste of the wine is similar to the shitty flavor that lingers in my
mouth every other bite with the salad dressing that I have been using.

I craved wine because I wanted to mute the feelings.
I say in therapy how I want to be more in touch with my emotions,
but at the first notice of anything coming from within I shut it down with
drugs or alcohol.

For a while I stopped looking for distractions in going out with strangers.

The last time that I had shrooms I came to the realization that it's a
desperate try to convince myself that I am desirable.
A non-awful non-unlovable person.
What other choice would I have but accept myself,
if I find someone who actively decides to share my company?

I am hating these words.
The whole purpose of them is to be uncensored.
A similar attempt to free-association.
The other day the thought crossed my mind about missing my time with René.
Talking about everything and nothing,
let the emotions and thoughts flow.
He reprimanded me once about how I wasted all that time talking about
nothing but school and inconsequential stuff.

It was very similar to how my mom would scold me about pretending to be an idiot
when it had not been intention at all.
Were my defenses unconscious yet strong or was I really an idiot?

It's not even half of the mark and I am ready to drop this.
I have nothing to say.
There is no point.

I feel depressed, maybe.

I am considering stopping with my medication.

Yesterday I got an e-mail notifying me that the insurance company had come to
a resolution regarding my latest claim.
Usually that means that they have deposited the money from my prescriptions.
This time the amount was much less than what I was expecting.
Instead of the 150 dollars, it was less than 50.
Just the hormones were registered in the application.
I browsed the previous claims and deposits and every time all three of them
were resolved on the same day, at the same time.

Will this be an issue going forward?
How convenient for them that the most expensive medication is the one that
was not covered.

I considered waiting until today and call the number in the application.
I wrote an email instead and schedule it to be sent this morning.

It was not.
I had to send it manually by noon.

I was going to go to Thomson house with Alda today,
but in the end she changed her mind.

I went to the lab instead and attended the Feindel brain and cognition seminar.
Today it was a talk given by a friend of Louis.
He sent us an e-mail saying he expected to see us there.
Most of the lab was there.

Yesterday we did go to Thomson house.
I asked Alda again if she planned to renew the lease.
She said no.
We talked then about looking for a different place together.
How could we tell Jose Luis, he would surely take it badly if he knew that
Alda and I are leaving and looking for a place together.

I did not care, even though, were I in his place,
I would definitely take it personal.

I have French class again tomorrow.
I am considering sending an e-mail that I won't be able to attend.

I cannot think of any viable reason why.
I haven't gotten a single cheque.
I am still not sure if I am going to receive 15 or 25 dollars per day of class.

I am still struggling with money and here I am thinking about moving to a different,
probably much more expensive apartment.

What the fuck am I thinking?

This week a med student texted me in one of the apps.

"Please text me again" she said that night.

I did and, two days later, haven't gotten a response.

I texted the latest French girl.

Do I even want to meet any of them?

What the fuck is it that I want?

### Sunday, November 6th, 2022
It didn't stay, the urge to continue writing.

I feel both the urging need of writing something and the frustration
about having nothing in particular to say.
# 2023 — 30 years old

## June, 2023

### Monday, June 19th, 2023
I keep doing it again.

I keep leaving the phone unattended,
making myself busy with the tasks of everyday life and pretending the hope that
whenever I go back to it there will be a new message is not there.

I keep going back to the memories of last week,
revisiting the images and sensations,
trying to juice out every last bit of them while I can.

I keep reaching out to strangers to fill out something that is missing.
Today is Monday but I don't want to write about today.
This is the first day of the break from my French classes.
I have been going for a year to French courses.
Last week was the last week.
I remember when I was a kid and my mom was friends with Miguel's english
teacher how I shared with both of them my frustrations of how,
even after studying english for years, I did not know how to speak it.

Until last week I felt the same with French.
I can't understand the francophone strangers that pass me by.
I struggle to get what the québécois people on the internet talk about if there
are no captions.
I still needed to double-check in the translator when I wanted to reply to the
e-mail from my new landlord reminding me about giving him the cheques next
month that I'll move in.

Two weeks ago I started talking with Alexia.
She texted me first.
She was a French girl visiting Montréal for two weeks.
Today, when I went back to her profile,
her finally updated distance marked the 5,721 kilometers that are between here
and Toulouse.
Her first texts were in English.
Shortly after that she asked if I knew French as she was a beginner and
worried that she would make mistakes.
We switched languages.

She proposed going to the botanical garden the following week after she
returned to Montréal from her trip to Toronto.
We settled on Tuesday, after I would be finished with the evaluation from French.
Monday, though, I was not able to pass and do the oral production portion of the
evaluation and thus I would not be able to miss class the next day.
She had said that she was also available Wednesday, so I asked her to postpone.
Another option, I proposed, was to meet either before or after my class,
if 21h was not too late for her.
She agreed to both.

That same Monday, exactly a week ago, Sophia changed the plans of our date and
proposed meeting today for a drink and walk through the mountain.
We had joked about having a first date with another Sof/phia.

The morning of the following Tuesday I went to the lab.
I felt nervous about my French test, but not the one from class.
What if I were not able to understand her?
What if I failed to make myself be understood?
How awful would it feel for her to change the plans of the second portion of
our date after my failure?
We agreed to meet at 15h and thus I left the office half an hour earlier.

I walked towards downtown as slowly as I could.
I felt sick in my stomach.
I considered cancelling even though I knew it was not really an option.
Was I or was she the first one to arrive?
She texted me that she was waiting in front of the italian cafe.
Only once before had I been inside the _caffettiera_.
That time before, Amanda was also the first to arrive.
That time before, Amanda's date was also a two-parter.
No, it was three-parts.

I was nervous.
If she was, too, I did not notice.
We kept talking about nothing in particular, as first dates usually go.
It was awkward in a charming way.
_Ça va bien?_, she kept asking whenever I stayed silent,
either because I was thinking about what to say next or trying to formulate
the french in my head.

My head is hurting right now.
I feel the effect of my pills and want to finish so I can go back to bed.

The alarm I put to signal the moment I should leave for french made my wrist
vibrate.
I apologized and told her that I would just go to the toilets and then we
could leave.
I confirmed whether she was still down to meeting after and she said yes.
Even after her confirmation I was almost sure that I would not hear from her.
Her match would disappear.
She would text me saying how despite having a great time maybe it was better
to leave it like that.
Perhaps I would text her that I was ready to meet and my messages would go
unreplied.

That particular French class was the longest one ever.
Before the pause, some students asked the professor if it was possible to skip
it and go out earlier instead.
He said that sure, we would leave just 15 minutes before, at 20h45.
They decided to have the pause instead.
Even though we did not take his offer, he let us leave 20 minutes before 21h.
I started texting Alexia to meet me at station Montmorency of the orange line.
Grace and the professor were in the station.

"Sofia, est-ce que tu as changé d'appartement?
Tu n'es jamais venue à prendre le metro."

Alexia did reply.
I realized that Montmorency was the direction of the trip and not the destination.
I corrected myself and warned her that it would take me 40 minutes to arrive
while Grace was talking to me.
This time I waited for her at station Mont-Royal.

...I can't do this. I will finish tomorrow.

### Tuesday, June 20th, 2023
I was sitting on a bench by the entrance of the metro station.
I noticed her arrival by the shape of her hair and the color of her denim jacket.
Did she smile when she saw me? Did I?

In the conversation with Sophia, she had mentioned _Le Majestique_.
I thought I had already been there, but the bar I had in mind was _Le Darling_.
Both of them were on Saint-Laurent and both of them were good options.
I asked her if she did not mind walking for a bit;
as a third option I had picked up another bar in Saint-Denis,
just a couple steps away from the station.

Rue Saint-Laurent was soulless.
Even she noted how she would have imagined more people wandering around.
Alda would later say that it was expected given it was a Tuesday night.
It felt as if we had the street to ourselves.
I asked her if she preferred a terrace or going inside.
We then entered the bar.

We both ordered a pint of beer.
As I had been talking in French, it felt unnatural to suddenly switch to
English just to make my order.

"Je sais que je viens de parler en Français toute la soirée,
mais je me sens fiere de moi de commander ma biére en Français."

She asked me a couple of times if I had gotten tired of speaking French.
We could try to switch to English whenever I wanted, she reassured me.
I threw back the question to her of whether she had gotten annoyed by trying
to understand me, but she dismissed that thought.
We kept talking about France and our jobs and computers.

She was finishing her drink faster than me.
When I noticed it I realized that I was feeling scared of ending mine
and thus concluding the night.
I grabbed the glass as if that would prevent the waiter to take it from me and
sending us home.
She asked if I had the intention of ordering another one.
I told her that I would if she did.
And so we ordered them.

I kept talking in French even when I stood up from our table and asked about
the location of the restrooms.
I had a text from Alda asking me where I was and if she should be worried.

I shared her worries with her.

"Ma coloc a oublié que je suis ici avec toi et elle etait préocuppée de moi.
Je suis sûre que je lui ai dit que je viendrais avec toi."

I held off the urge to keep going.
_Je lui ai raconté de mon premier rendez-vous français;
est-ce que tu as raconté de moi à quelqu'un ?_

I drank my second beer even slower than the first one.
I confessed how I did not want to leave when the waiter came to tell us it was
the last call.
We kept talking when they brought us the bill.
We both looked at each other when he asked us if it was going to be together
or separate.
This time she took it.

We went outside and I told her that I was cold.

"Tu veux porter ma veste ?"

I said no.
We kept walking through the empty street and my arm kept brushing hers,
but she did not move it.
After some steps, I dared to grab her arm and get closer to her.
Still, she did not move.

We continued walking to the end of St-Laurent.
I asked her to tell me whenever she was ready to leave but we decided instead
to just turn back and keep going from where we came.

I did not let her go even while I was pointing to the different places that I
had visited before and giving small reviews.
We passed _bar biftek_, and told her how I had played pool with Aliza a couple
of weeks before.
She offered to play and we considered it.
We thought how we might need to buy another drink at the bar so we kept walking.
We got to a fence filled with posters for upcoming events that neither of
us would ever go to.
I asked her again if she wanted to leave but we turned towards my place.
By this point I was becoming aware of a possibility that I had not considered
and the notion that I needed to disclose an important piece of information
that I had not yet shared.

Again, like earlier in the afternoon, I started feeling sick in my stomach.

We passed through _Parc Jeanne-Mance_.

"Qu'est-ce que tu veux faire ?", I asked her a couple of times in our path.

"Ce que tu veux", she kept replying.

By the time we passed the McGill Gymnasium,
I pointed at the same bench where last year Alda asked me about my periods.

"Peut-on s'asseoir un peu ?", I said after a deep breath.

As we sat she reciprocated the gesture and placed her hand on my thigh and smiled.
I got closer to her and just sat there.
In a minute or two, I felt the whole night passing us by in silence.

"...Ça va bien ?", she asked again but in a much different tone than earlier
in the afternoon.

I kept hiding my face in her neck.

"Oui, ça va bien. J'ai juste besoin d'un moment",
I told her while I looked straight towards downtown.

I grabbed my final breath before finally coming out.

"Je t'ai pas dit; je suis trans."

When I dared to look at her, she replied.

"Je savais pas."

I am not sure how much time passed from that moment until I looked at her lips
begging for an invitation.
Almost instantly she moved her face towards me.
I don't know who was the one to give the final steps closing the breach between
us.

We kissed one, two and three times.
The fourth, I put my hand on her waist.
During the fifth, she grabbed me by the neck.
After the seventh, I felt her thigh right were her hand had laid upon my leg.

When she looked at her phone it was almost two in the morning.

"Je peux te raccompagner chez toi, si tu veux", she had said.

I was too afraid to get lost in translation and accidentally cutting off the
night, so I kept postponing the end.

Finally my body betrayed me.

"Je voudrais rester ici avec toi, mais il faut aller aux toilettes."

She agreed and we stood up to start our march.
Did I grab her by the arm again?

I reminded her about my main reason for moving away from the neighborhood
as we were climbing the hill besides _Hôpital Royal Victoria_.
We got closer and closer and I pointed towards the Leonard Cohen spot.
Without realizing it at the moment,
I made a throwback comment to the first story I told her about my favourite
spot in Montreal.

When we arrived home, I opened the door and came in without waiting for her
response.
She came in with me.

Every girl who has entered my room has made some sort of comment about its
spaciousness.
Will I end up missing my room in a couple of weeks that I'll finally leave
this home?

I went first to the toilet and then started tidying up a bit while she took her
turn to the restroom after being by herself in my room.
She came back and shyly asked permission to stay the night.
I agreed without realizing that a part of me felt fortunate.

We sat on the bed and shortly after continued where we had left off by the
gymnasium.
I started this journal entry as a way to write down my thoughts.
I kept going to them throughout the day like little treasures.
Time by time, they faded with each passing.
One could argue this is the main thought, the night we spent together,
the progressively faster kissing, the wandering touches, the warm sensations.
These are the details that I want to imprint against fading.
Yet, I cannot remember them, not fully and not clearly.
Even through my usual walks through the memories, I fall shortly.
I deambulate by the placement of her hand on my thigh and wander in the
preamble of the first kiss.
I never get to the lip-biting nor the cold sensation of sweat in her back.

She asked me to go _plus doucement_. I found the perfect rhythm.

As I told Alda today while I was alone in the lab, I did not finish.
It did not matter.
As usual I found my pleasure in her later caresses,
the soft exploration of her fingers,
the barely touch of her bare skin through all my body.

"Ça te dérange?", she had asked.
I absentmindedly agreed and she pulled away instinctively.
Almost as fast, I stretched my arms and pulled her towards me again.
Throughout the night I held her.
I held her body, as I am now holding down to this thoughts.

The one thing I remember from the middle of the morning was her reaching
around me to grab the comforter.
She covered us with it and took back her position.

Eventually we slept.
In the morning, I woke up and thought about Alda.
Had she heard us?
Would she see her?
As my mind wandered, so did my finger through her arm.

All night, one way or another I kept touching her.
Be it the hand by the end of my arm which hear head was lying upon,
or her arm over my chest arriving after her turning towards my side.

Once or twice I would grab her and she would raise her face towards mine and
kiss me.
We would kiss one, two, or sometimes three times before she recoiled back down.

My alarm sounded a quarter before 8h.
Moments later she would ask me if I kept intending to work around noon.
I laughed, dismissed the thought and went back to hiding from time under the
covers with her.

Between 10h and 11h we did get up.
We started assigning our clothes and putting life back on ourselves.
I put on my glasses.

"Je peux te voire encore."

She gathered the will to start her explanations about her departure before I
realized the misunderstanding and abruptly ceded.

"Non, non, avec mes lunettes."

I walked her down the garage.
Passing through, she mentioned something about her day at _le jardin botanique_
that I did not fully understand.

That _I must go once_, I think; that _I could go with her_, I feared.

We kissed three times before we said our good-byes.

I came back home to my room.
I lied down again and I slept.
I slept calmly, so peacefully that the full day could have passed me over and
for the purpose of this entry it did.

The last time I had sex was with the Québécoise girl I met at Santropol,
the same café I met the very first girl I dated and the same café I
met the very last.
She was looking for some girl to have her first lesbian experience and I was
looking for someone to rub off my loneliness.

After our exchange and her departure that same night,
she deleted the match and with it every remnant of contact between us.
With her sudden leaving I felt uneasy, I felt used.

All throughout the day,
I kept opening Tinder to make sure that Alexias name was still showing.

I dared to take a screenshot as a trophy.
One or two pictures with her name as way to make sure that I would not forgive
her, as if it was possible, or her name, as it has happened with the very girl
that preceded her.

Using this idea of missed acknowledgment and closure as an excuse, I texted her.

"Hey, j'espère que tu as profité le jardin et ta soirée avec tes amis
(est-ce que c'est ton anniversaire ? ).
Je sais pas si le plan était toujours de avoir seulement un rencontre d'une nuit.
J'aimerais de te revoir mais je comprends aussi que c'est très difficile
d'avoir si peu de temps à Mtl. Merci pour la belle soirée !
( Et pour avoir toleré mon français ).
J'ai passé un bon moment, je suis très contente de te recontrer."

The next morning I went to therapy as excited to talk about this as I was the
previous morning when Alda finally came out of her room and asked me about it.
She had heard a voice different to mine and realized what had happened.
As I was walking towards my session, I noticed the number one above the tinder
icon.
I opened the application but escaped before reading the message.
I did not want to open it, not yet.

Once again, I did not want the end to come sooner than it absolutely had to.

I exclaimed to Calli how I knew I should feel happy,
yet I felt a sort of sadness.

"Sofía, of course you feel sad!".

_Hey, oui, j'ai bien profité du jardin botanique et oui c'etait mon anniversaire,
c'est pour ça que j'avais de plein de trucs prevus en fin de journée.
J'aurais bien aimé te revoir mais je repars demain en France,
je n'aurais pas le temps...
Désolée qu'on ne puisse pas se revoir.
J'ai beacucoup aimé la soirée, tu parles très bien français et j'ai passé un
très bon moment avec toi._

Yesterday that I started this entry I was coming back from my date with Sophia.
We walked through the mountain like that one time I met another french girl
whose name has evaporated from memory.
We talked about her starting med school and the different opportunities in the
city to meet new people.
There was a comment during the middle of the date where she reassured me there
would be many opportunities where I could meet other people.
I don't know from where in her voice or words did I sense a
condescension that put me off.
Like a switch, I turned off and realized nothing would come out of the experience.
We walked back from _le lac aux castors_ towards _Parc Jeanne-Mance_
where we finally separated on our own ways to never reach out back towards
each other again._

### Tuesday, June 27th, 2023
I woke up in the early morning but decided to stay in bed.
I covered my head between the pillows as I usually do after turning off the
alarm and deciding that I will not go to the office.
In my mind it was just the beginning of the week.
No pending tasks.

Saturday I hung out with Alda.
She dog-sitted for her sister and her brother-in-law.
We had made a bet about her not being able to follow through and commit to
watching the movie Primer.
I owed her a Poutine that we ordered to be delivered at her sister's.
We smoked and watched television.
What did we watch?

Rubi and Cynthia came to Montreal that same Saturday.
I met her the next day.
The plan was to grab a coffee at Olimpico and catch up.
In my head it would be an informal meet-up of an hour or two at most.
It ended up being a full weekend.

Still tired, today I got up at 11h with the false promise that I would finish
the two posters that I barely touched.
I brewed the last portion of grounded coffee beans and came to sit down in the
living room.
Ridden with guilt from procrastination,
I stumbled upon a TikTok about therapy and remembered I had a session early
this week.
I rushed to my calendar and saw the past event of my appointment with Calli
at 9 in the morning.

Sunday morning Rubi texted me about meeting.
No, I texted her how we had not agreed on a time.
Planning changed and we decided to meet in the gay village.
I found them without needing to text them.
They were talking with a man, latino, in front of the bar the went to the day
before.
Cynthia was with Rubi.
I met Cynthia at Rubi's wedding in San Diego, 5 years ago.
Cynthia would later tell me how that day she had talked to me about being sad
from the rejection of a man after he realized she was a pre-op trans woman.
I am not sure if she was me with whom she talked that day.
It could had been Melissa.

From there we walked to Old Port.
We took picture in front of _la grande roue_.
In particular, Rubi really liked the picture I took of her in front of the Wheel.
It is now her profile picture in Facebook.

_Of course, she's a photographer_, she would tell her lawyer friends hours later
when we were having dinner in Caffe Un Po' Di Piu.

We rode the wheel and walked around the port.
They told me about Cynthia's surgery last year.
Sex Reassignment Surgery.
Months ago, I read a tweet about how that name is an euphemism.
Is sex being really reassigned?
It is really a Genital Reconstruction Surgery.
A vaginoplasty, more precisely.
No.
Like the doctor told Cynthia on that same day before the procedure,
the surgery consists of three distinct operations,
an orchiectomy, an extirpation of the tissue inside the penis followed by its
inversion, and, finally, a vulva construction.
Three hundred thousand dollars costed the surgery.
It was covered by her insurance.

We met Alma and Amanda outside the Café.
Alma asked me if we had met before since my face looked very familiar.
The place would not open for another 15 minutes.
Cynthia needed to pee, so we went to an italian place nearby and sat to order
a round of tequila shots.
When the time was ready for the reservation we went back to the restaurant.
We were the first party to be seated.
We had dessert at Chat-colate, where Cynthia got herself a cone of ice cream
and the rest of us shared a crêpe.
When we went back to the table after ordering, Amanda was crying.
The next day Alma and Rubi would talk about her.
Rubi asked her if she is taking medication.
Alma would tell her to please not tease her about her drinking.

We sat at the terrace of Bar Henrietta and ordered beers.
I had been to that place before.
Was it one of my dates?

I walked as trans.
Am I read as trans in mine?
Cynthia turned off the lights and gave us a glimpse of how her body had
recuperated months after what was shown in the pictures.

When we were sitting by the port, Rubi asked me again if having the operation
was something I wanted.
I told her that I did not know.

Back at their apartment, we talked about Cynthia's operation.
She had showed me the pictures after her surgery at the Café.
Rubi noted how the waiter was looking at us possibly disturbed.
Did I worry walking around with Rubi and Cynthia about being clocked?

When I left, Rubi ordered me an uber home.
They were almost offended by my intention of taking the bus.

The plan for next day was to climb the mountain.
I sent a text to Rubi when I woke up and we plan to meet at 11h at the
monument, like Alma had suggested at the terrase.
At 10h15 she texted me they were on their way.
I got there before Rubi and Cynthia.
I saw Alma sitting there but decided against approaching her.
I met them after I saw Rubi and Cynthia arrive.

We had breakfast at a place nearby.
I ordered a burger, Rubi and Cynthia got a breakfast platter and
Alma just had coffee.
I found the waitress particularly attractive with her brown hair and light eyes.

Later in the day we went to Alma's house.
She has three kids and a husband.
Today I confessed to Alda how after feeling uncomfortable with my silly crush
on her I also felt some sort of attraction towards her husband;
both of them easily in their forties.

At our own terrace, after I talked to Alda about Rubi and Cynthia,
she brought up the bandmate or friend of Lucas who is "trans also".
She mentioned the pre-transition drugs, spiro, like the dragon,
and the name of their disc is girldick.

I texted Laurie-Eve about her moving-in date,
specifically if her offer to come in later was still available.
I sent her some pictures of the furniture and agreed to leave the room on the
3rd.
This will be my last week living with Alda.
I will probably end up moving out without ever telling her about me.

### Thursday, June 29th, 2023
I might have walked home this route for the last time.
I got a text from Laurie confirming that they will not take the bed and the
rest of the furniture before the fourth.
Tomorrow is a holiday so I can stay home guilt-free and spend most of the day
putting my clothes and stuff in the suitcases in preparation for Saturday.

I had thought about texting Didier to ask him the time I can pass by to pick
up the keys and give him the cheques.
I feel nervous about starting writing on them and messing up.

Walking by Hôpital Victoria I felt a familiar sense of anguish thinking that
the cheques I ordered a month ago from a private company will not work.

Last night I considered doing the words but felt too tired by the pills I
took an hour before.
I went to the lab for the first half of the day.

Waking up I had regretted buying the tickets for the lesbian-queer-trans
happy hour thing at Ping-Pong Club.

I came home at 5 and tried on one of the pleaded skirts.
It did not close around my waist.
I considered wearing the other black skirt instead.

"Should I wear pants or a skirt?", I asked Alda.

"Dress", was her one-word reply.

Aliza asked me if there was a dress-code and I dismissed her telling her I was
going to wear cargo pants.
I was not convinced by Alda,
yet I put out the red dress from my closet and tried it on.
I wore make up and braided my hair.

While I was working yesterday, Monica asked me to look up flights to Montréal
for her.
I procrastinated from working on my posters by finding differently-priced ways
of coming to see me: directly from Los Angeles,
from San Diego with a 6-hour layover in Las Vegas, making a stop in Vancouver.

After being disappointed last year with Monica's empty promise,
I let myself get excited thinking about all the stuff that we could do in the
week she would be here.
Mid-planning, I postponed the initial search a week so it would lie on the
same week that I am off from French classes.

"Pero estaría en mi bday contigo, perra, yass."

The plan was to arrive at the bar at a quarter after seven.
Aliza told us that she was running a little late and thus would meet us there.
When I checked the schedule for the 144 bus,
the app said that the next one would pass in 60 minutes.
We walked towards station Guy-Concordia.
Alda made a stop at Coco-bun and got herself a baked hot-dog and a lemonade.

At station Berri-UQAM, Aliza asked us where we were after I told her Alda
had made a stop for food.
Maybe we could meet at station Rosemont.
Aliza herself was one station behind us.
We mounted the same train she was in.
We walked throught the wagons until we met with her at the very front.

Just two days before Aliza had returned from her trip to Mexico.
Today in the couch Alda mentioned how she does not think that her
relationship with Ali will last long.
I do not know how long they have been together.
Do I agree with her?

From the metro station we talked the same bridge Alda,
her friend Abby and I had walked years ago going to Notre-dame-des-quilles.
Just like that experience, Ping-Pong Club was a disappointment.
We got in and sat in a booth.
Most people were there in groups and, like us, stayed with their companions.
I kept glancing at the two or three girls I noticed had arrived alone and were
sitting by themselves distracting themselves with their own glasses.
By the time we left, all of them were talking to people.
I did not know if their friends caught up with them or they were approached by
strangers.
I felt happy for them.

I told both Alda and Aliza, at different moments, that my ex would possibly
come to Montreal in a couple of months.

We decided to grab dinner before heading home.
Alda found a place for dumplings that was close to our home.
We considered ordering an uber but decided to ride the metro instead.
We got there and asked the man at the entrance if he had any tables available
for us.
He looked around for some reason before telling Alda that it would not be possible.

"Just take-out".

We ended up instead getting Pho from the place we were going to order from
when I was with Rubi and Cynthia a couple nights before.
The three of us ordered large bowls.
I ordered the classic all-dressed pho.
Aliza got herself one with just well-done meat.
Alda went for the spicy beef and pork soup.
I was the only one who finished hers.

When we were in line to pay, Aliza showed me her phone with a tweet from Sof Poiré.
I asked her if she knew her.
Before she could answer, I continued:

"Have I told you the story about my three-way kiss?", I asked her.

"No..."

"Or the story about the time I kissed another Sofía. Well, she's that Sofía."

I told her pieces of the story of how I kissed her and her ex before they were
even together.
I told her I would tell her that story later.
She asked if she could share it with Ali.
Later she would tell me how she started following Sof because of me.
Because of Sof, she saw the tweet that was offering the job she took out of the
master's.

I finished the posters and sent them to the coauthors for their comments.
Without anything else to do,
I started to work again on the two papers that I keep avoiding.

I did not have much to talk about with Louis for our meeting,
so I brought up a subject that, like my papers, I kept postponing.
I asked him when should I start working about setting the ground for my post-doc.
I had just asked him to confirm that he had done his in France.
He was at Rennes.
Monica lived in Rennes.
I told him I personally did not want to move and would rather stay in Canada.
Do I see myself living in France, though?
I remember fondly the days I spent in Spain.
At least the first half of them.

He told me he could start introducing me to people at the conferences.
I have my work to speak for me and we could see about doing some collaborations.
I feel like those lonely girls milking their drinks sorrounded by cliques of
lesbians and queers in laughter.
I do not know how to start the conversations.
Were not for the swedish undergrad who approached me in that mixer in Glasgow,
I would have spent the rest of that conference by myself.

Will I get to meet again some of the people I made acquaintances of in Glasgow
or San Diego?
Would they remember me?

Would I? Two nights ago, when I finished my words,
I saw the notice for a new feature which allows for the reparation of a missed
streak by doing double the words.
I was just about to finish for the night 500 words before this but decided to
continue.
There has not been any notification or proposal giving me the option for that.
Will I continue for another 250 just for the possibility of it?
What else do I have to say?

Am I feeling better?
For months I have not written anything.
I feel empty inside; both my body and my mind.

One day, walking towards the station Guy-Concordia I shared with Alda my idea
of stopping my medications.
It is neither the first time that I have considered it nor that I told someone else.
Am I asking for their permission?
Do I want them to convince me otherwise?

I was almost going to complete a double-day without making any mention of dating.
Last night I told Aliza how I have been growing as a person and thus stopped
giving nicknames to the women I see.
I set a date to meet Noémie next week.
Cheekily I told her I could pick the time and she could pick the spot.
A day before I can ask her to confirm.

I had been talking to Marion, too.
She picked up the conversation asking me about my weekend.
I confessed to her that I had only a vague idea of how she looked.
She was in the same situation and could not refresh her memory since she had
deleted her tinder.
She asked for the name I had on Facebook so she could remind how do I look.
After looking at it she told me I was just as she remembered me.
I told her how when we meet, it would be her responsibility to approach me
since I would not recognize her in the crowd.
We joked about it and the conversation got to its natural end again.
