reference.py
-------------------

Defines the Reference class used to track appearing throughout the journal:
- meaningful quotations
- fragments
- citations
- poems

References may come from external sources (books, poems, lyrics)
or internal ones (original lines, self-poems, recurring phrases).

Some references appear as epigraphs, others are embedded within entries.
All are tracked with source, context.
Optionally there is a shared identifier linking versions or repetitions.
