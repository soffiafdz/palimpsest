# Narrative Analysis Guidelines

## Objective

Analyze journal entries located in `data/journal/content/md/[YEAR]` for an auto-fiction manuscript. There are two analysis modes:

1. **Core Analysis** (Nov 2024 - Dec 2025): The main story arc
2. **Flashback Analysis** (2021 - Oct 2024): Earlier entries evaluated for flashback/braided narrative potential

---

## Flashback Analysis Mode

### Purpose

Entries from 2021-2024 (pre-November) are evaluated for their potential as:
- **Braided narrations**: Parallel events that echo the main story
- **Flashbacks**: Past events that complement or illuminate main themes

### Pre-Requisites

Before beginning flashback analysis, read all narrative analyses from the core story period (Nov 2024 - Oct 2025) to familiarize yourself with:
- The primary romantic obsession (Léa) and its patterns
- The key people: Bea, Amanda, Alexia, Inès, Paty, Sonny, Alda, Aliza, Fabiola
- The 15 thematic arcs (see consolidated_tags_themes.md)
- The narrative rhythms and climactic moments

### Flashback Rating Criteria

The rating scale is recalibrated with **much stricter standards**:

- **1/5:** No meaningful connection to main themes or characters. Routine logistics.
- **2/5:** Minor thematic echo but no narrative potential as flashback.
- **3/5:** Interesting parallel but not essential. Could be cut without loss.
- **4/5:** Strong flashback candidate. Significant thematic resonance, character origin story, or event that directly illuminates the main narrative.
- **5/5:** Essential flashback. Too powerful to omit—directly prefigures or echoes a core moment.

**Strictness increases with temporal distance:**
- 2024 (pre-Nov): Moderate strictness
- 2023: Stricter
- 2022: Very strict
- 2021: Strictest—only truly essential material

### Key Echoes to Hunt

- **Bea**: The date and night with Bea (referenced in main story)
- **Alexia**: The night at Le Darling
- **Amanda**: Context before her return in Sept 2025
- **Emily**: The first catfisher (parallels Gaelle)
- **Paty**: The almost-kiss dynamic (parallels Léa)
- **Trans disclosure moments**: Previous coming-out patterns
- **Obsessive surveillance patterns**: Pre-Instagram era equivalents
- **Origin stories**: First appearances of recurring motifs (red anklet, specific songs, photography)

### Flashback Analysis Format

Same format as core analysis, plus:
- **People:** Separate list of people mentioned
- **Locations:** Separate list of locations mentioned

## Core Analysis Mode

### Analysis Process

1. **Locate Files:** List the markdown files for the target month in `data/journal/content/md/[YEAR]`.
2. **Process One by One:** Read a file, analyze it, and create a corresponding report file in `data/journal/narrative_analysis/` with the naming convention `[YYYY-MM-DD]_analysis.md`.
3. **Analysis Format:**
    - **Summary:** A concise summary of the events, focusing on narrative arcs (Léa, HRT crisis, friendships, professional life) and emotional impact.
    - **Narrative Rating:** A strict **1-5** scale based on **raw potential for a literary manuscript**.
      - **1/5:** Purely logistical, repetitive, or meta-analysis without narrative scenes. (e.g., Clinical reports, repetitive venting).
      - **2/5:** Meta-fictional exercises (letters to self, imagined confessions) or low-stakes domestic filler. Interesting psychologically but static narratively.
      - **3/5:** Bridge entries. Necessary context, maintenance of themes, or minor character beats. Good but not standalone.
      - **3.5/5:** Strong character work or specific interesting details (e.g., specific songs, minor conflicts), but lacking a major plot turn.
      - **4/5:** High potential. Strong scenes, vivid imagery, significant emotional movement, or crucial thematic resonance (e.g., "The Red Anklet," "Anger as Drowning").
      - **4.5/5:** Near-perfect. Visceral, devastating, or structurally brilliant. (e.g., The manic shift, the "first kiss" memory).
      - **5/5:** Essential. The core pillars of the manuscript. Climactic confrontations, major plot twists, or devastating emotional breakthroughs. (e.g., The shower seizure, the "Anti-date," the "Double Exposure" reveal).
      - **CRITICAL:** Do _not_ be sycophantic. Be a harsh editor. If an entry is boring or repetitive, rate it low.
    - **Tags:** A list of practical, searchable keywords (e.g., People, Locations, Objects, Emotions, Specific Events).
    - **Themes:** A bulleted list of the underlying themes explored in the entry (e.g., "The Body as Archive," "Digital Surveillance," "Scarcity").

4. **Content Guidelines:**
    - **Tags:** Keep them simple and useful for retrieval (e.g., "Inès," "Léa," "Metro," "Insomnia").
    - **Justification:** The justification for the rating must be specific. Quote the text. Explain _why_ it works or fails as a scene.
    - **Meta-Narrative Entries:** Entries that are meta-text (Clinical notes, imagined letters) generally receive lower narrative ratings (1-2) because they are "telling" not "showing," unless they contain a breakthrough insight that can be dramatized.

## Context to Remember

### The Arcs

- **Léa:** The primary romantic obsession. Defined by silence, ambiguity, and digital breadcrumbs (Instagram stories).
- **HRT Crisis:** The logistical nightmare of losing access to hormones, leading to grey-market smuggling and physical dysphoria.
- **Mental Health:** The struggle with Bipolar Disorder, mixed episodes, medication (Seroquel, Clonazepam), and suicidal ideation.
- **Friendship:** The "Cavalry" (Inès, Sonny, Alda) supporting the narrator, but also the strain on these relationships (e.g., Inès's frustration).
- **Professional:** The ticking clock of the thesis seminar, funding (CIHR), and immigration status.
