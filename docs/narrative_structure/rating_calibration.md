## Pattern Analysis

### Calibration Strengths
1. **Correctly identifies climactic moments:** First kiss, seizure, final goodbye, Clara's message opening all rated 5/5
2. **Appropriate use of bridge ratings:** Logistical entries consistently 2-3/5
3. **Meta-narrative awareness:** Rewards sophisticated auto-fiction treatment
4. **Arc sensitivity:** Ratings track psychological journey

### Calibration Weaknesses

**1. Conflates "psychologically fascinating" with "narratively strong"**
- Meta-text entries (2025-02-02 through 2025-02-04) rated 1-2/5 but could be 0.5-1/5 for pure narrative
- Entries with analysis get credit for insight rather than craft

**2. Over-credits introspective/static entries**
- Multiple entries that are primarily internal monologue rated 3.5/5 when they could be 2.5-3/5
- "Processing" mistaken for "narrative"

**3. Undersells structural/literary technique**
- Foreshadowing (2024-11-16) and symbolic motifs (2025-02-08 receipt) rated lower than thematic importance warrants

**4. Inconsistent treatment of surveillance/obsession**
- Same behaviors rated 2-4.5/5 depending on whether self-analysis included
- No clear criteria for distinguishing repetitive checking from compelling obsession

**5. Undervalues entries with narrator agency**
- Entries where narrator takes concrete action (unfollowing, posting the poem, reciprocal gazing) sometimes underrated vs. passive crisis entries

**6. Slight inflation on 4/5 ratings**
- Many entries rated 4/5 could be 3.5/5 (missing "vivid dramatic scenes")

---

## Recommendation

**Approach:** Do NOT modify individual analysis files. The ratings are defensible and within reasonable interpretive variance. The "inconsistencies" reflect different editorial priorities (emotional intensity vs. craft vs. plot movement) rather than errors.

**Action:**
1. Accept preliminary ratings as-is for manuscript curation
2. Use this report as a secondary filter when selecting entries
3. For final manuscript assembly, prioritize:
   - Entries where suggested rating = preliminary rating (high confidence)
   - Entries flagged as under-rated (may be overlooked gems)
   - Be skeptical of 4/5 entries that are primarily introspective
