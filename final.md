I lost count of the times I have opened Claraâ€™s profile with the quiet intention of unfollowing her. Each time, my finger hovered. An unclaimed hope always held my hand. There was no hope left that could stop me.

Her orange-tinted portrait glowed, its halo echoing in colour: whatever lay behind it was open for the world to see.

For weeks I forced myself to skip her stories. When incapable, I sneaked in anonymously. Tonight, with a loud intention, I picked her, not the unfollow button.

I was led to a still of a starry night. The subject among the constellations was a single streak of white, fleeting like her goodbyes. Below, a single sentence in matching white: there you are.

Any other night, I would have listened to the instinct that forbade me to imagine myself as the addressee of her open message. It is about a meaningful someone from her past, the voice within me argued. Or a new somebody she just met. I did listen, but this time I whispered back. Maybe. Maybe it was meant for nobody. Or maybe not.

I smiled and I closed the app. The silence in the room matched my own. For the first time I could remember, I did not take my phone with me to bed. I had nothing else to check the next morning. I turned off the lights. I fell asleep as my head touched the pillow.
