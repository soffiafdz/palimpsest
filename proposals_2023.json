        ],
        "analysis": "This event groups the afternoon-to-evening buildup of the first Alexia date: pre-date anxiety at the lab, the Italian café meeting, waiting through French class, and the metro confusion. The generic 'At The Neuro' only captures the first scene's location. The event's narrative arc is the tension between linguistic anxiety and romantic anticipation—the test being passed is not comprehension, but connection.",
        "proposed_name": "The French Test",
        "rationale": "Captures the dual meaning: Sofia's fear of failing to understand/be understood in French, and the successful first date that tests whether connection can happen across language anxiety. Ties directly to the entry's central question: 'What if I were not able to understand her?' The name is evocative and thematically resonant with the summary and themes already identified in the metadata."

          "The Night Together"
        ],
        "analysis": "This is the core Alexia night, from meeting at the metro through the night together. The name 'Je T' is truncated—likely 'Je t'ai pas dit; je suis trans,' the pivotal disclosure moment. The event spans the entire arc: recognition, bar conversation, arm-linking, the bench disclosure, counted kisses, walking home, and sex. This is the essential romantic encounter.",
        "proposed_name": "Je T'ai Pas Dit",
        "rationale": "Uses the actual disclosure phrase (complete, not truncated) as the event name. The moment on the bench—'Je t'ai pas dit; je suis trans'—is the narrative hinge of the night. Using the French phrase preserves the linguistic intimacy that defines the encounter, and 'I didn't tell you' carries the weight of disclosure, vulnerability, and the relief of being seen. This is cinematically and emotionally precise."

        "analysis": "This event covers the morning after: waking touches, the 'je peux te voire encore' misunderstanding, three goodbye kisses, and the anxious screenshot-taking afterward. The truncated 'The Narrator Didn' appears to reference Sofia not finishing during sex (mentioned in the journal: 'I did not finish. It did not matter.'). But the event's actual scenes are about the aftermath, not the sex itself.",
        "proposed_name": "Morning After Departure",
        "rationale": "Focuses on the tender morning-after scenes and the goodbye that marks Alexia's imminent departure. The phrase captures both the intimacy (morning touches, goodbye kisses) and the inevitable ending (departure). It avoids the truncation problem and provides narrative clarity about what this event actually contains."

        "analysis": "A single-scene flashback to the failed date with Sophia at Café Santropol and walking the mountain. The condescending remark triggers a switch—'nothing will come of this one.' It's narrated here as contrast to the Alexia success, but the actual date happened June 19th. Generic location naming.",
        "proposed_name": "The Switch Flipped",
        "rationale": "Captures the pivotal moment when Sofia's interest turns off like a switch after Sophia's condescending remark. The phrase comes directly from the journal: 'Like a switch, I turned off and realized nothing would come out of the experience.' It's specific to this encounter and evocative of the sudden emotional shutdown. This distinguishes it from other failed dates."

        "proposed_name": "Coffee Becomes Weekend",
        "rationale": "Simple, descriptive name that captures the expansion from brief meetup to extended time together. Sets up the subsequent events (surgery discussions, clocking anxiety, etc.) by marking the shift in plans. Straightforward and functional."

The generic 'At Old Port' misses the narrative weight: confronting surgical possibilities and deepening ambivalence.",
        "proposed_name": "After Seeing Her Vulva",
        "rationale": "Uses the journal's own stark phrasing: 'After seeing Cynthia's brand-new vulva, I knew even less.' This event is fundamentally about surgical confrontation—seeing the results, hearing the details, being asked directly if she wants it, and finding certainty harder rather than easier. The name is visceral, specific, and captures the core of this encounter."

Generic location naming. The scenes connect through attraction and the hovering subject of transness that never lands.",
        "proposed_name": "Attraction and Avoidance",
        "rationale": "Captures both threads running through these scenes: Sofia's simultaneous attraction to the waitress and to the married couple, and the pattern of near-disclosure with Alda that hovers without landing. The event is about desire and the unsaid—both the crushes that surface and the trans conversation that doesn't happen."

        "analysis": "Single scene: texting the new roommate about move-in dates, crystallizing the resolution to move out without disclosing to Alda. The date-in-parentheses format is problematic. This is the emotional climax of the entry—the weight of the unsaid made concrete.",
        "proposed_name": "Without Ever Telling Her",
        "rationale": "Uses the journal's exact phrase: 'I will probably end up moving out without ever telling her about me.' This is the entry's emotional conclusion—the decision to leave without disclosure. The name captures the resignation and sadness of that choice. Direct, emotionally precise, and avoids the date-parentheses format."

Generic 'At Los Angeles' only references the flight search scene.",
        "proposed_name": "The Booth and the Daydream",
        "rationale": "Captures the two emotional poles of this event: the isolating experience at the queer happy hour (sitting in the booth watching others connect) and the excited flight-search daydreaming about Monica's visit. The contrast between present disappointment and future hope structures these scenes."

Generic location naming. The event's core is the void—months without writing, conference networking anxiety like the lonely girls at the happy hour, and the medication consideration loop.",
        "proposed_name": "Empty Inside",
        "rationale": "Uses the journal's direct confession: 'Am I feeling better? For months, I have not written anything. I feel empty inside; both my body and my mind.' This is the entry's emotional center—the confrontation with emptiness, the writing gap, the medication loop, the loneliness parallel. Stark and emotionally accurate."
