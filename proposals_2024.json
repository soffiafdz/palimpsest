The narrator stays with a friend, navigates constant misgendering while presenting femininely but in \"masculine\" clothes, and has three charged encounters with a woman from their LGBTQ+ group days. The central tension: an almost-romance that never consummates in a kiss. They hold hands, sit intimately at a hidden fountain, gaze into each other's eyes at an intersection—but neither initiates. The entry opens with the devastating epigraph: *\"¿Me vas a dejar irme otra vez sin besarme?\"* (Are you going to let me leave again without kissing me?). Other events include: getting two tattoos (a phoenix and a plant branch), an in-person therapy session where the narrator confesses thoughts of detransitioning, a bar night where they almost kiss another woman, and a final reunion with Nymeria at home.",
