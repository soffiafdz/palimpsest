I should sleep right now.

Tomorrow morning, just breaking dawn,
I'll have to rise before everyone and shower.
We will go to Ensenada for the meeting.

It'll be the third time Catherine and I go there.
The first time was when Juan Carlos invited us to seeing him in a presentation
of his doctorate investigation.

That was the first time we went somewhere just the two of us.
We didn't remember it, but it was our first day out just the two of us.
She has a picture of us, sitting on the bus.
We look young and innocent, so naïve.
Neither of us ever imagined what our future would look like.
It was just by the end of our second year of college—or was it the first?
No, it was before Anahi dropped out.

What we thought was our first day out was when we went to the _Corre con Color_ race.
That was the following semester—the beginning of our third year—when we took
the elective Psychology of the Masses.
It would be awkward, we both feared it.
We were nervous.
Maybe we forgot about that first day out of the city.

We have traveled before.
Alone and together.
We have flought by plane and explored a city.
Now it's just a conference.

My bag is almost ready.
I finished my book and I won't start the new one yet.
I'll maybe take the Game Boy with me.
She has the newer one.
I lent it to her.
She has passed all of the levels in Super Mario.
Today I started playing Pokémon for the first time since Spain.
I've tought about deleting the thirty-three-hour gameplay and starting a new
one.

---

I'm a child.
We have just moved.
Recently we have been coming, little by little, to habitate this new house.
By now it has several furniture,
but its smell is still of something new and artificial.

It's our new house but it's not a home yet.
My father is in what will be my parents' bedroom.
He's shirtless and doing housework.

Am I helping him? No.
My brother hasn't been born yet.
Luis will be his name but I don't know it yet.
I don't know either how close we will be 12 years later.

That's not even my age.
I will be 11 years old when he's born.

I am in elementary school.
We don't live here yet.
I look out the window and see a van parked
in front of the house crossing the street.

Will they be our neighbors?
Will we play with those children?

We will.
Their names are Cristian, Marco and Karina.
The oldest is two years younger than me and the younger boy is the same age
as Miguel.

---

It's my birthday.
They have come to congratulate me.
Cristian sings the happy birthday song in French.

Did I just turn 11?
Margarita is the name of our neighbor next door.
She gives me a climbing toy that I mounted on the door of my bedroom.
By the time I leave this house to go to Spain
I'll have had been in every bedroom but my parents'.

There is something about Cristian.
There is Something weird about me, too.

In the future, my mother will tell me something I should have not known.

---

I am at the Ovies' house.
We go downstairs and their mother, Adriana, is crying.

"Why are you crying, mom?" Cristian asks.

"Because I love you very much and I was just talking about it."

I'm not a teenager yet, but I can sense when something is not being said.

My mother will later confirm my suspicions.

---

Adriana and my mother are talking in our front door.
They think I'm not listening.

It happens a lot, a lot of things are said in front of me and I hear them
despite them not being said for me.

"He's not gay.
The psychologist already told us.
She asked him if he liked girls and a lot of questions.
She told us, he's not gay."

---

My mother is seated in our table.
The lights are dimmed and I don't know why we're alone.

She'll tell me now.
I don't fully comprehend the seriousness of what she's saying.

She starts talking about that same story of her cousin.
A _girl trapped in a boy's body_.
He role-played as wonder-woman whenever they played together.
He died, one day he was run over by a truck.
She never knew what would have been of his life;
whether he would've transitioned;
if the family would've been supportive.

What does it have to do with everything?
She thinks Cristian is just like her cousin.

Cristian was raped as a child, she's telling me out of nowhere.
Karina, as well.
Marco was the only of the three who wasn't.
That's the story Adriana was telling that made her cry.

The Ovies will move months or years later.
I'll miss them, but end up forgetting about them.

Cristian will turn into a normal college guy according to what I'll see on
the internet.

He wasn't gay and probably won't ever be.

---

"Men don't do that. You are not a man."
I told him once in some other words and with some other intentions.
Did I want to hurt him? My mom hadn't told me yet. I had no idea.

He gave me the finger and left.

It was later that I knew things I shouldn't.

We kept being friends until their departure.

I ended up being the one who was not a man.

Did I know yet I wouldn't be?
Did I suspect anything of what would happen?

I doubt it.

I was a child who knew too much but felt too little.
