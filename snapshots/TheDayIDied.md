"This is the last day of your life.
Today you will die.
You have 15 minutes left to live."

I was half-awake when the doorknob turned and the door cringed.

Who could that be?
The house should be empty.
No one is here.

Is someone in?
Has somebody entered?

Luis started talking.
He asked a question about computers.
I answered and we kept talking.
He repeated the same cookie monster joke about having no cookies and having no friends.
I recorded him and sent the videos to Catherine and Monica.

I was already talking to both of them.
It felt nice again to have my girlfriend and my best friend back.

Now everything changed, though.
My bestfriend became my girlfriend.
My girlfriend is now just my friend.
I was a boy and now I am _happy_.

He lied in bed with me and told me how I was adopted.
We both laughed.

Later I made breakfast for the both of us.

I was in the shower and, when I finished, I did my hair.

Monica said something about how I lasted a lot in there.

I sent a pic of me with my hair tied.

She said I looked bad.
I was hideous.

She repeated it again and again as a joke.

I didn't get sad.

I cleaned myself, let my hair down, and took another picture.

This one I knew I looked good.
I liked it.
I really did.
I sent it to both of them.

"Ash. You look girly. I mean, pretty. Well girly, too."

I was supposed to fill out the papers about death.
I want to be cremated.
I want my organs to be donated.
I want a small service with just intimate people.

A lot of people get sensitive with these topics.
I never understood about that.
I am scared of death but I can talk about it, think about it.

Catherine came and parked in front of my house.

She picked a shirt for tomorrow from all the white ones that were lying on my bed.
She took it and we would leave.

I went up to say goodbye to my brother and stayed there helping him with the second screen.

I left and we went to school.

We have now the paper slip that liberates us from Social Service.

I am seated in class.

Again I ended up alone.
I annexed myself to another pair and we worked.
I played two roles and shared how I felt and what I thought.

Now I have my eyes closed.
I am breathing and all my body is relaxed.

I am inside a train station.
There is a smart car outside, but I choose to enter.
I like trains, they bring me good memories.

I enter and get in the wagon.
Nobody is here.

I am just carrying my gray backpack.
This is a journey but I don't know where I am going.
The doors close.
A voice from the speakers calls for the next station.

The train goes inside a tunnel and everything is pitch black.

I am not here anymore.

I am inside somewhere.
Everything is dark, too, but I am not afraid.
I am drowned in water but I feel comfortable and warm.
There is a light and it scares me.
It's unkown, there are sounds and shapes and colors.
I feel cold and the piercing lights scare me.
I feel pain and stabs.
I cry, I scream.
I am born.

My body is a mistake, but I don't know it yet.

I am back in the train and I feel sad.
I see my own body and try to forget about it.
The next station is close.
The doors open again.

I am dressed in my uniform as a small boy.
I have a heavy bag on my back and a typing machine on my hand.
I feel alone.
I am alone.
It's ok, I don't mind it.

I am seated on the stairs outside the PC lab.
The teacher Mayra is talking to me about the sheet of paper I turned in.
I wrote in it how I sometimes feel alone and that I don't have a lot of friends.

This is an exercise she's making because of Andrés.
I don't know it and never will be sure, but he confessed to her how he's depressed and has given thought to killing himself.

She's worried about me and I'm surprised.
Why should she be worried?
I am ok.
Sure, I am alone, but I don't mind it.

I don't know yet that something is wrong with me.

I am back in the train.
I know what stop is coming next and I am scared.
My arm starts trembling.
I have to get off.

I am in highschool.
I have a hint of what could be going on with me, but I pretend I don't know.
My hair is long and I have lost a lot of weight.
Somebody loves me but I hate myself.

I want to die.
I am in pain.
I have no place in this world.
Everything is not black, but a muddy gray.
There is not necessarily darkness, but everything is a little darkened.
There is no emotion, no life around me.
I am numb and passive.

I am in my bed crying.
I am in my car crying.
I am walking to school crying.

I have friends and a girlfriend and I feel more lonely than ever.

My body is trembling and my eyes are full of tears and pain.
My respiration is agitated and violent.

I run towards the station.
I hate it here.

I think about what the next station is going to be,
but we stop somewhere first.

I am in the present.
Catherine is by my side.
I am not sad anymore.
I have met happiness and have met life.
I am not alone.
I have friends.
People that love me.
I opened to them and to my family.

Everyone has told me how they're here for me.
For the first time in my life, I believe it.

The pain is gone, the sadness is gone.
I think about the future and my plans.
I think about how I can be myself, start letting people know me,
and actually live.
I am excited about the future.
I want to get back to the train and think about all the journey that is left.

Except there is no station anymore.
I am in front of a table.
There is a chest with something in there for me.
I don't know what's inside, but I don't want it.
I have things to do, things to feel, things to live.

I open it and there is a note in there.
It is addressed to me.
I start to read it.
I hear its content in Zayra's voice.

My life is over.

I am scared.
It can't be.

It's not fair, it's not fucking fair.

20 years living a mistake and now that I found myself everything will end before I was let to be born and be me.

I am in so much pain I feel the tears rolling and escaping my closed eyelids.

I fall down when I hear I have just 15 minutes left.
I don't think of anyone or anything.
In my mind there is just pain, a profound and heavy pain that leaves me immobile.

It's my fault.
I should had made something I should had lived.
I should had known and opened myself.

Now it's too late.

I open my eyes and I am back in the classroom.
In front of me, I see a piece of paper asking me for my epitaph.
Still with tears in my eyes, I grab the pencil and start to write.

_Her life ended just when she was starting to live it_.

We take turns to talk about the activity and our experience.
I listen and, when my turn comes, I talk.
I cry in front of my classmates.
Zayra listens and tries to help.

_It's not fair to blame a little child; he did what he could._

I am an adult now and I can fix it.
I can look for a solution, she continues.
I should change what I can.
Remember this and live by it.

She thanks me for opening up, for sharing.
She knows how difficult it is for me.
She mentions the biography I sent her and everything I've been through.

Did I put in there my biggest problem?
Could I show myself to her?

Melissa gets angry with my words.

"It's not that I am angry with you." She starts.

"I saw a Melissa talking.
I saw myself in you, in your pain."

She's in so much pain.
She's hiding it, too.
She's been on it for so many years.

I know what that is.

She asks us to not look at her.
She doesn't want to cry.

She is in pain and the air is escaping her.

She vomits everything she's dealing with at us.
Without censorship she talks and talks and let everything out.
Everyone is moved and sad.
There are people crying.

Zayra's voice breaks the moment as she intervenes.
There is the question.

"Melissa, have you thought about ending everything?"

She wants to escape and go outside, but she stays.

She lets herself be helped.
Some friends take turns talking to her.

I talk to her but I feel I made a mistake somehow.

Karen will talk later about herself, too.
She's been diagnosed with major depressive disorder since she was seven.

She cries, too, and I see them both.
I am like them.

No, I was.

_He_ was.

He was a little boy that did everything he could with a problem
that was more than he could handle.
More than most could.

I am not alone anymore and I'll be sure of it when Zayra hugs me
and whispers his name in my ear;
when Catherine will talk to me about what she saw,
what she thought and how she felt.

"_I was with her, I picked her up and spent the day with her._
Then I remembered we didn't kiss.
When I heard I had 15 minutes left,
I just thought how I didn't get to kiss you."

One sentence marked my death and another should mark my life.

_My life initiated just when I started living it._
