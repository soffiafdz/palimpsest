"Sofía here, I made it home in one piece.

"...two pieces."

---

French has been insufferable.

I haven't been feeling well.
These past two weeks have been probably the lowest I've felt in months.
I haven't gone to the office a single day since Louis' departure on vacations
two weeks ago.
I haven't gone out of the house too much, either.

I should have cut my nails yesterday, but I didn't.
I don't know why exactly, but I feel a strong urge to pause this to do it right
now.

Some time last week I met with Chloé.
We went to Café Velours.
I got there first and waited for her with my latte on the lower floor.
It was empty when I got there, except for a woman playing with her little girl.
After our date ended, I walked her back to the metro station.
Like the date with Marie-Anne before her,
we exchanged instagram accounts to stay in touch.
I haven't heard from Chloé nor sent her anything myself.
I don't think I will.

I got a text from Bea half an hour after the midnight between Friday and Saturday.
"Hey, any chance you're free tomorrow or Sunday?"

The next day I was meeting Valerie at _Oui mais non_, but we could meet in the
evening.
My Sunday, on the other hand, was all free.
She told me that we would have to meet in her neighborhood in NDG, since she
was dogsitting.
We agreed to meet at _Typhoon lounge_ at 18h30, that same Saturday..

In the morning I got ready with the possibility in mind that I might head out
towards NDG directly after my platonic coffee date with Valerie.
I put make up on.
It was not evident that for the whole week before that day,
I had not been able to take a shower, much less leave my apartment.

Aliza texted me asking me how I was doing. I did not lie.
I replied with an old meme confessing I was going through a bit of a depression.
She told me she was making plans with Liana and I was welcome to join them.
Later she would send me the details about them going for lunch at
_Les Brasseurs de Montréal_ the next day.

Inside the café, I was waiting for Valerie to return from the restroom when I saw the message from Bea cancelling our plans for the evening.
The dog she was taking care of had just thrown up and she would need to stay
to take care of him.

"I promise I did want to see you,
he's just a very old dog and it's too much for today,"
she sent almost 20 minutes after that first message,
while I was finishing off with Valerie.

When I dropped Valerie off at the organic supermarket,
she told me to let her know if I wanted to go see Monkey man with her during
the week.
We said our good-byes.

I continued walking towards my apartment a couple of blocks ahead.
During the second half of the walk home,
I replied to Bea telling her I understood and to let me know if she wanted to
reschedule.
She thanked me for being so understanding and apologized again.

"Really, don't sweat it. Hope the ol' doggo is doing better."

I went to bed and woke up Sunday with the full weight of life pushing me down.
I hadn't gotten out of bed by 12h45 when I texted Aliza to let her know I was
not coming to lunch.
She understood and asked me if I needed anything.

Later in the day Alda made me remember that we had postponed our meeting last
week with Vero for the next weekend.
She wasn't feeling like going, but was not comfortable with the idea of
cancelling on her again.
I told her I could do it this time.
I didn't have to lie.
I wrote that I was feeling a bit down and would love if we could meet
another time instead.

Bea had texted me in the morning while I was still cuddling my depression.
Her text said that the dog seemed much better and it was just probably the
nerves of being abandoned in a new and strange place.
He was going home that afternoon so he would be OK.
She signed her message by stating she would love to reschedule.
She'd be available that same evening, Monday or Wednesday.

I don't remember if I was still in bed or if I had gotten up when
I replied to her using the plans with Vero that I had just cancelled
as my excuse if why I could not see her that dreaded Sunday.
Just like last time, my French classes would also make it impossible to
meet her the other proposed days.

"I do wanna reschedule, so don't think I'm bailing," I justified myself,
"but it would have to be Thursday or later in the week."

We came back to the same _impasse_ we had been the week before.

_Maybe next week?_

"Yeah, just don't be a stranger," I pled her.
"Who knows, I'll let you know if I feel like skipping one of the classes."

I didn't go outside again. To this day I haven't done laundry.

I had my session with Fabiola on Tuesday.
It has been the second session on which I talked more about my depression.
She proposed to do a meditation exercise, but I got frustrated when I couldn't
visualize anything of she was asking me to.

She ended the session imploring me to go outside some times,
to take walks and let myself be touched by the Sun.

That same afternoon, after my session, I went to meet with Alda at _Tabac_.
I told her how I had gotten frustrated the evening before in French class
when we were instructed to do, again, that boring activity about the
text of Hubert Reeves.
It would have been the third time with that same text.
I spoke up about it and we moved to do another activity.
Still, the professor wanted to go back to it and correct it.
I decided right then and there that I would skip Wednesday's class.

I texted Bea Tuesday's afternoon, after coming back from Tabac.
I asked her if she was still down to meet on Wednesay.

"Sure! You skippin class?"

I shared with her my frustrations without going into much detail.

"I'll try to say some things in French to you to make up for it," she added.

"You're both pretty and smart."

We continued subtly flirting in the next round of texts on which we settled
the details.
I proposed going to the same place we were supposed to meet last weekend.
Did I pick it on purpose since I knew it would be close to her house?

Since we started texting, our conversations flowed with the implication that
we were going to hook up. _Want to get a drink or something?_
Still, I did not take it for granted. That Wednesday I did not get ready
with the expectations of having sex that night—I
did wear the nicest bra I own, though.

I don't remember what I did that morning.

Last minute, I consciously decided not to put on make up.

I left with enough time to make two stops on the way.
The first one was at _Baristello_ to buy a bag of coffee beans.
Then, I passed the entrance to the metro station and went a couple of blocks
ahead to the pharmacy.
I picked up my prescription for hormones and anti-androgens.

Despite my chores, I got to station Villa-Maria with plenty of time to spare.
I had two options.
I could get to the bar first and find somewhere to sit—maybe order
a beer and some fries—and calm down my nerves before Bea would arrive.
Instead, I went with the other option.
I stayed in a corner of the metro station killing the extra time on my phone.

The walk to the bar through Monkland was around 10 minutes.
Around halfway to my destination I would start turning back half-expecting
to recognize someone.

I didn't.

I walked by the entrance of the bar without realizing it.
I turned back and hesitated before stepping in.
There were no notifications in my phone screen.

I entered through the door expecting the bar to be full and having to dive
into the chatter of many people sitting at the tables in order to find an
empty one where I could sit down and wait for my date.

I was wrong. The bar was almost empty.
I looked around and saw a couple of men sitting on the corner.
Then, I noticed the bartenders behind the bar full of empty stools.
Straight ahead and to the left, on the very end,
was a woman sitting down on a booth and looking down to the spot on the table
where her pint of cider was sitting in front of her.
I did not recognize her and at the same time I was sure that it was Bea.
I took the first step towards her.

Eventually, she looked up and recognized me.

"You haven't been here long, have you?"

It had not been long, she said, with her pint in front of her as evidence of
her white lie. She was just about to text me she was inside.

I told her I had left my house with plenty of time to spare and thus walked
really slowly coming there from the metro.

She had gotten before me on purpose, she confessed, she wanted to sit down
and calm herself down.

I could relate, I told her, thinking about the time I went to N, two months
ago.

I told her how, lately, I've been preferring being the second person to arrive.
For some reason I have been getting anxious about the idea of getting
somewhere and not finding an available place to sit.
It's selfish, but I've preferred to let the other person...

### Friday, April 26th, 2024
...we started our date by talking about our first date anxieties.

The day before when we were scheduling our date, I told her how,
since I was skipping responsabilities already,
I might as well use my morning to get some work done and actually go to the
office.

"Hahah look at you, professional queen!"
starts the last text in our tinder conversation,
in which she tells me 18h is perfect since she had an editing job she needed
to finish.

I confessed that I did in fact not go the office.
I left out how I haven't done any actual work at all the past couple of weeks.

We talked about our jobs.
Myself going from psychology to working with addiction research in
my master's in Mexico City, and finally coming to work with Alzheimer's in
Montréal.
She asked me questions about the particularities of Alzheimer's disease
diagnosis and the role of the brain plaques in it.
She also asked me about memory and the hippocampus.
She told me about studying English in college, living in Halifax,
then Vancouver and Toronto before coming back to Montréal just last year.
Her work as a proofreader for a feminist publisher in Toronto.
She is now a freelancer editor.

When we talked about me skipping French class after the latest frustrations,
she reminded me that she could introduce herself in Spanish.

"_Me llamo Bea y bebo una pinta de sidra._"

I was midway through my pint of Guinnes,
when the waiter came to pick her empty glass.
She ordered a second one.

The conversation flowed unlike most of the other dates before her.
We shared our experiences in Portugal and Spain.
We talked about aphantasia and my lack of internal monologue.
We talked about religion and the feelings of nausea triggered by either
the eventual absence of existence (my case) or the vastness of the universe
around us (hers).

The waiter came a third time to pick up our glasses and asked us if we
wanted something else.
I broke her hesitation by saying I would if she did.
We both ordered one more.

Until the last minute our conversation never withered.

"I am going outside to smoke," she said placing the words on the table where
her box of cigarettes used to be. "Do you want to come with me?"

She grabbed and put on her coat.
She then placed one of the plastic menus on top of both of our glasses.
In turn, I grabbed my jacket and walked behind her towards the exit.

The sun had set already; we had only the night as company.
It was colder outside than when I first had gotten in.
I put my hands inside my jacket pockets hoping to keep the warmth in.
I tried—but failed—to contain my shivering;
she made no mention of it if she noticed it.

We continued talking between her puffs.

She put down her left hand holding her cigarette.
In a swift move, she shifted the weight from her right leg to the left one
and looked up to meet my eyes that were already set on her.

"Can I kiss you?"

Instead of answering, I walked towards her and placed one hand on her waist
and the other one on her arm.
Her free hand went to my lower back in response.

We kissed.

We kissed a thousand times as if no one were watching.
Here and then we would pause to smile and reposition our hands.
We didn't open our eyes nor wandered too far apart of each other.

Her mouth tasted like tobacco, honey, and promises.
There was something in her that made me want to confess to her all my secrets.

"I live 5 minutes away," she whispered without letting me go and barely looking
up. "Do you want to come home with me?"

She made a comment about littering as she went to dispose her cigarette to the
thrash can.
She grabbed my hand and walked me back inside to our table.

Our glasses were half-full waiting for us.
She asked me if I wanted to stay and finished them.
Her promised-flavoured lips were still calling my name.
Half of a pint seemed eternal.

I ordered the bills.

She went to the restroom and I paid for mine.
When she came back, I took my turn to relieve myself.
She paid while I was away.

We put back our coats.
This time she made a comment about her wonder of how I was bearing
the chill winds only with my thin spring denim jacket.

This time, we did not hold hands while I walked behind her.

After the promised 5 minutes, we got to her apartment.
She opened the door and let me into her world.

We took off our shoes.
We took off our jackets.
After her, following her example, I placed mine on the coat rack.

Did we start kissing again there or did she lead me to her bedroom first?

She was the first to lie down on the bed.
I kneeled over her and continued our silent conversation.

After just a couple of minutes, I stopped.

"Hey, I am 90 percent sure I already told you. You do know I am trans, right?"

"Yeah," she smiled.
"Don't worry about it; I like girls."

It wasn't long before she prompted a second interruption.

"Do you have a condom? I don't."

I thought back to that evening and realized the thought never crossed my mind.

Two years ago when I came back from my holiday obsessed with the promises of
Kate, I had gone to the pharmacy and bought a box of condoms.
She had already left my life the night when I took one and tested whether I
could put one on myselft for the first time after starting hormones.

"I don't," I started answering, "but...
have you been with other trans people?...
It doesn't...",
my head went back to a couple of weeks after that memory trying a condom alone
in my room. I had hooked up with Amanda. We were on that same bed, and,
despite being able to hold an erection enough to put the condom one,
it was not enough to have penetration.

She answered me in affirmation, implying she had been.
There was something in the way she responded that made me think not only
how I was not the first, but that there had probably been several before me.

"It... it doesn't work like that anymore."
Had other girls' before?

We moved up from the bottom of the bed towards where her pillows were.

She grabbed the bottom edge of my long-sleeved blue top and pulled it up
from my head.
I did the same thing back leaving her in her teal bra.
She tried taking mine off but started struggling with the hooks.
I offered her some help with it.

"It's really pretty, but we don't need it right now."

We were both completely bare from the waist up when it happened.

We were repositioning ourselves in the middle of our kisses when her teeth
bumped into mine and I heard—or felt—a crack.
I instinctively pulled away and felt a tiny peeble between my lips.

"I think you broke my tooth."

She covered her own face with her hands as if it were her teeth that might
possibly fall off her mouth.

I started laughing nervously as I remembered how almost 7 years ago I was
panicking in front of the mirror with the taste of blood on my swollen lips.
I knew exactly what had happened, but I still felt the urge to get out of
the bed in the search of a mirror to check on myself.
I decided that the best idea was not to look at me.

She was mortified.
She kept asking me if I was OK.

"You know what, don't worry about it," I reassured her.
"I can worry about this in the next couple of hours."

My calmness seemed to be contagious.
We continued exploring our bodies.

"Do you like people sucking your dick?"

I hesitated.
I tried to hide the thoughts coming back to my mind of a couple of weeks ago
when I met with Jay and, talking about the boundaries of hooking up, I answered
that same question to her by saying that I could _tolerate it_.
It's not that I don't like it.
I feel insecure about its smell and taste.
There's the inherent maleness of it that makes me think of it as something
_disgusting_.

Instead, to Bea, I only nodded.

She went down on me.
She pulled down my pants together with my underwear.
Her mouth was electric.
I bit my lower lip and discovered the new sharpness of my front tooth.
I looked down over my breasts towards her head moving up and down.
I put my fingers inside her brown hair being careful not to push her.

I wanted her to finish and come back up to me.
I wanted to kiss her mouth hoping I could lick my own taste from her
lips and give a rest to my worrying mind realizing it was not as
disgusting as it was in my head.

When she returned, instead of man, she tasted of acid and salt.
I continued kissing her desperately trying to make her mouth forget the taste
of my genitals.

I moved down through her body.
I first kissed her neck and she moaned softly in response,
a whisper of desire barely escaping into the air.
I licked the space between her breasts.
I embraced her left nipple between my two lips and pushed down.
I tried to suck on it, but she jerked when I accidently grazed it with the
edge of my broken tooth.

I continued traversing her body with kisses all the way from her chest to
her pubic hair.
Instead of getting to the destination,
I intentionally wandered on the edges of her vulva and the inside of her thighs.
Her breathing accelerated.
I started hearing her whimpers.
I caught a glimpse of the tattoo in her leg,
which without my glassess it was just a blur.

I don't think I made her cum.
I went up to kiss her anyway.
On the way back I saw her second tatoo in her arm.
We continued kissing, turning around naked over her sheets,
rubbing our thighs like twigs used to start a fire.

"I want to make you cum, Sofia", she whispered as her hand was jerking my dick.

I touched her in reciprocation.
Her dryness made me worry I was not doing a good job at it.
As if she could read my thoughts, she tried to ease my mind by letting me
know she had some toys we could use.

Her focus was completely set on me; on trying to make me orgasm.

I did not.

I thought proposing her to grab one of her toys and moving on to her,
but I swallowed the idea and just held her closer.
We stayed there in the arms of each other.

I asked her about the tattoo.
She described it to me, in detail.
She told me how it's a lighthouse in honour of Virginia Woolf's novel.
There is a phrase under the lighthouse talking about corridors that I
have unfortunately forgotten.
Uptop, there is the phrase _we remain_.

Her arm holds the silhouette of the islands from where her mother is.
She told me the initimate stories of the island.
She narrated the memories she has in there about exploring the fields with her
father and swimming in the lake with her friends.

I held her in my arms as her head was lying on top of my right breast.
As she was talking, I could feel her voice caressing my chest.
It was as if she were talking directly to my heart,
every whisper warm and affectionate.

She asked me about my pictures.
We talked about how I started, how it was a suggestion from my therapist.
I told her how I got into film photography.
How I feel uncomfortable by the invasiveness of street photography,
which is accentuated by the vulnerability I feel whenever someone sees me taking pictures.

"You should take me with you once."

I heard her well.
I still was convinced that I must had misunderstood her.

"You should let me come with you once when you're taking pictures.
I would also love if you take a picture of me."

She told me about her old roommate who had a made-up dark room inside a
closet and who had taken the single film picture she has of herself.

I  would definitely love taking a picture of her. I let her know.

I looked at my watch even though I did not care about the hour.
Nothing did I want more than staying in her bed feeling the warmth of her naked
skin for the rest of the night.
I told her that I should be leaving soon.

We talked about the night.
I confessed I was not expecting it would end like this.
She let me know she had hidden some of her medications—despite then now feeling
she didn't have to—and even made the bed for me.
I should be flattered, she finished.

I told her, in the end, how I was glad that I did not go meet her with the idea
that there was the possibility of coming back home with her,
since that would had made me more anxious.

She told me I turned out to be cooler than she was expecting.

She went outside the world we built that night for ourselves in her bedroom
for water.
While she was far away in her kitchen, I put on my underwear.

"So, was it worth it?" she joked about my tooth.

I laughed and said it was still too soon to joke about it.
The loose piece was on her night stand.
She teased me asking if I wanted to take it with me or leave it.
I said that she could keep it and hold it next to the picture I would take
of her.

We started picking up our clothes and putting them on.
I thought about the poem of Cortazar, _Amor 77_, but made no mention of it.
She put on her pijamas and walked me outside the bedroom.

I complimented the artwork that was framed on her walls.
She made a comment about how all the art in her place is from people she knows.

Would she one day hang up the portrait that she asked me to take of her?

Did she mean it or was the request nothing but an empty promise
like the ones people make when they're cuddling without clothes and
full of hormones and romance?

I took my jacket from the hook.

"Please text me when you get home. I worry," she implored.

"Sure," I assured her. "Do you want to move outside the app?"

She looked at me and I notice doubts shinning from her grayish blue eyes.
She took my phone and put her number in anyway.

I walked towards the door after having put my shoes on.
She grabbed both of my hands and we kissed again, one last time,
as a way to close the night.

I closed the door behind me and walked alone towards the metro in the cold
night.

---

Now, I'm sitting down at a table in Café Velours a couple of blocks away from
my apartment.

This morning I made an appointment at the dentist.

My smile is no longer broken.
