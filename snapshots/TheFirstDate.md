"I had a very nice afternoon today!
I really liked you [...]
I'd love to see you again, let me know if you feel the same way."

"I do! I do feel the same way! [...]
No, really; thought you were so delightful!"

I am back from the date with Kate. She seemed interested from the get go, she was the one who sent the first message, she agreed very quickly to going out. The weather didn't discourage her.
Even though she took a while to reply back to my first message, she was always cheerful and into the conversation.

The date kept going—just like Flore's—after the meal. The conversation was flowing. We laughed. I had a good time and from her body language I sensed that she was having one, too. She mentioned going home and looked for the closest metro station. When we got there, she was surprised that I would be walking back home. Moments before she had made a comment that she couldn't google me because she didn't have my last name. Maybe when I would give her my instagram, she could look me up. So, after she made the too familiar speech about having a good time and letting her know if I wanted to do it again, I offered it to her.

"Do you want my instagram so you can stalk me?"

"Oh, yeah, of course. You're thinking of me, I can look you up on the train."

"Always."

Walking home, I got a message from Alda. I don't remember which one was first, her list about last night's expenses or her asking me about my date. I review all the day in my mind before replying.

I woke up at 8 am even though I had slept less than 4 hours. I told Armando about the club last night. I showered and went on my way. I got early to the metro station and decided to wait inside. I got a message from her:

"Attend, tes arrivee? Je crois que c'etait toi, lol"

She apologized for speaking in french, and then turned around and met me. We hugged clumsily. I am too much in my mind about not invading the other person's boundaries. Even if I were to ask like she did when she left, I would still worry that they were being too nice.

I thought about offering the place that Abby proposed last night, but we instead walked towards St Laurent. We decided to stay at an indian place and had lunch there. We chatted about ourselves. I'll probably forget most about what she told me. My memory hasn't been doing very well. She went to that same high school that the girl at the halloween party went to, the same one where Antonija went as well. Are they all of the same age? Probably not.

We talked about the burlesque show. She's a survivor of assault? Neurodivergent. Two sisters and a brother. This is the first time that I said I have a brother and a sister.

We walked to this cat cafe, but there was a long line. We instead walked to china town and had some bubble tea. We went towards old port and carry on the conversation. She talked about her village. Her little town, her parents' farm. Her accent was sweet, and I particularly loved how she would imitate the voice of her own mother.

Then the date ended. This time, even though everything went 'well', instead of feeling excited and wanting to share it with Monica, I started a bunch of more impersonal conversations with Alda, Anahi, I even sent a message to Paty.

I havent talked at all about last night's dance and panic when I got an erection in the middle of the dance floor grinding with this girl, or about how now I guess Alda really doesn't know I am transgender. I am not obligated to tell her. I didn't lie to her. Why does it still feel like I betrayed her?

I went to pee and saw my eyes. They're very red and irritated. I didn't wear the lenses today. Last night I didn't struggle so much to take them off, either.

I will have lots of stuff to tell Calli next appointment in a week and a half. Aliza's night, last night's dance and the envy I felt towards Abby. Today's date.

I guess a lot can still happen between today and then. We just talked today's about self-fulfilling prophecies.

When I told Alda about the date, she said it sounded really nice. It does, it was. But then again, so was Flore's and I know how that ended.
