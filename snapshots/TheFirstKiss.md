I'm typing these words outside of the 750words website.
I am aboard a plane going to Mexico City. Today, it was a good day.

Last night, Sunday, I did not complete the words.
The opportunity was there; I could have easily done them before Alda came home.
We had talked about doing something; just hanging out in the apartment, buying
some alcohol and perhaps ordering some food.

In the morning I cooked all of my eggs in the fridge, half of a dozen of them.
I separated the scrambled eggs from the pan into two halves.
One went into my bowl to eat at the moment, the rest in a tupperware to be
eaten later.
Not even 15 minutes after I finished the bowl I went back and ate
the second portion.
I felt not only full, but disgusted with myself.
Would that count as binge eating?
I felt so hungry that I couldn't stop.
I didn't want to eat anything else for the rest of the day.

Alda came and told me she didn't want to drink anything.
For once, I was actually OK with the idea of not drinking.
I didn't want to eat anything either, so we just smoked weed outside on
the balcony.

I kept looking into Armando's room and saw how his lights were on.
That was the last I had about him until he came out of his room
around 2H in the morning.

I'm actually glad I decided not to tell anything to Alda.
When we were thinking about what to watch, she proposed the second comedy
special of Dave Chappelle.
I was hesitant to the idea, not only because of the obvious awkwardness of
hearing trans jokes with her by my side, but also because it's not even funny.

There it was the perfect opportunity to ask her.
_Did you meet many transgender people when you were in New York?_ I didn't.

We ordered food and ate. Poutine. It was good.

What was not good was the feeling I got when I entered my room and saw all of
the notifications that were on my phone.
Most of them were from Armando asking us to be more quiet.
Neither of us saw his messages.
He kept sending us texts instead of coming out and saying something.

I mean, he shouldn't have to say anything in the first place.
But, I'm certain that he ended up this mad because of the idea that we were
intentionally ignoring him.

When I saw his messages, I considered actually ignoring him, too.
Instead I wrote back a short message apologizing and telling how I had not
seen his texts.

Four hours later, I woke up drenched in sweat.
I wrote him a longer one.

It's almost 24 hours later and he has not replied.
I am not totally sure what exactly I am feeling about it.
Am I upset? Guilty? Annoyed?

I got caught in a thought loop.
Over and over, I could see how I ran circles through the same couple of
thoughts.
I don't remember the last time I was that high.
Maybe with the brownie in Las Vegas. Maybe, it was...

I sent Louis a message telling him that I'd be missing the Neuro meeting
because I had an appointment with a therapist.
Whenever you mention anything concerning mental health,
people get too sensitive about it and tend to respect your privacy.
He was very understanding.
_Health is always more important than lab meetings_.

I wished Kate good luck on her test and she replied back quickly.
Close to noon, I reached out again asking if we had settled on any plans for
later.
She had just finished her test, she said. She would shower,
eat something, and head out.
By the end, at the time we were going to meet,
I could have gone to the lab meeting with plenty of time to spare.

I waited for her outside the Peel metro station sitting under the sun.
I was not wearing my coat, just the gray hoodie over a t-shirt.
She recognized me before I did.
We hugged and I gave her the options I had thought.

_I have three options,_ I had prepared of saying, _depending on what you want
to drink. If you want coffee, we can go to this authentic italian café;
If you want to drink tea, there's a cute tea house a couple blocks ahead._

In my head I would hold off a third option, only to say it were she to ask
for it.

_Do I really need to say it? That's if you don't want to drink anything at all._

Right then and there, when the moment came, I just told her two options.

In our date, I saw some things that made me think about the night when
I saw her story of her party and first noticed I was starting to lose interest.
She had promised to give me all of the attention she doesn't give me on the
phone, yet several times she was on her phone answering messages to other
people.

Did she really want to be there?

Later, she would tell me how at the party of her friend she was one of only
a handful of people wearing masks.

"I actually thought about cancelling you. Well, maybe not cancel, but tell you
that I was feeling a bit sick in my stomach and a headache.

"Like, I wanted to kiss you after today.
I want to kiss you, but, I don't want to make you sick and ruin your holiday.
We can kiss next time when you return."

In me head, I doubted there would be a next time. Even if she promised me,
even if she later fulfilled that promise, I would not see her for another month.
Instead of sharing with her my desperation to kiss her,
I lied saying that I'd consider it.

I told her the story behind my roommates teasing me with her trip to Ontario.
She promised she wouldn't do it to me on my return.
She promised me we'd go to the cat café one day.

We left after 16h.
I was feeling a little anxious about the time.
Like Armando, I kept them to myself instead of saying anything.

I walked with her to the same metro station where we met.
She said something about putting her mask back on.
By now, I have told the story of what happened after to several people yet
I don't really remember what exactly I said.

I remember her surprise in response, her opened eyes tinted with a bit of
shyness that caught me of guard. "So, you do want to kiss me?"

Her demeanor changed completely as she got closer to me.
She placed her hand gently on my lower left arm.
I don't remember whether I put mine on her lower back or her hip.
I am sure, though, that I laid my fingers gently on her cheek after our
lips' first touch.

It was longer than I was expecting and still not enough.

She made a comment about kissing me again.
I welcomed her without catching back my breath.
I held her closer. This time I didn't want to let her go.

After half a minute or a lifetime, we pulled back.
I noticed her face had changed.
There was now colour on both her cheeks and her voice.

"Text me whenever you get to the airport, I don't want to think I made you
miss your flight," she asked of me. "No, you know what, I'll text you."

I jogged home and ran some of the way.
I picked up my luggage and called an uber.
Before he arrived, I started telling people about what had just happened.

I got to the airport and went through security in a breeze.
The metal detector wasn't like the one in the US.
I had asked Armando yesterday with the intention of telling him why it makes
me anxious.
He dismissed me to go to his weekly call with his girlfriend,
so when he later asked me by message, I dismissed him back.

I had still close to an hour before boarding.

The flight was oversold.
They were looking for volunteers to be moved to a later flight.
Volunteers would be compensated with food and some money.

I thought about the 50 dollars of Uber that I had just spent because of my date.
I didn't want to go back home.
Still, it would be easier for me than for other people.
Sonny wouldn't even be at her house by the time that I was supposed to arrive.
And so, I stoop up and went to the counter to volunteer myself.

Later, they finally said that the money was a thousand dollars.

I got stuck with two older quebecois men. They annoyed me at first.
When we got to migration, I got stuck with them.
They had to wait for their baggage.

I was misgendered once and felt insecure about it.
It's the second time that I am called _sir_ here.
This time it was in French.
I noticed how later I would unconsciously speak with a higher voice.

I had to wait a couple of hours for all the bureaucratic hell of it.
I ended up with a voucher of 10 CAD for in any restaurant in the airport,
and another one for 900 CAD.

I didn't even have to go back to my apartment.
I will be arriving around the same time as Sonny.

I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight either.

I got on the 23H flight.

The second time back in, I did have to go through the 3D scanners.
Nothing flashed; or the security officer didn't need to pat me down.
Could it be that she pushed the male button?

Later, in Mexico, as I went outside to be picked up by Sonny,
a taxi driver called me _joven_.

While I was waiting for Sonny on the steps inside the airport drinking my
coffee, I texted her how the migration officer had been weirdly different
with me than with the previous people.
I remember seeing a family at her counter and she was all laughs and smiles.
She seemed even warm and nice.
I felt relieved when she freed up and called me to approach her booth.

At first, she was cold. Then, slowly, she made me feel uncomfortable with her
hostility. She asked for my name after seeing my face and comparing it
to the picture in the passport.
Did I have a beard-shadow?
It was very possible as I had shaved very early given Armando's drama.

It's been more than 24h and he has not replied to my apology.
I thought about sending him, half-jokingly,
_oh, well, I'll just go fuck myself, I guess_.

I just let it go.

We got to Sonny's and went straight to bed after changing our clothes.
She asked if she could hug me.
I agreed.
She put her arm over my stomach and slowly moved her hand up to reach my breast.
I stopped her the first couple of times.
I still had the phantom sensation of Kate's hand on my arm.
I remembered Kate specifically stating she wasn't looking for anything
exclusive during our first date and, more recently,
her explanation of not really being in a mental space to be having a serious
relationship.

Could she have been scared off by my most recent messages?

With that in mind, I agreed to Sonny's advances.
She asked me to turned around and tried to kiss me.
I moved my face away and told her no.
I was not ready to replace the taste of Kate.
While she touched me under my pants,
I kept imagining how different would it feel if instead of Sonny's it
were Kate's fingers down there.
I thought about the warm sensation of the side of her palm on my breast.
At that point, I stopped Sonny.

Things didn't go well afterwards.
She kept insisting that we could have casual sex.
I argued that it's impossible for me to have casual sex with her,
given how I have—and will keep having—feelings towards her.

She threw back to my face how me letting her start was, as matter of fact,
me using her.

She was not wrong.
It made me realize that letting things go even further wouldn't make it
any better for anyone.

She cried telling me how she had her heart broken.
Someone cheated on her last March.

In the morning, I received a message from Kate replying to my last ones.
She asked me what had happened in the end.
She shared with me that she saw "Love, Actually", her favorite Christmas movie.

I sent a message to Paty confessing her that,
around the time of the picture I had sent her of us, I had a huge crush on her.
Apparently, she had one on me as well.
She sent me an audio explaining succintly how she liked me a lot back then,
but because she was interested in Paola, she didn't pursue anything.

"Talking about rewatching stuff. See, I can't sleep on planes.
The whole flight, I kept reliving the memory of us outside the metro station.
Exactly how like, when I was a child,
I would smell those small sample paper-strips of perfume,
over and over, until all the fragrance faded and nothing but the paper remained.

"I feel a little silly telling you now. But, even up to when we were close to
landing, I would still lose my breath a little as I got to the moments
before our kiss."
