"What's your name? [...]
I'm Meghan. [...]
Ok, Sofia, I'll be going to the restroom.
You're very pretty."

...

"What about yours? Are they regular?"

"Oh no, uh, I don't get them at all."

---

The cover fee was 10 CAD with 3 CAD for the coats.
Someone said that the coat closet was mandatory.
We didn't have enough cash for all of us.

"Maybe we can sneak you in."

I felt a sudden cold flash of anxiety.

The woman at the entrance asked a girl for her for the ticket.

I went back to the ATM and just took out some cash.
I walked towards the end of the line.

"Did they send you back?", said the guy in line in front of me.

He was a guy coming alone to the club.
He was visiting from Chicago for work and decided to get a night out.
I would later see him several times inside.

Two or three times I saw Alda and Abby glancing back at the line looking for me.
Maybe I would have been allowed to feel annoyed at them, but I honestly didn't.

When I finally entered, we went straight towards the restrooms.
Abby was the first one to get into a stall, then Alda.

Two girls were standing in front of me, but I wasn't sure they were in line.
Instead of just barging in, I moved back to the line.
I touched the shoulder of the girl in front of me and pointed to the vacant
stall in front of us.
When she went in, I saw Abby being pulled by the hand by a girl.

I came out from the stall and met Alda outside.

"Where's Abby?"

"She went dancing", I told her trying to mask the envy in my voice.

We were dancing next to each other.
I was too conscious of every single move my body made.
Trying to enjoy myself was getting very tiring.

I saw a pair of girls approach us.
I exchanged glances with the one of the right, but ended up dancing with the other.
She was dark blonde and her eyes reminded me of a tiger.

Slowly we were facing each other and went closer and closer until our thighs
were interlocked.
Her fingers kept gracing my arm and I put my hand on her lower back with as
much care as if she were made of porcelain.

We would go down a little towards the floor and I would feel the warmth of her
legs through her jeans.
The feeling of her black blouse sticked to my fingers even when I would shyly
take my hand away without knowing where else to put it.

I kept looking at her feline eyes and imagining how I would approach her neck
and slowly wander towards her mouth were not for our masks in the way.

She pulled her's down and asked for my name.

The music got in the way so she moved her ear towards me.

"I'm Meghan." I felt the warmth of her whisper.

A storm was developing inside my stomach;
I could feel a throbbing pull in my lower abdomen.

I didn't mind it until I started feeling something move under my skirt.
I didn't know how to move so she wouldn't realize that I wasn't flat under
there.

Did she notice it? She must have.

"Well, Sofia, I will be going to the restroom; you're very pretty."

I woke up around one or two hours ago.
It's 6h right now.
I keep wanting to go back to the pictures of the conversation with Kate,
but I have to remind myself not to get my hopes up.

I get too invested way too quickly.
*Last week I didn't know she existed*.

_...she'd only loved two things.
The first was her long dark hair.
The second was how easily she could cut it off and felt nothing_.

I'm starting to feel tired again.
My eyes feel puffy and heavy.

_I hate dating with a passion._

Like an unconscious instinct,
I went to Her and started looking at profiles of several women.
I wasn't interested in any of them.

I was taken back by how quickly Abby was swiping the profiles of the women in
her Tinder.
She barely needed to see more than the first picture.
She was as quick to accept a girl as she was to discard another
entirely and throw her away ready to look at the next one.
Only some times would she stop and open the profile to glance to the first
lines of their description or to see some of the other pictures.

Is that how people see me on the apps?

Maybe there was nothing wrong with my Tinder profile after all.
