It was during Christmas or around that time.
One of those days of the season.
I was in Mexicali, in the house of my aunt and uncle.
Nobody was outside anymore.
The pool wasn't finished yet, I think.
Everyone was inside waiting for midnight or watching a movie.
I'm not sure if we were already talking or if the call took me by surprise.
It was her.
That, I knew before I answered.
Her voice was an expected pleasure.
I can't remember how many days or weeks were since the last time we've seen each other.
She wanted to talk, I took the call outside.

She told me how she went to the United States.
Barnes & Nobles was one of the places her parents took her.
She had seen the perfect gift.
She narrated it, as if it were something magical.
How she saw it, how it was perfect.
A little notebook, like the ones I love.
She looked at it, held it in her arms.
There was a drawing of the world in the cover, like an antique map.
I had to have it.
She had to buy.
Except she didn't.
Whether it was expensive or her parents said no, I don't remember.
It was the perfect Christmas and farewell gift.
Or it would have been.

I did receive a journal,
but it didn't have a world in the cover and it wasn't from her.
It was indeed the perfect gift for me,  the perfect farewell.

I never forgot about that call, that journal.
Why didn't she buy it?
Was that the reason?

I went to Spain and came back.
We broke up and made up and broke up again.
A lot changed.
But that journal stayed the same in my memory as when I found it in that store.

She was going to France.
Christmas was coming up.
Maybe it could be the perfect gift for someone, so I bought it.
_I always give the perfect gifts_, sometimes she would say.
I just had to give it to her when we met.
I'd give it to her as soon as I saw her.
She could open it later.
She had to have it with her in France, no matter what.

Except we didn't meet.
We had plans, but they died.
We made other ones and they died, too.
Not a single plan of meeting survived.

She had promised she wouldn't leave without us seeing each other.
She would not leave without saying goodbye.
It was another promise she didn't keep.

She left.
But the journal stayed; wrapped with a little note inside.
For months it stayed with me, hidden, waiting to be either given or thrown out.

She went and came back.
The days, the weeks kept passing by.

We finally saw each other one Friday.
I had enough. I was angry.
Parts of that anger are within me still,
flowing in my veins like a poison that hasn't died nor killed.

We exchanged some fake smiles, artificial hugs, a book, the journal and 15 minutes.
She went again.
Those were the last words we said to each other.

Just today I thought again of breaking the silence.
Crossing the ocean between us.
Maybe I've been unfair.
Perhaps she's right, and I'm the one isolating, keeping her apart.

I finished taking my clothes off and went to the computer and saw that map,
that drawing of the world on the cover of that same familiar notebook.

A doubt blazed through my mind burning.
Its edges poisoned with that sweet hate and anger.

I wasn't sure.
I hadn't open the wrap in months.
But there it was that world, just as I remembered.

A birthday gift.
_The perfect gift_, Mallinalli, her friend, wrote in a Facebook status.

I read both comments, the one written by her and the one from Monica.
She loved her and wished her the best.
She would always love her so much.

And the world burned.
And my mind screamed.

She wouldn't do that.
It had to be another, a different one.

I still can't fully believe it.
Three notebooks, three different gifts.
The one she didn't buy,
the one I bought but didn't give,
and the one she bought and gave.
They can't be the same.

I am the monster, not her.
I am the devil.
Her angel who fell.
She wouldn't be capable.

I'd prefer that she had thrown it out like she had discarded me.

But that's a lie.
A part of me wishes that she did.
I want those three notebooks to be the same so I can still hate her;
so I'd have a reason to feel this anger;
so she's now the devil and I can stop being the crying monster.
