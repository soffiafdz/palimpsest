"I want to make out with you; I hope you will invite me to your place."

...

"You know, this is the first time I have sex with someone without knowing their last name."

---

It happened, I guess. Finally.

I had sex.

I met Amanda at the italian _caffetiera_ close to home.
I was pretty punctual, entering the place at exactly 14h30.

I saw her sitting at the booth before I realized she had texted me she was there.

I ordered a latte before joining her.
We chatted for a bit and filled the silences by drinking water.
The conversation was nice—which wasn't really surprising since I liked her from
that first night that we had those deep questions in Tinder.

The weather was nicer than usual.
That's the reason she asked me to meet half an hour after the arranged time.

When we got tired of drinking water after finishing our coffees,
we decided to walk outside.
Unintentionally, the route we took brought us back to the dog park at Dr Penfield.

When we returned back downtown,
after passing the window of a sushi place and talking about our trips and
favourite foods,
she asked me nonchalantly if I had any other plans later that day.

None of the girls from Hinge—_Turkey_, _EyeDr_, _JewishGirl_—had replied back to
my messages.
Other than _the writer_ that I'd meet on Saturday morning,
I didn't have any plans at all.

We went to get some food.
I had just mentioned I've been enjoying Asian food so she proposed getting
some sushi.
There was a good-rated place close-by.

When we got there they asked us if we had a reservation—even though it was
completely empty—and the ambience was the one of a very fancy place.

"What is your money situation like?" She asked me.

We—I?—could afford the food.

We continued the talk about ethical non-monogamy and dating in general.
We pondered out loud, together, how would a three-way date would work.

I told her the stories about how I asked Jess if she wanted to kiss me and
she said no and that other time I didn't get the code of going together to the
restroom.

She told me to my face that she thought I was pretty.
When I asked her to say more about it, she mentioned the way I was holding
my hand to my face and the small triangle formed above my eye with my lose
lock of hair.

I responded with how I was deeply focused in her eyes.
They were green and looked as if they'd taste like herbal tea.

She told me to my face that she was attracted to me.
Actually, how I reached out to her multiple times was one of the reasons she was.
Calli had asked me a couple of sessions before,
if I had ever realized there might be someone out there who,
instead of thinking I am needy or dependant,
would read my insistence as interest and care.

We came back and came to my room.
I hung my blue cloth mask at the door handle as an inside joke to myself.

The next morning, Alda texted me asking me how it had gone and added a picture
of the door.
I guess I told both her and Armando about that.

We had sex.
I ate her out and she did me, too.
I am not sure if I made her cum, but she definitely enjoyed it.

She kept grabbing my hands and moaning as I was caressing her hipbones
while I was stroking her clit with my tongue.
There was so much wetness that I could swallow her taste.

She let me know that she was over-stimulated and would want me to either
penetrate her or go down on me.

With one of my exes, two fingers was too much.
With another, after the second finger, we'd move on to using a vibrator.
Once, I asked one of them to use two with me.
This is the first time that I used three fingers on someone else.
I didn't think of offering her using one of my toys.

She took off my underwear without flinching.
She tried to lower the skin from the tip of my genitals and I didn't realize
she had already done it before I tried to warn her
it wouldn't go down all the way.

I don't think she noticed how scared I got when I found it hard to get it
back up.

I read somewhen somewhere how, with this condition,
sometimes lowering the foreskin carelessly can lead to inflammation and
lose of circulation.
I would not want to have to go to the ER with an inflammed glans as a woman.

I didn't come, but she did get me hard.

I offered trying to put it in after remembering the chat with Héloïse—who
hasn't replied nor seen my last messages.

She hesitantly brought up if I had a condom.
Maybe my secure and quick answer reassured her.

We couldn't put it in, though. So it didn't happen.

My favourite part of the night, even more than the sex,
was the two of us just lying naked on the bed holding each other and,
every once in a while, kissing softly on each other's heads.

I didn't know if it was expected or over the top,
but I told her that she was welcome to spend the night if she wanted to.

She didn't.

"I think I'll leave before I fall asleep",
she said around half an hour after my proposal.

When I walked her to the door of my apartment,
I asked her to text me that she had arrived safe.

"I'm sorry.
I'm really bad at doing that, so don't think I died."

I didn't press the issue.

During one of our earlier conversations,
she mentioned me that she's really bad at texting and takes a lot of time to reply.
As I told her when we brought back the subject in our second date of the day,
that reassured me that it wasn't because of me.

Last night I went to Thomson House with the guys from the lab.
As I walked towards the building,
I saw a blonde girl with a beanie walking uphill with a plastic bag.
I discarded the idea that it could be Vicky,
just to realize later that she actually was.
