"Nessun maggior dolore Che ricordarsi del tempo felice Nella misseria"

I am back at 0. I skipped a day but it was on purpose. 

The first time I lost the count I decided to talk to her. I thought she would be back. It was my fault she was gone, I thought. I avoided her, I distanced myself, isolated me from every person who wanted to help me. She just were the first. I decided to open up to everyone. Why should she be the difference? I was better. The count was back to 0. I could be the one to break the silence. 

I did and she replied. She was back. The count began again. A new number, a new beginning. I started the conversations but she continued them. I didn't wait for her anymore. I told her about everything. I was myself with her. I thought she was ready. She wasn't. Rene was right. More than I thought. 

Yesterday was the day that I waited for a long time. We planned it since the beginning of the month. We bought the disguises, we tried them for the party and I would be outside. I would be walking in the streets, exhibiting me, being vulnerable, open. I was scared of this side of the border, the line, the booth, the returning. I would not be wearing a costume or had my face painted.  I had to be wearing different clothes and carrying the costume in my bag. What would I do at the time of returning? Should I change again? Wouldn't Mexico's officers be more rude? 

I didn't want to think about those things, so I didn't. I didn't even think what I would do in my own house. How would I exit? How would I come back? 

I wore black leggings with the light black sweater on top of the blouse. I was androgynous enough to not catch attention and be carrying the least and lightest extra clothes. "What do you have in the bag?" In my bag I would  just have the skirt and the cape, besides both of our make up bags, wet napkins, the camera, and our wallets. "Just our costumes, do you want to see?" "No, I trust you with my life"

My family would cross the border too, but earlier. I had my house all for myself. Everything was turning out fine until they left. I saw myself in the mirror all changed and I was surprised at how good I looked. I liked it. I look normal. Neither manly nor feminine. Just normal. I sent a picture to Cahterine. Later I went upstairs for something and decided to send one for Monica, too. 

"I could dress like this daily. Let me see your costume" "With exercise pants? Are you kidding? It looks horrible" 

It hurt me. She did it again. 

"Fucking killjoy. I will cross like this because it's light and I don't want to be wearing a costume. Go fuck yourself, I am just trying to be nice, you big jerk." 

She changed her tone and asked me questions. When will I change? where? I was right, I wouldn't look like my passport picture. 

I was sick of that empty niceness, her fake gentleness. I had to kill the pink elephant. 

I wasn't angry anymore. I just was hurt how she attacked my appearance. It hurts me, it hurts me more to hear it from somebody else. 

"It's that I don't get use to you referring yourself as a woman. I need time." 

I hadn't asked her to call me that, I had not mention once the name. I showed her a picture and used certain pronouns. She offered me sympathy and support. She had sworn to always have my back. Now she couldn't even see me. I knew I would lose friends, but I confessed to her that I missed her. I wanted to share this new part of my life with her, I missed my best friend. I opened up like I did with Anahi, Chevo, Jessica, my mom and Paola. Like many many times I did with her. 

"Now I can't deal with that." 

I understood. I gave her an out. "If you want we can keep our separate ways and you can look for me whenever you're ready, or at all. I'll understand" 

She took it and gave back just two letters. 

OK, I echoed. 

I decided to skip the day. Make the count back to 0. I don't want to count the days again or note her absence. I just let this page do that for me. 

...

My tights torn, I lost my keys, I found them plugged in, my battery died. When Catherine came to pick me up and I put the new pair as she changed her bra I wanted to tell her. I started but my voice broke. I started to feel what I was really feeling. I started to hurt her again. She left, it wasn't my fault but it was because of me. 

I knew I'd loose some people. I never thought Monica, the one who promised full support and unconditional love would be the first to go. "She needs time", Rene warned me before she later confirmed it. 

I doubt she will come back. 

Yesterday I lost my bestfriend. 

When exactly was it when she lost her boyfriend, and husband and father of her kids and sharer of her life? 

"She was in love with Ivan. Now she has to be friends with Sofia" 

"She lost Ivan. She might feel betrayed. It's a lot what she has to take in" 

I am a lot to take in. I am freak. I am sick. 

I won't be dead again. I'll live. 

I will live.

"You deserve better friends" 

I am scared of dying alone. 

I spent the whole day in my house, doing nothing, thinking of nothing; kicking and screaming in an ocean of darkness. I thought of what to write today, "The words are heavy, they're a huge weight in my head that I have to carry and unload. I am tired." 

The first sentence is a better description of today. I am still hurt. This was a second Sunday in a row. I underestimate it's effects. 

I woke in the morning. I hear something, some voices, there was life in my house when I came back to sleep. I dreamed something. Medrano was in it. There were some swords and another people. It was raining and the day was dark and gloomy. We walked and I was given one. Everyone started playing with them and I just wondered if they were sharpened. One of them picked me as opponent and swung. I stopped and showed how they were really used. I was scared. Was I afraid of being hurt? 

I was back on my house, in my room and the sword was lying beside my bed. I felt my face dirty and for some reason I went to the mirror to check. There were brown little spots on it. Little dark freckles here and there, like the one I have on my stomach. I felt disfigured. I turned and then again there were more and more. I blinked and it was dirty. Was it dirt or something else? 

I woke and looked for people. I sent a message to almost all the conversations I have. Anahi, Catherine, Eusebio. I wanted to talk to someone. Was it today or yesterday? I can't recall. I felt this urge to have people near me. I wanted them close. I didn't want them to go away. When nobody answer I felt lonely. Anahi answered my message an hour before I saw it. I told her about Monica and her answers were brief. Am I really her friend? Hours later I told her I wanted to be closer. I don't want her to go, though she left two years ago. 

I thought about Paola's words. "The important thing is that you know that the people that care about you have your back". 

Who are those people? The ones I told them about me refer to them as if I had another friends, closer friends. Nobody knows me but Catherine. Chevo and Jessica don't know me. Paola doesn't know me. Anahi barely knows me. My mother just knows what I told her. 
Monica knew me. Monica knew me once better than anyone. The man she knew is death. She left. 

I was over her. I made a mistake reaching out for her. No. I said that same thing when I regretted seeing her in the plaza. "It was a chance to realize she's not the same", Rene told me. Maybe that's what those 5 days were, too. Another chance to see how everything has changed. 

I resented the idea of being the same. Of having and noting nothing different. I do things differently. I feel and look different. This is the change I so desperately wanted. 

I was alone with my father today. I was still in bed when he told he would go to the laundry. I was alone again, in my house, in my thoughts, in my feelings. Catherine texted me for a while. I had her carnet and she came to pick it up. I invited her in and she stood for a couple of minutes. 

"BTW Monica was in San Diego, too. I think she did go to a party" 

My father arrived and she left. He didn't ask a thing. I didn't say anything either. We did nothing wrong. There was a reason. It was an open secret. My life now is an open secret. 

I felt the urge to talk and open myself to him. Say it. Let it out, scream it, bleed it. Shower him with the truth. Let my chest explode and blast him with what's bothering me. I would skip all the bullshit and filler and just say it. "Dad, I am not your son" 

"Dad, I am sorry, but I am not a man" 

"Dad, I am scared." 

"Dad, I am hurt." 

"Dad, I am a woman." 

"Dad, I am a freak." 

"Dad, I am trans." 

I didn't. I stopped myself and went to bed. I opened my mouth but filled it with food instead. 

I feel the pressure of time again. That is not the reason to open up. 

"What will you wear to the party?" 

"I don't know" I had the answer already but I answer I didn't know. I really don't know. I don't know. I have doubts that hurt. I went outside and people saw me and being like this hurts. It hurts more than ever. She left and I don't care. I do care. I care about everything. I am scared and hurt. I am little. I am fragile. 

I need help and I need to ask for it. 

I thought she would had used the name. I told her. She knew. She needed time. I need time. 

I need time, too. 

I want time. I want it to stop and let me breath.

"Landin, Andrea, Monica; what does the capital has that makes all the relationships end?" 

Tiziano Ferro was an italian singer which had his success here in Mexico when I was in elementary school or jr high. I was a child and had Jessica as a friend. I didn't listen to music except for what played in the radio in my mother's car. Jessica liked him. Her mother, my godmother, liked him, too. A lot of girls liked him. Months, years?, later he would give an interview in Europe where he would be asked about his success in Mexico and how was his experience here. He answered about his feminine fandom, and how there were no beautiful women in Mexico. The interviewer wasn't as drunk as him, so he try to cover the situation talking about Salma Hayek. He buried his foot deeper in his throat and answered she was the exception. All of them were short and had a lot of facial hair. 

His fandom evaporated and I didn't hear another song from him until today. There would be rumors about his sexuality. It was said like a joke. He was attacked then by it, like it was something to be ashamed. 

I drove today. I loaded my own gas. Nobody came to my window and everybody there was doing it themselves. 

I woke up early and answered the phone. No, I didn't reach it on time. There wasn't one in the living room and when I got to the one in my parent's bedroom my father had already hung up. I dialed him back so he could tell me that the serviceman would come before noon. 

I got in the shower and put just underwear. I forgot to shave my chest so I did it with the DE razor. When I was going to start with my face I decided to put on the pants in case the man arrived. I finished lathering up when the doorbell rang. I welcomed him shirtless and half of my face white. He got in the laundry room as I returned to the bathroom and finished with my face. 

"Son!", he screamed when I was putting the undershirt over my bra. I covered with my shirts and take the papers to him. He was done. I just needed to sign. 

I talked to myself in the morning but I can't recall if it was before or after him. To whom was I really talking? What was I saying? I explained and narrated what happened on Saturday. Anahi, Monica. What will happen in four months. I remembered Anahi's question about what was I going to wear. I recalled the feeling of pressure I had when I was alone yesterday with my dad. 

I'm almost out of life pills. There are just two for tomorrow. Catherine will drive me to the pharmacy to get the refill. I had thought about lowering my own dosage in half. They would last me twice the time. What I spent for two bottles could last me a complete month. 

I need them now more than ever. I am eating a lot. I am feeling a lot. I am hurt. I am desperate and confused. No, I am all but confused. Now I know what I want. I don't know if I am ready to ask for it or deal with its consequences. 

When we arrived to school, Melissa told us there would be no class with Zayra. We skipped Vinicio's. I proposed eating Teriyaki and Catherine proposed going to the beach. We could try the one near Argana. 

The burnt my yakimeshi and I burnt Argana's rug. My vegetables were left a long time on the grill and I pulled the hose and knocked down the hookah. The charcoals stayed hidden under the pillows for a couple of seconds. The smoke screamed my mistake but no one heard. This was the third time we sat in the other side of the second floor. 

I lend her my undershirt. She wore it for the rest of the day. She does look like a girl even with my own clothes. She stood just with my shirt and her bra. If I wore that same outfit I would be seen as a man. What difference did it have the costume to the other clothes? Why did they see me like that there but not here? Is it the United States? No. It was here. Was it the make up? Is it my face? 

Why do I want so much to be seen like that again? 

Why did it hurt so much to take the costume off? 

Or did I put the other one on?

"You really are pretty... Do you believe me?" "...no" "Have you ever believed me?" 

Tomorrow I'll see him. I'll talk about this week. All that has happened since our last session. There are just four or five sessions left. Zayra's workshop, Monica's leaving, Anahi's question, Catherine's costume, my father's expectations, everyone's expectations and reactions. 

I am sad and scared. I feel alone and vulnerable. My life pills were empty and I bought another two bottles. "For how long will you take them?" "Give me two bottles" "So it will be for a month then, right, sir?" He was wrong. I take double the dosage. I need a double dosage. Two pills daily. They are enough. No, they're not. They help me with the depression but that's just half of my problem. 

Tomorrow after the hospital we will go to the United States. I want to buy something. Anything. I think of pants that I can wear daily or make up to cover my facial hair, or a smaller bra to see if it fits, or a longer skirt that I can wear on special occasions with Catherine. 

I've been waking up and wanting to look as I looked this Saturday. I want them to see me like that. I want a person to get close to me and Catherine and calls us girls. I want everyone to see us alike. 

After the pharmacy and eating the sandwich it was too early for Andrea to arrive. We decided to lose some time walking around the plaza. We entered the store were I bought the last things. Catherine was going to look for some hoses. We walked past by the make up section. One clerk got near us and offered his help. "Would you let someone give you orientation?". There was a woman sitting in a chair with one man applying make up to her face and hiding the marks under her eyes with a white cream, explaining every step of the process. I thought "no". I couldn't see myself sitting there in front of the whole store. What would he say? What would he think? Men don't wear make up. I am not a man. He's a man and he knows more than the woman sitting in the chair. Would people laugh? 

The woman sitting beside us in the trolley stop didn't laugh. She did notice, didn't she? She saw as Catherine was applying to me. She tried to avoid seeing us directly. Was she ashamed for ourselves? Did she go home and talk to her husband or best friend about the young people sitting in the trolley stations dressed with capes and the young man being made up? 

How can I wonder if I'll go to the graduation in a dress if I can't see myself even buying make up? They go to the salons to get all painted and ready. I don't want any of that. I don't want an extravagant hairdo or a colorful face or a long and fancy dress. I don't want none of that. Why do I care then? I saw the pictures and they were nice. I don't look abnormal or hideous or nothing. I don't want that but I want even less to look like a man. 

Yadira didn't wear a dress. She wore a pantsuit. They were women clothes and she looked normal. No, it wasn't normal. The norm was of all the women wearing dresses or skirts. She stood out but it wasn't weird. It would be weirder seeing her wearing something that doesn't fit with her. 

Suits don't fit me anymore. 

If I wore a dress would they still take my picture? Would they ask me to stand up with all the men behind the sitting women? 

In every picture I'd be that anecdote. I'd be the weirdo from that generation that went dressed as a woman. 

I got home and wondered what to wear tomorrow. Should I wear jeans? Women jeans? Leggings? "Exercise pants"?, as Monica called them? I would not wear a skirt. No. No. I won't mix men and women clothes. I'll have to walk to session and then go to the hospital. 

I saw the leggings and wanted them. Catherine doesn't even like them that much. Today was the first day that I wore a sweater. 
I looked at the t-shirts. I can wear the white bra. I wore an almost transparent blouse, a t-shirt would be nothing If I wore the other long sweater, the black one. 

I have the long red one, and a new one, white, with a hoodie. That is transparent, too. 

Do I dare to not change this time?

"I feel off about something. I spent half of my money and I have just a pair of men jeans. And then I think about buying something else and wonder: ' I could buy underwear, but I already have some of those. Nobody notices them anyway. If I buy something else, real clothes, will I actually wear them? Nobody will see them anyway; what's the point?'"

I cheated. I wrote, copied and pasted non-meaning sentences yesterday. I didn't want to break the chain of days. Nobody will see and confirm that my words have meaning. I didn't cheat anyone but myself. 

Yesterday I was going to therapy. I'd meet Catherine in the hospital. I knew what clothes I would wear. I prepare myself and drove to where I always park. This time Catherine didn't ask me what I was wearing. She did sent those messages but they would not appear on my phone until the night. I walked from my car to the oxxo near Rene's office. I was wearing the leggings and the t-shirt and hoodie hybrid that I'd never worn before. Its edge barely covered my crotch. Over all of them I put the thin black sweater. It flowed as I walked and covered me more. I felt a lot more comfortable than some other times. I did mention the outfit with Rene but he didn't ask me if someone saw me. He just listened this time. We talked at the end of the session about my worry of the doubts that Anahi's question flowered. The graduation would be the last event of Ivan. It could be the closure of my life as him. Everyone who knew him would be there and I could break that phase. Wearing a dress there would be chaotic. "It would be a brave thing to do", but I would risk a lot. A lot of people would be there and they would see me and notice me and make comments. I don't really want to buy a dress or go to a salon. 

Why do I say it as if I were trying to convince myself? 

I walked back to my car. Not a single person made mention of my gender. I was seen but was I noticed? What do they think? What do they see? 

I arrived to the hospital and the guard did say something. "Welcome, champ", "gentleman", "sir". Do they want to convince me or convince themselves? 

I parked and walked inside. When I exited again, Catherine met me and smiled. She saw my face and then my clothes. She was surprised and it noticed. I didn't gave her notice, I didn't ask for her opinion. I did not say anything about it until she saw it for herself. 

The class ended and we scheduled the session with a patient for next week. 

We drove for the border and start with the line. The phones said it would be two hours approximately. We were there almost at 3:30 in the afternoon. The line moved every 30-40 minutes. It was dark already when we did cross three hours later. We took the first trolley and get off in the H street station. 

A couple of blocks ahead was the Chula Vista Center Mall. She picked a pink dress for her party. I looked at the clothes while she was trying the dresses she'd picked. There were only women's clothes and shoes. I strolled by placing my attention to whatever were in front of me. There were so many options that I didn't knew where to look. I felt overwhelmed with everything. What did I like, what did I want? 

Hot Topic was the next store where she bought a Harry Potter pajamas set. There was an offer of the next item half price off. I took two pairs of jeans and tried them on, skinny and super skinny. The normal ones would be which I'd end up buying. The black tight ones looked like the leggings I was wearing but they felt weird. I really liked them both. I didn't regret the decision of buying the pair until we exit the Mall. They were nice but they were boys'. They were more of the same. I could had bought them with my parents. 

We went to Target and looked at the clothes and the underwear. We picked some and left others and picked another. Catherine and I entered the dressing rooms and looked at each other as we tried stuff. She saw me with the blouse and with the dress. 

I couldn't choose what to take, what to pick and buy. Today before school I tried the stuff on. I sent her a picture of the dress with the black tights. Then I put the black skirt and the purple, dark red sweater. Maybe that's what I'll wear when we go somewhere later.

" I dreamed a lot. I even wrote in my words about the dreams I had inside my dream. You were not on any of them."

The night was long and bumpy. I woke and slept and woke. I had a dream inside another dream. They intercepted on themselves like circles collapsing and compressing on each other. I was in Mexicali, I wrote about Monica. We were in a car somewhere going somewhere else and she made a joke looking at me from the driver's seat. "Why do you always cry?", she says mocking. I do have tears on my eyes but I smile and say something snark and sarcastic. "Look, I am happy" I try to convince both of us. She believes me and says a comment. She uses a feminine pronoun and I don't know if it's good or bad.  We are walking inside a shop looking for something. I am lying on a table and behind me is Graciela from Neuro asking me questions. I am in pain and she tries to help. There is a man beside her who talked to me. He has something. I don't know if it's material or abstract, but she needed it. He gave her a condition: "a question for a question". She confides in him and I see how he uses her. She helps me but he is cruel. I stopped them. I tell him to stop and how he can go fuck himself. 

I dream more and more. I wake in the early morning and Catherine text me pictures. She is in the salon getting her hair done. She is dressed and resting before leaving. We won't talk for the rest of the day. She invites me to wear the blue-green dress she took to Mexicali. It's big on me but she liked it. She could wear the pink one and I that one, "when it gets hotter, maybe in the shore of the beach". 

She leaves and I sleep again. This time it's just black. I stay in bed until after noon. I feel lonely and tired. 

I'll open the phone and send images and texts to different conversations. I want to read something, anything. I don't care if it's just my echo but I need to get something. This feeling will accompany me for the rest of the day. I'll want to do something but lack the motivation to start. 

Maybe I took the pills too late. What if this feeling doesn't come from the depression? 

I think a lot of the last and next session. I thought about the dress and the graduation but it's not really something I want. There is something I want that I have not asked. I do want it. I don't care what I have to do. I want those pills. I want to save my life with them. I want to start living like I should. 

I still fear about rejection. What if Rene rejects me? What if there is no doctor who can help me? What if my own body rejects the substance? What if I'm cursed to this body for all my life? What can I do if this is as longer as I can get? 

Luis said another comments again. "Ladies first" "Mom, Ivan told me he was an hermaphrodite" "I'm not the one who said he has girlfriends and boyfriends". Will he mock me? Will he stop admiring me? Maybe he'll laugh and his laugh and mocking will be different than the usual ones we lovingly share. The difference will be that this ones will do hurt me, they'll break me and end me. Will he notice? Will he care? Should he? Do I deserve it? 

Time is running and the future is closer than ever. I've changed but it's not enough. What if it will never be enough? When will I be satisfied? What's more important to me: being seen as who I am or seeing myself as who I am? 

Monica left and I still think of her. What does she do? Does she miss me? Did she missed me still when we talked again but I wasn't who I was? Did she ever? 

Maybe like Penelope she stayed waiting for me in a bench and time passed and I never returned. I was Penelope when she left for the capital and never returned as my girlfriend. I was her again when she left to France and wasn't herself when I saw her. 

Maybe she was Penelope, too, and as she waited for her lover all this time, I returned instead in his place. 

"She did say she needs time, 'not now', she said. 'Not ready'. But when will she ever be? Why should she? What does she gain from being my friend. I killed the man she loved." 

I miss Catherine. The day is silent and dead without her. What will I do when she ends leaving, too? Who will I have left? 
Will every people I love end up leaving?

"You don't understand. I can't depend just on you, you can't be my whole world. Then it'll happen like today or in February when you'll leave for days: I stay alone and no one to talk to, nobody to see me; I cease to exist"

We talk yesterday on the phone when she returned from her wedding. The call lasted 2 hours. We don't usually talk on the phone. We use text or talk in person, in her car or mine, in the Administration Faculty. We cried but the words are lost to me. 

What is it in Sundays that they kill me? 

I dreamed with Monica again. There was another person but I can't put a face on them. It was night and there was a picture. We talked about who was slimmer and who fatter. I said how Alan looked way huskier. Monica denied him, not his weight but his presence. 

I declared how he wasn't really my friend. The last time I saw him was when he visited the faculty a couple of years ago. "He was never a real friend but he existed". Monica was never my real friend but she does exist. She's gone but she's somewhere. 

While talking with Catherine I thought about asking Rene for the medication. I want them. I've always wanted them but I want to start now. I am not scared, I am not doubtful. 

I knew the effects of the life-pills wouldn't start in until the first weeks. I know the effects of these won't start until the first months. They'll be slow, maybe even painful, emotionally and physically, but I don't care. 

I'll see him Thursday and I'll might start with how I bought clothes last week. Maybe if I go out with Catherine I'll talk about what will have happened. My parents saw me with the leggings and the shirt. They didn't see me when I exited the house but they both saw me when I arrived. I didn't hide anymore. I didn't changed. 

"I want them", I might start just after meeting his sight. "I've wanted them, I've mentioned them and talked about it. I want to start." 

Will he say no? Maybe he'll doubt I am ready. Maybe he was never going to give them to me. Maybe he just can't. 

"I don't know how, or with whom. If you can't prescribed them I wish you could refer me to someone who can, a specialist or an expert. If you can but I need to do some tests first, I'll do them, no matter the price or the blood. 

"If you want me first to say the name to my friends, if you want me to tell everything to my dad first or say them the name, I will. I don't want to do that yet, but I don't want to wait more even less. I don't care about the changes, about their reactions. No matter what I tell them or show them they don't see me. Nobody but Catherine see me. They see the Ivan they've met. I can't blame them if not even I see myself in the mirror. 

"I am sure, I know. I know they won't be magical,  I know they won't even act first. They wait will be months more than weeks. Not even for the graduation might be notable changes and that's fine. I know if they start people with hesitate with my sight. They will be wrong and they might have reactions and comments. I don't care anymore. I want to do this for me. 

"I've been working about asking what I want and need, about showing myself. I am showing myself to you and being honest with myself. I am asking you now what I want. I want to start hormones." 

Will I do it? 

Or will I try to swallow it and end up asphyxiating with my own secrets? 

 ...

Tomorrow is Anahi's birthday. I wanted to talk to her but I didn't know how. I said that yesterday to Catherine. "I am angry with Monica. She looks like the cause of most of my problems: I didn't asked about the pronouns or showed myself because of her own reaction. I am afraid of people leaving me because of how she left me. And I hesitate about talking about myself because of how she would cut me off whenever I tried to talk. 

I remembered our relationship without any problems. We fought and cried but it was good. 

Now am I only remembering the bad things? Was I ever happy with her?

I'm writing now in my brother's laptop. It's forty minutes before midnight and I'm just starting the words. My laptop is upgrading and got stuck somewhere in the 70%. I restarted it since I came home. I asked him for his laptop but he started moving files and made a guest account. What is he hiding? Does it matter? Do I care? 

It's not like I don't have my own secrets. He grabbed one of my keychains that I bought from amazon. He has taken stuff from my room. He has snooped in my life. Does he care? Or was he just that, snooping? In his search was he looking for something specific or was it just a stroll on my life? Has he found something from that life? 

The return key is pressed. This keyboard is uncomfortable. It's not familiar, it's weird. It doesn't fit. If he asked for my laptop I would had lend it to him. Would I hide something? There are pictures and folders. There is one called Sofia-Anahi, with the conversation when I told her about my name. 

Today I woke up and took my life pills. I hadn't shaven in the whole weekend. This morning's shave was, smooth. I was comfortable. It was OK. 

Catherine offered to pick me up. I waited for her. When I got to the car we talked and suddenly I kissed her. I felt her lips just barely touching mine. They were smooth and sweet. We kissed once and then again. She pulled me from the neck of my shirt and whispered "no". We kissed three times again. The person who painted my house knocked on the window after we had finished to give me a letter to my dad. I forgot about it and just remembered. We were talking in the car when she took me home. The comments she received in the wedding she attend Saturday. The wedding of her parents. Several different and important topics were in the air when my father walked from the private street with a white thrash bag in his hand. 

"Did he notice us? ... He didn't look" 

He had arrived last week just when she was here for her sessions log. He parked the pick up just behind her Toyota. I had to signal him to back up a little for her to leave. He did not said a single word about her. Not a question. Nothing. 

What else has he seen that doesn't dare to ask? 

There was no Vinicio's today. I waited for her outside her session. She didn't cried this time. On the way home we talk about her mother. The actions she might have to do to stop her behaviour. "It's not fair. What you did you had to do it, but you're the mother. I am the daughter, she's my mother". 

"I told you, she is capable of letting me outside the house. I think if I do something like that she might hit me". 

We parked outside the Oxxo and talked for a couple of minutes. We bought a bottle of water, tomato juice and two chocolate bars. 

When there was no class we wondered about what to do. She had made us lunch. We kissed before class. She teased me. 

We went to the Soriana near the school. There might be some mascara like hers. She didn't have any condoms in the car, and there was just three left. We bought a package of 5 flavored ones. Later in the day she touched me when we returned from eating japanese food. We were in the line outside the parking lot and her fingers unbuckled my belt and pants. Her fingertips gently stroked my skin under the underpants. 

Graciela arrived but invited us to go to the conference that Yolanda was giving in the central room. There was no class there, either. 
We listened to her previous therapist's voice talk about a case of hers. A phobic young man, a typical case of phobic neurosis. An unresolved Oedipic complex. The libidinous energy somatized in physical symptoms. Psychoanalytic terms. The second semester kids were the ones who organized it. Were they getting it? 

60 sessions she had with him. Almost the same number of sessions Catherine talked. Could she do a conference about her case? Would she say her first name or made up another one to keep her confidentiality? 

Could Rene talk about me? Am I conference material? Would he talk about a melancholic patient with a perverse psychoanalytic structure. An inverse Oedipus manifested in a delirious wish to be the other sex. A dissociated identity. Would he talk about Ivan or Sofia? 

Catherine talked about her parent's wedding. There she would invite me. Who would be by her side? Me or him? Would I wear a dress or a suit? How would she introduce me? Will I be her girlfriend, her boyfriend, her partner? Will they care? 

There will be a ceremony in the church. She talked about the comments in the sermon. A man and a woman. Marriage between a husband and a wife. God created Adam and Eve. How would it be being seated together holding hands while the priest would talk about marriage. Would her family see us? Comment about us? 

First she has to tell his own father. First I have to worry about this Wednesday when I'll wear to the movies the gray dress I bought with her. 

Then, after a lot of things, we might worry about that.

"And that is the way we are raised, in families where we are supposed to care for our parents. What are secrets but ways of protect them?" 
"Couldn't your dad be the one who awaits for you when you step out of the closet?" 

I drove. I didn't shave. I didn't paint my eyes. Today I tied my hair in a bun and wore a sweatshirt of my past and was nobody; neither him nor her. 

Why bother? Tomorrow I'll shave and dress and make up and be whomever I want. I almost forgot to take my pills. 

Late at night I felt the complete opposite of the night before. I was wearing the exact same shirt and pajama bottoms. Then I felt the thick and uncomfortable material of my underwear. It pressed in the wrong way and it scratched and it didn't fit. I pulled down the pants and in complete darkness I took the underpants off and threw them to the laundry basket. I didn't put on another ones, just pulled the pants up again and went to sleep. Yesterday I wore one of the pair of the underwear Catherine gave me. They're smaller and firmer. I wore them the whole day but by the time I was lying in bed I felt them uncomfortable. Again I pulled off and on the pants and threw the underpants in the darkness. Again I slept free. Neither man's or woman's. Bounded by nothing. Being just me. 

Everything's easier as I stop trying to fit into something. 

Catherine and I left home almost at the same time. The guards, again, let everyone in without asking for id. The parking lot was full and they stopped me to wait for it the free up. As they took the cone up I drove to the up side near the faculty. The highschool-looking guard signaled me to an empty space and I parked. I texted her asking her if she had arrived yet but it went unanswered until I got in the building. 

We waited for Zayra outside the classroom as it was occupied. We looked for an empty one down the corridor. I can't remember what we did there. Did we talk? did we kiss? Did she put me against the wall as she passed her hand from my leg, up my hips and navel and through my breast to my neck? 

When we returned our classmates were already in the classroom and Zayra had already come. "How was your weekend?" she asked us. 

We saw the Social Death theme. People who are unseen by society. "Like these times on Facebook". Did I killed myself socially? Did I killed him when I deleted Facebook? Am I socially dead as I don't exist for anyone but Catherine? 

We saw the different videos of the process of dying. Cremation. From the putrefying dead body life is born again. How selfish is from me to burn my corpse and deny nature of its process? 

Vinicio did come today. We were not the full class. Maybe not even half of them. He put us in a circle adn asked us our perceptions and experience with the model. "Why don't you participate?" One by one he asked us different questions. "What do you think?" "What would you say?" "What is your experience?" "How have you applied it yourself?" 

He asked all of us at least once. He asked us how could he improve the class. 

Center ourselves to the positive. How can I forget the problem when it's everything I've seen my whole life? I ignored what I wanted and how I felt. I knew I was sad and miserable but ignored the reason. 

There was a therapist who had this 7 year old girl who had been raped by someone in her house. She had an older sister and a little brother. The three of them had been raped. In the room where everyone: the mother, the father, the siblings, the neighbors, the friends. 

The little girl told every single detail to the therapist. One by one talked about what they knew and felt about the occurrence. The little boy had been raped, too. The older sister was raped first and was threatened by the rapist that if she told anyone he would rape her little sister. She didn't spoke and yet he raped her anyway. The mother knew since it happened when the girl was 4 years old, three years before. 

She was seated crying as she spoke and was hugged by her husband and children. The little girl stood alone in her chair. 

The neighbor kneel in front of the girl and hugged her and apologized. She told her she would care for her. She taught the mother how to be one. 

Secrets are our way to protect our parents.

"Do you want to see me or wait 'till you come?" 

I woke up but can't remember exactly what was it. Was it a scream? I had cold, I wanted to go to the bathroom. They were still here. I went and returned to the sheets. I forgot when was the last time that I felt backache. 

I took my clothes when the alarm blared. Underclothes only, the tights and dress I'd put on later. Yesterday I had doubts. Even now after the day ended I'm not sure how I felt with what happened. 

I looked at the pictures. My made up face with the mask, the costume, the second one in Halloween. I looked like a man. I was a man. It was absurd. Everyone would look through me. I'd be pointed at, laughed, mocked. All eyes would be set upon me and their pupils would burn me. Darkness dressed as laughter would embrace me and drowned me. I'd be gone. Everything would end. 

I'd be dead. 

...why? 

This morning something changed and I came down in just my underwear. My face was done, my body, too. There were spots in my cheek and upper lip that screamed. I murdered them with a dry slash of the blade. The one in my upper lip died with just a small droplet of crimson blood as a last whisper. 

I put the hosiery and then slipped over my head the gray dress. 

I think about us, seating finally in the theater. The big leather sofa floating over a black sea of darkness. Both of my legs raised to the seat. Black and long and thin pieces of meat covered in a gray cloth. Knees kissing each other, lying embraced. My head rests on the mountain from her chest. Her arm surrounds me and we both watch the film. A slow quiet beating of her heart sings a melody to my ear. 

She arrives when I finished with my shoes and hair. I waited for her in the sofa watching the first half of The Flash. I peek through the blinds but she catches a glimpse of my dress. I see her surprise in her smile. She shouldn't be. She already saw me in the picture I sent her in front of the mirror. Later today we will take more pictures but it'll be until we go to the motel. That dreaded hotel cursed with memories. 

The first hotel where I went as Ivan, it's the first which we went after a whole day dressed as me. It's not the first one where I've worn these clothes or even where I arrived dressed. 

The internet is coming and going. It's making me furious. There is a stench that rises and slaps me on my face. It's a musty and bitter odor that tattles the things we did. 

She helped me with my face and we exited the house. We drove to the plaza and I was seen by no one. Not a single person laid eyes on me until we parked and got off. Even then, their sights hit me and slipped as if I were made of rubber. They looked and as if I were invisible, their sight kept on. There was nothing on me that deserved to be seen. This time it was something good. 

They didn't saw a man in a dress. They saw someone. Just that, a person. 

Chavela Vargas is singing right now. 

Catherine grabbed my book and read the last page that is written. In there I'm still in Portugal after a night of drinking and kissing Helena. I'm confused and hurt. There are so many things on my mind that I look for any little bit of distraction to wander off from my reality. 

We are in the plaza and walk towards the food garden. She orders and I just stand by her side. I am scared that my voice will snitch me. I avoid people's eyes but at the same time look for them. I don't know what I want. Do I want them to not see me as they've done? Or would I prefer that they do look at me and notice me. What would that mean? It'd make me sad. Why do I wait for that? 

Later there will be noted discomfort. They'll look stealthy towards me and whenever I catch them, they'll escape clumsily. Like every criminal they'll return and I'll notice them again. What does their eyes mean? Until I talk to Catherine will I realize. 

They don't see me, or not exactly. 

"I realized... it was the first time that they saw us. Two girls holding hands. For the first time I noted the effects of our relationship."

"I don't know how to start." 

Again I walked that short distance from the car to the session. I waited outside a couple of minutes. I looked in my phone the continuation of the conversations with Catherine and Anahi. 

"Where are you?", she told us yesterday in the afternoon. Neither of us saw the message in our respective screens. We were busy walking exposing our love to the world, holding everybody's sights. 

She told Miguel and Carlos. I thought the message was originally to Carlos and then to Miguel. It turned out to be the other way around. "I went out with Sofia to the plaza. She wore a dress and we held hands. It was the first time we showed everyone as two girls." 

She realized how it would be for Miguel every day. A least evil for me would be still worst for her than normalcy. 

I told Rene about yesterday, too. He didn't say anything. I told him about the hormones and he didn't say anything either. I want them, I asked for them, didn't I? What do I need to do? I don't know how many sessions I have left. I don't want anything but a good reflection in the mirror. A way to feel good in my own skin. 

"It makes my skin crawl to think that wherever Ivan goes, you will accompany him" 
"When will you take this load off me?" 

I walked back and went to the hospital. What was the word today? man? young man? sir?

Catherine met me there a couple of minutes after I was on the second floor. I looked down to the children. Some looked at me. Others waved their hands. What do they see? 

A communications major saw us seating in a bench and asked us if we knew where the psychologists were. Why didn't we answer? Why didn't I talk? He already saw me as a man. There was no lie in my voice. 

I talked about next thursday. Will I dress with the skirt and the sweater? Am I scared? Why didn't I say anything? 

I was supposed to ask for the hormone treatment and asked them to see me. To refer to me as a girl. I can't change what they see, but I can ask them how I want to be called. I did the hard one. And stayed silent after the session. 

We met a patient in the hospital. A young girl of 14. She's referred because of her low scores in school. ADHD, memory problems. Autism? Catherine was supposed to ask questions and I to make notes. I hijacked the interview. The mother was disappointed and expected Graciela. "Where is the lic?" 

She got us instead. Would Graciela note the anxiety and the depression? The girl asked to die. She'd prefer to die instead of going to school. Lack of concentration, memory problems, irritability, social isolation. I wanted to help her. I'm excited to think about what to look for. What's the difference between her and Angel? The gender. What's different between her and the other kid with palsy and motor problems? 

When I met the mother's eyes I thought the cause of the disgust was my own presence. Instead of my age or experience, in my mind everything went to my legs, what was over then and between them. 

Both are not of anybody's business. 

"I remember the first sessions ... you told me I was anesthetized emotionally and paralyzed behaviorally ... I know now what is to really feel. Now I am in a rush to actually do something" 

"It caused me conflict to think about being a discomfort to others. Being invisible had its secondary gains. They didn't note me. My presence was not a discomfort. Now it's the complete opposite. I couldn't even put my hand in the arm rest. Now I stand in front of them, wearing a dress, contradicting everything they believe and are accustomed to."

After the hospital I drove us to the park to kill time. Yesterday we went to that motel and today was that park. We park in one of those spots and talked. Talked about her father, talked about me. 

"You can't see it but feel it in my face. In your face is smooth but they're seen". She mocked the commentary I did earlier. I tried to say how even after three hours everyone could see in the picture those traces of my manhood. 

"You didn't shave well today" 

"I did it as I could"

I felt bad. There is nothing I can do. I can burn them with laser. I can scratch the skin over my face daily but they'll grow. I can cover them in paint but they'll still be there. 

I showed myself to them dressed like I left the house. The same way I walked, the same way I got in and faced my brother and parents. Again Luis didn't see me. 

Would he be the exception to everybody? Would he say something?

"Divide your sheet of paper in three parts. You'll think of a loved person with which you've had a conflict. In the first part, write about the things that person gave you ... In the second, enlist the things that this person did not give you ... Finally, think and enlist the thinks that person gave you with the things they did not."

I would not shave today. I would not care about my appearance. I did not even think about which clothes I'd wear. What's the point? 
Yesterday I wore leggings, people saw me but did they notice? What difference does it make if I shave normally or painfully closer? Is there an obvious change when I wear a bra under my shirt? Can anyone note the difference in the color of my eyelashes? Am I the same looking person when I wore legggings? How about the day before that I wore a dress? 

I picked clothes before I made myself breakfast. There was two week-old biscuits in the fridge. I opened one and discarded the stale eggs. The eggshell broke nicely and the egg-white started to gain its color as soon as it fell into the pan. I was chatting with Catherine. What would she wear? What would I? 

I broke fast and didn't want to start the morning routine. Even standing up from bed was a challenge. I showered and scrubbed my whole body. I didn't even wash my hair. What made me change my mind? What made me pick up the brush and lather the soap? I didn't want to. Has it become a compulsion, yet? I started and instead of going with the grain, the first and second time was across it. The last and final was against it. I pushed the skin with the tip of my finger and slashed with the edge of the blade scratching my skin, erasing those little black dots. It wasn't enough. The sound of the hairs dying, its miniature screams echoed in the tiles of the bathroom. I wanted all of them gone so I passed the razor again, closer, firmer, a little closer. In my chin I took a little piece of skin and a red dot appeared in its place. There was no pain. I felt nothing. In my head the idea of picking from it and take my face away crossed. Skulls are indistinguishable between genders to the unprofessional eye. Even then an anthropologist could see through "my lie". 

The alum stung but closed it. 

I changed and went to my room. Catherine stepped out of the shower and asked me if I were ready. I showed her. I've been taking pictures of me in front of the mirror. The red and black shirt. The one I wore today. The gray undershirt, the blouse and the skirt. The dress, the dress with the coat, the sweater over the skirt. 

I didn't covered my face with anything. Catherine noted it. My eyes were smaller. "No, it's just your face that looks cleaner. Like just washed." 

Ramon came to receive payments. I stood with Catherine. We laughed and smiled and hugged. I am happy. I feel better. I don't want to go, yet. I want to keep living. I just thought about Zayra's workshop. I'm not ready to die, I don't want to. 

Before Catherine arrived I opened the log. I have just one session left. Just one more. I may keep going with Rene. I don't know if he is open the see me again, to respect our price. 

He prescribed me. I want another prescription but don't know if he can give it to me. When I have finished with the forced process, should I continue with him? Should I continue with psychoanalysis? 

I should ask him. Is he the best option for me? Does he consider himself my optimum help? Would I be in better hands with someone more experienced? I don't want to go shopping around for a new therapist. I don't see myself scheduling interviews with different therapists and opening up in the first session about my deepest secret just to wait for their reactions. 

What goal do I have? What do I expect from therapy? When he asked me those questions 3 years ago I didn't know what to answer. 

I want to be comfortable in my own skin. I want to be strong enough to deal with the difficulties my life will bring me. I want to get the strength to be myself and show it to the world. I want help with the change to become the person I should be.

"And he's my oldest, Ivan" "You?" "Ivan, I am" "Oh, I thought you were a woman. Maybe it was because of the hair."
"Guys, would you mind if I wore a skirt this Thursday to the movies?" 

 I didn't wrote yesterday. I cheated again. I tried to, I wanted to. We left the house just before noon. We didn't arrive to my uncle's until after midnight. We got early to my old father's house. There were my aunts and my cousins. They are tall. They are bigger. Even the youngest looks bigger than me. He is shorter than me, but he is bigger. I feel small and insignificant in the memory of what happened. I said hi, I smiled and hugged. I did everything I couldn't. I couldn't find my place. Nowhere was I comfortable. With no one could I talk freely. My university, my time in Spain, the work situation, I spoke about a lot of things, they listened. They heard my voice and saw me. Did they? What did I show? 

Everyone is studying and working and being successful. Everybody has their lives sorted out. I don't even know who I am. 

I was inside and hid myself with the boys. When my aunt called us to ask us to be outside, I couldn't find a seat. The tables were dispersed but the seats taken. Where could I seat, to what conversation could I join? My aunt questioned me about my plans. What could I do? What did I plan to do? What do I want? 

People I don't know came. People I should know where there. "It's been a lot since the last time we saw" informed me my father's older sister. She's right. Does she know me? Does the rest of my aunts and uncles? They know my name and how I look. Is that what and who I am? A name and an appearance? 

My uncle will marry next month and we just met the bride. She just met me and knows me maybe not more than the rest of the party. I don't know what they see. When they look to me, do their eyes see me or their memories of who I've been? They see a face, a name attached to it and a series of connections and memories. When strangers, like the mister who met me, look, they see just a face. A face, a body. There is no connection or memories, is there? Or are there with their own life? Maybe they see their own son or daughter, an old friend. Maybe my smile is just like their deceased father's. Maybe my eyes remind them of a lost love. Maybe my hands are long and thin like someone they knew and cared about. 

I don't know any of those memories, being them from known or strangers. I can't perceive what people feel or think when they face me. The only thing I can know is what they tell me. "I thought you were a woman", "Welcome, girls". 

Were they the only ones who saw it or the only ones who said it? 

Does it make a difference? 

They see something, they look, they turn. What's the point of looking to the cause of their curiousness? Is there a difference if they look because I am a man in a dress or because we're two girls holding hands? 

Who am I? Am I the name I introduce myself or the name of my id? 

Am I a man because my papers say so or because there is a dick between my legs? 

This thursday I won't have a patient. A two hour class and a last session. I can go straight from therapy to the hospital and two hours later there is nothing until the movie. I asked them, I told them. The plan is set. Why don't I feel like doing it anymore? 

No, I do. I want to. I wish I could have shown the picture to my mother just as I sent it to Anahi. Would she say something similar? Does it fit a little bigger but my legs look good? I don't look weird. I look normal. Everything looks fine. There is no reason for anyone to turn and stare. Maybe it's Catherine, maybe it's our hands. 

Of course not. 

What will my father think? What will he feel? Will he say it, too? Maybe his mouth will stay shut and his face will scream. 

Will I do it before Thursday? 

Will it matter?

"I see the posts where the three of us commented and they don't make sense." "Aw, yeah, me too." "Because Sofia's don't appear." "Sofi's comments are missing." "Yup". 
"I mean, I understand, but it's not like you can delete Ivan. I don't know how you feel... I can't even imagine it. But I love Ivan very much and we went through beautiful and nice moments. I wouldn't like for him to be forgotten for ever. But again, I don't know how you do feel. If you don't want to open again your facebook and want to forget Ivan, well, it's ok." 

"I am afraid that I ought to dress, talk and appear different than how I really want, than how I really am, just to keep a distance from the image the people who knew me got stuck with" 

Yesterday I forgot to take my pills. There has been almost three months since I started taking them. Even half a day without them were enough to give me a glimpse of the darkness. That familiar drought and heaviness. It was a somber and low voice, a deafening laugh that preceded his comment. "Welcome back" it said just as he laughed again and mocked me. 

I took just one pill. Half of my dosage. Why? 

It's a known phenomenon. People who are on psychiatric medication, just after its effects appear, they suffer a paradoxical risk of relapse. They feel better, the know they are better and they stop their treatment. "Why should they keep taking it? They are better, they never needed it". 

It's the opposite  with me. I forgot to take them and feel worse. I need them, I knew and confirmed I need them. Why did I lower my own dosage? 

Did I miss it? 

Just yesterday I talked with Catherine about my writing. I am good. I can communicate. Can I communicate well because I studied or I decided to study it because I knew I was good at it? I was surprised at how much I liked the writings of the last months of high school. Nobody disliked what I wrote. People would read me and tell me I was talented. In jr high, girls would pass my jean notebook and read it. 

I published several on that stupid social network and await for the number of visitors to come up. I'd look at it several times. It never got up to three digits but there was just one person whom I cared that they were read by. 

I wanted to communicate my feelings and they worked. With my words I met her and got her back a million times. With words she sent me away and with them I reconciled and turned her away. 

Now, I write for nobody. I write for me. In Spain I wrote for me and just for me I kept writing. I have thousands of words that no one but myself has seen. What would happen if someone read them? Would they even care? Will someone ever read this sentence and get a sense of who I am right now? "Is the writer a he or a she? Is the writer the same person? Has he changed or was she always the same?"

I sometimes wish even I could remember how I looked as I wrote. I wish I had taken a picture or a video and got it attached to the text. A secret feature that only I would know. 

Isn't that what words are for? Get a look to the writer's real self. The writer's thoughts and feelings and wonders and fears. The writer's successes and failures. 

That is what all of these are. They are snapshots of my true self. Who cares how I look or appear? What does it matter the clothes I wore that day or the type of glasses through which I saw? Does it make a difference if I wore pajama pants or jeans or a skirt? 

No. Nobody cares. There is not a difference. Who or what I am is not even important, either. 

I am a person just like you. My body aches and feels pleasure just like yours. I cry like your little sister and laugh like your big brother. I have dreams and fears and vices and virtues just like you. These words will never show you how I look or sound or dress like. They will show you neither what or who I am. They'll show you and the world what's really important: what I feel, think, wonder, fear, hate, love... how I am. 

They'll show you, and anyone who reads this, what made me just like you, and what made me unique.

"You are a bad girlfriend, but a good psychologist".

I opened Facebook again. Why should I left it closed? Anahi was right. I can't pretend that Ivan is someone, something I can delete or negate. I am the same person. There are memories, moments that happened and were shared with people. She loved him, Catherine, too. Monica shared with him her love, her confidence, her youth. 

Just as I avoided her and ran away from her, I kept my distance from Facebook. I wasn't over it. I deleted his profile, his statuses, his pictures. All things that he said or did were gone, not just for me, but for everyone. People did miss him. Jessica noted his absence. Johanna, Monica, my uncle. Different cities and places in the world. What would happen if they found me instead? Would I be recognized? 

Just as I returned to Monica and let her leave me. I opened Facebook again. I signed in and look to the almost hundred notifications. There was nothing new. A lot of things happened but nothing mattered. There were a lot of people there, a lot of pictures and comments and happenings. Who cares? 

Monica's status was the first thing that appeared. I denied it, but hers was the first profile I looked. I thought I wouldn't be able to contain the need to look for her. See what had she done. Did she go to a party? Does she love him? Does he treat her well? Is she happy? 

I see through numerous phrases but they said nothing. A lot of texts and images and not a single important thing. Empty words. I scrolled and felt nothing. 

I remembered Halloween. The last day we talked weeks ago she'd go to the United States. I'd look for her in the line and feel her presence behind us. 

I opened the pictures but felt not a wish to scroll. I didn't care and it was weird, different. There were the picture of her instagram where she's with her friends standing in her disguise and the four of them are smiling. 

"I don't get use to you calling yourself as a woman". 

I felt like a freak. I was not a woman. I was not a man. I was something else. I deserved not a name or be called. I deserved nothing. I hated her again and hurt her again. 

That same day Anahi would use his name, my old name. The real name, the official. The one everybody knows. 

What do people see when I stand in front of them? 

I arrived today and there was the old woman from the house across the street. She was watering her plants hiding in the blackness of the night. I got off the car and went for my dad. When the cars where moved I got off and waited reclined on the bumper of the jetta. My father got off and I heard her voice calling him. 

"Good evening, sir", she said in high voice from where she was standing. Her words came after I saw my father's acknowledgement and smile. 

She repeated herself in a little higher voice "Good evening, ma'am". I was standing by his side now. He had crossed the pick up to my side. Did she mistake him? Did she see someone else? Maybe someone entered to the street. There was nobody else. Was she talking to me? Did I hear wrong? 

Did she saw me as my mother or just a woman? I'm taller than my father. I'm the tallest person in the house. It was late and night. Why did I smile when I was alone in my room? 

Manuel Mejia told us to practice making Ceneval items. I wanted to do it. I really had the intention to make the assignment. There was no time. There is no time. 

Tomorrow we will see Paola and her son. All of us but Anahi will get reunited. I feel like I am betraying her. I don't like this feeling. Yesterday we were talking about going to disneyland in December. Will we? Will it happen? I'd really like that. 

Tomorrow we'll have Psycholinguistics. I don't know if it's our turn to give a presentation. I am tired of those kind of classes. I am tired of school, this kind of school. 

I was in the last module of the course and I like it. Nobody else does, nobody likes these themes. How can I study something that nobody of my colleagues wants to? That's supposed to be better. If nobody wants to enter, there is no competition. 

Thursday I'll have my last session. I'll have a test later and then we'll go to the movies. 4 years ago I watched the last movie of a series before entering the university with my friends as somebody's boyfriend. Thursday I'll watch the last movie of another series just before graduating with my friends. This time I don't have that girlfriend. This time I'll be Catherine's girlfriend.

"I love you! You are always welcome as in my home as in my life. Thank you, team of seven" 
"Paola doesn't know about you." "No, she doesn't know I'm her girlfriend." "Just partners, because she doesn't even know about the terms and all of that." "I'll kiss her and freak her out."

How can I start? How will I end? 

What did I do today, what in the last week? 

I had just one class today. It was the last thing of my day. Everything is finishing. Next week will be our test. Next after that, the last classes. Not just the semester is ending. The school, my therapy, my normality. 

I opened Facebook to see the girl who answered that the mail of the teacher with the test material was deleted and lost. I saw her face but didn't recognize her. I came back to the first page. "What's new?" I thought and scrolled, gave a peek to everyone's actuality. The picture of Monica popped up. It was disconcerting. What was she doing here? She's still part of my life. I had given her for lost. Facebook is not my life. It's my past. She, her notifications, even if recent, don't belong to me. They are property of my past. 

I wore a tshirt. Black with long sleeves and long neckline. I hadn't worn it since high school. It's the last small size garment I have left.
I wore it countless times before. It was almost a part of my uniform. Under my polo shirt it clenched my body and covered my arms. It was always usually something I'd wear under a shirt or other thing, never alone. It was the first time I wore a bra underneath. Did somebody saw? No. Nobody ever notices. 

I wore the new sweater over, I had to cover, I am not sure how to be exposed. I was hot when I stepped out of Catherine's car but she said it was noticeable next to my shoulder. I've worn a skirt, I've worn a dress in that same place. Why was today different? 

I didn't shave. I haven't shave in two days. The shadow is not darker than other times. I thought it would be worst. It's just there, like always. It scares me a little to think that tomorrow there will still be a marking behind. What if it never goes? 

I've seen signs. Yesterday I was convinced to up my dosage again. Two pills like before. What stopped me? 

I bought the two bottles and yet I have 4 pills left. If I keep taking one they'll last me a whole month. Just before Christmas. 

Even with just one pill in my system I was fine. I was hapy, I was well. I was impulsive, too, almost manic. I hit the claxon in Catherine's car when she was driving. I took my hand out of the window and flipped the taxi driver that hurried her. I feel this emptiness inside of me. Like something is missing. Is it just nervousness of tomorrow? Is it vertigo of getting close to the edge of this part of my life? 

What did we do before? 

We bought the pills. We looked for the tights but bought make up. I bought the tights. We were in the store when Eusebio called. We'd meet them in the park. They were in the swing that the seven of us were two years ago. Paola met us there. We met the other Paola in her house. The little boy is now a year old. His life. His new life. What will happen of him? I met her mother before even the thought of him crossed her mind. I existed before even the idea of him was born, before his father and his mother met. It was a whole different time. Another life. 

The class was pointless. The same information. It's supposed to be my field of study. I participated and yet there was no list. 
I am supposed to be writing the interview report of last week. Why haven't I started? 

I did start, took up again, to pass the journal. I am with Helena remembering what happen the day before. That's a different time and a whole different life. It feels so far apart it almost hurts. 

What would she think if she knew what I'm going through? I told Johanna what happened with me and Monica and she understood her. What would she think if she knew that she was a part of my life for another year, that just now she really left? 

Tomorrow will be my last session. 

I don't know what will happen after that. 

I'm thankful that's the first thing of my day.

"I made an agreement of 100 sessions with Ivan" 

I finished the formality of 100 sessions yesterday. They ended. I closed that stage. I was wearing a woman's sweater and woman's jeans. Almost all of my clothing were women's. All of it was mine. The only masculine thing I was wearing was the black undershirt. 

I talked and he gave me closure. He told me what he saw. The signs he observed. I was hidden and in a strong shell. I came calmly and sat and gave a synopsis of my week's classes. I talked about nothing. He defended himself. He asked questions several times to which I denied. There was something I had hidden. Something I was strongly disassociated with. I was supposed to lose all barriers and censors and talk freely. How could I show my true self if even I ignored my mask? How could I expose myself if even I ignored it? 

Salamanca was a bubble where everything is perfect and good. We have to go out and come back to reality and it hurts. 
I lived in my own bubble. And certain things fractured it and tumbled it until it broke and like Pandora's box, all of the sorrows went out. 

Ivan will no longer go to session. "The process with Ivan will end. Maybe later a new process with another person will begin. Maybe instead of Ivan, I'll see Sofia." 

I smiled like a fool and answered. He explained how he knew I asked it for certain people but never him. I did. I thought it was the perfect day for telling Chevo and Jessica. It gave me closure. I even forgot to pay him. 

We did the exam and then we were free. Anahi would not see us. We were freer than we expected. 

We checked in in the hotel for the afternoon. I was wearing pants when we came in and a skirt and makeup when we stepped out. 

I see the pictures now. I see the same person I first saw in Mexicali wearing a mask. It was so new and strange. It was... 

I wanted people to see me. I wanted Anahi, and Chevo and Jessica to see how I looked. See me as how I wanted them to know me. I wished for the world to see me and acknowledge me. I was looking for everybody's reaction. 

When we walked down from the hotel to the pizza place there was a psychotic person sweeping the street. "Hello, ladies", he started before talking to himself. People saw us but had no reaction. I couldn't differentiate between being ignored and being normal and therefore not worthy of attention. 

I saw myself before. I didn't ignored me but I knew what were under my clothes. 

We came back to the hotel and spent the afternoon there. 

We got to the plaza and waited a while in the car for the time of the meeting to come. We were talking. It was different to the week before when I was there with the dress and Catherine was holding my hand. Both of us felt different. It was more comfortable. 

We were so lost in the sweetness of the day until Catherine asked "Is she Monica?" There was a girl walking with her boyfriend. We only saw her back. Was she? Who cared? I wanted to be there I wanted to be seen with Catherine. She would see me dressed like this, with a smile formed in my red lips and my black eyes full with happiness. I hoped she were her. 

And Jessica and Chevo walked then and I forgot it. 

Jessica had a serious face, irritated. Was I the reason? Maybe my presence was unpleasant. No. She had just a headache with nausea. We would talk later in the starbucks and she would be ok. People looked at me but there were no emotions on their faces. I was just somebody. 

The starbucks closed and we sat in a bench. Chevo told us about his session of the day before after the meeting with Paola. One of the people who were in the bench next to us came to where Catherine and I were seated. 
"Excuse me, girl, could you take a picture of us?" I turned because I was in the edge. At first I thought she was talking to Catherine. Her eyes were set on my and her phone placed on my hands. I had no time to answer. 

They laughed. "Take several", someone said as they were placing themselves. I took five or six. Everyone's eyes were set on me. They were looking to her phone which was in my hands which were just in front of my face. I extended her phone back to her and she asked me if I took just one or a couple. I didn't want to speak. I knew my voice would betray me. I knew it would sound as deep and low as an animal it would be growl and I'd be betrayed. I drew the word with my lips and made a gesture with my hand. 

"What happened?" asked Catherine with them smiling on her back. "Nothing, I just took them a picture". "It's 10:41 and this theme of conversation just ended" 

We were under the stairs of the movies, we had just bought food for the movie. Chevo and Jessica met with somebody he knew. They introduce their girlfriends. Catherine and I stood apart. How could I introduce myself? Would I say Ivan? Would let them? Or would Catherine save me? How could I interrupt them with a name they don't even know? 

Catherine saw somebody known, too. 

She was the one who would see her first. "With my luck, she will be here. And she will be in the same theater and just sitting next to us. We were just worried about seeing someone known, about me being recognized. Of course she will be the one. Everything has to always fit" 

"She was Monica" She had color on her lashes. She waved her hand and smiled excitedly. It was a fake one like all the ones I'd seen before from her side. He was now in the place I used to be. I had thought about her seeing me, recognizing me. What about him? 

"Awkward moment" Jessica said. 

We were just going to enter to the theater. A line was formed outside of the entrance and I was leading the way. I saw him standing at the end of the line. I had to be seen now. What has she told him? What has she told her family? What did she just say when they passed by? "Do you see that person? she's my ex boyfriend" 

He was alone. The restrooms were in straight ahead and the line of people passed him by. He was just by my side as I clutched Catherine's hand and like a 5 year old child shut my eyes to not be seen. 

Before the start of the movie, they would enter from that same door and climb the stairs. They were seated 5 or 6 rows in front of us. I didn't saw them after the movie. I didn't want to see her, know of her again. 

I searched her facebook for a post, as if in her picture I would be able to see her thoughts of seeing me there. What did she see? What did he? 

How did I look? Why do I care? 

Why do I keep caring? 

I was going to tell Chevo and Jessica, but couldn't. Catherine asked me if she wouldn't ruin my day. She didn't. 
No, she didn't, did she? 

Today I was at her house. We saw the movie. The first half of it. We both were wearing the mountain dew shirts as we laid on the couch with her dog beneath us. She would come to us and stand by our legs. The dog that once bit me and barked at me furiously now came to me and let herself be stroked. Has she seen me differently, too? 

Her parents came and saw us. Her father told her that there were no chips to offer me. Just as I arrived to her house he was leaving to go see their mechanic. He called her a little after asking her if she needed something else from the Oxxo. 

Her father doesn't know about me nor her. Her father just knew that her daughter's boyfriend, Ivan, was with her. Her mother do knows about us, but yet she still see us as Catherine and Ivan. I don't know how she sees me. I don't know if she thinks I'm her boyfriend, too, or something complicated. 

When would I imagine it? Will they know some day? Would they treat me the same? Would they ask us, girls, if we wanted something to eat? Would they see me as Sofia, her daughter's girlfriend? Would some day my own family see her as their daughter's girlfriend?

"If you want him to trust you, you have to trust him first"

I dreamed something today. What was it? I remember the school and being mistaken a lot. Being called a girl and referred as a she. I exited, for some reason, Vinicio's class. He asked me how he hadn't seen me. Catherine was talking with him as I returned. I went to the bathroom in  a bike. I got it inside the building without seeing the note which forbid it. The principal or someone like that was just passing by with different important people. "Who left this here?" I heard. I was in the men bathroom. Why would I be in the women's? I am a man, after all. Now it was different. I was a man and everybody saw me as a woman. 

"Oh, she has come out of the bathroom." someone observed as I pleaded forgiveness and asked for my bike back. 

Garab waved me bye when I exited in my bike from the faculty. He pointed my colored bracelet like the day before when I was awake. 

He had seen it. I wore it all day. Nobody but him see it. No. Not a single person pointed out, but I don't know how many saw it. Another of the things that I can't and won't ever know. 

We were in the movies and Chevo was talking about the day before. I never realized until Catherine pointed out. Now I can't tell yesterday from the rest of the past. When was it that I was in Catherine's house? I was wearing the mountain dew t-shirt. The white bra underneath could be noticed and yet I didn't gave a single care. I was in just the t-shirt lying with her on her couch. Her mother and father were there and I remained as exposed as the rainbow on my wrist. 

Would I still be wearing it if instead of the gay rainbow were the trans colors? A mixture of white, blue and pink. Would I show it more to the world? Would I like it more? 

I guess I do. If I didn't, I wouldn't had mentioned it to Catherine. 

I could had gone today to her house. We could had worked in the spreadsheet I wanted so much to finish yesterday. My family and I went to the United States instead. I already bought shoes last week. I bought a sweater and couldn't dare to wander around the women section. Why did I want to go now? What was so important for me to go that I postponed doing what I wanted with the person I wanted? 

We broke fast and I talked. I talked about my future. What I wanted, what I liked. The things I enjoy. The cashier with long hair recognized me from the time before. "Nice hair, bro" he had said that time. "I have it long, too", as he showed his tied bun. 
"Did you cut your hair?", he said when I finished giving my order. 

I shook my head to answer and show him the curls. Later in Ikea I would see the other person I recognized. Was that person trans? I saw their long hair, too. It was tied in a long ponytail. The eyebrows were thin and clean, the care of somebody's hand's work was seen in them. I remember the first time I saw that worker. I can recall the moment but not the distance from now. How was I? Was it when I was looking for my bed? Was then when I was in so much pain that I could barely sleep? Was I seen in that person? What was in that smile today that I remembered? A lady got near when their delicate hands moved graciously putting the yellow bags in the basket. How do people gender that person? I don't remember hearing their voice. Was that cashier the one which checked us? 

I could see the black points that scream in my own face. Maybe that's why I'm so afraid to gender them. I know the pain of the doubt dissolving in people's eyes. Would that person care? Maybe I am offending them avoiding giving an answer. They were not wearing a bra. Their clothes were slim and their jeans normal. There was nothing. Maybe nobody but me notices it. Maybe it's all just in my head. 

Again my mother talked with Luis. They talked about the pictures they found. I couldn't take it anymore. I was trembling with rage. I was mad. I put myself in his place. What would happen if it were me instead? They found porn in my laptop. No. My father saw the pictures of me wearing a skirt. He told my mother and they both call me to their bedroom. They ask me those questions. Why did I wear that? What was my motivation and reason? Why? When? Why? 

Every question like a punch would torture me. How can I lie? How can I escape? Every question, every pull, every throb of pain pushes me away, makes it more impossible for me to talk. I drown, the water fills my lungs as I try to scream for help and air. Every gasp of air kills me more.

"What you're doing is wrong" I finally tell her and catch my breath. 

We talked and she cries again. She feels her sons so far away. Why can't we trust her? Why won't we open up? 

I explain my own reasons when I talk for Luis. "He'll do it whenever he's ready. He has a right to keep his own secrets." 

"They are women's", he says when I grab the box for my father to say as if I didn't know. "Are you buying woman's shoes?" he confirms the obvious incredulous. "He's buying woman's shoes" he shares the truth with my father. He appears to deny it. 

I get up and walk upstairs. I see him seating in the last steps looking down, hiding in the darkness he's so scared of. 

"Did you hear what we talked about?", I plan to ask him when I open up to him.

"Ivan Fernandez has updated her profile picture"

What is this that I am feeling right now? I feel something deep in my chest. It's heavy and dark. I see the color black. No, a purplish brown. 

"You are free to go and see whomever you want. If you feel that the results aren't what you want or that there are not changes enough, you are free to go". 

Am I really? Next session I can talk about the movie. Being seen, the girl who saw me and asked me for favor, Chevo, Jessica; Monica and her boyfriend. I have a lot to talk about. Luis and my mother. I want the hormones. I can't keep still. I feel so much energy inside of me that's burning. I have to move and do something. I had a glimpse of happiness and I can't ignore it. Is it really happiness or is it a trap? 

He warned me that this that I'm feeling is something that everybody goes through when they're changing. 

Three weeks have passed since the last time I spoke a word to her. Just two more weeks of classes and then university is gone. Where will I  go next? What will I do? Whom will I be? 

I went to Catherine's house today. I worked in the spreadsheet and watched an episode of Black Mirror in her couch. Her dog doesn't bark to me no more. She comes when I call her name. She lets me rub her. "What did you do to her that she likes you a little more?" 
"You like me now, and she knows it". 

What is the thought that sneaks trough my mind? What is that darkened image that gives me goosebumps? 

I can't concentrate right now. I can't think of something to write. It's like there is an interference that blocks every flowing of images and feelings. A blockage somewhere, an emergency system that shuts and an alarm blares. 

I saw the trailer, was it yesterday? The Danish Girl. Barack Obama will make an event where he'll show that movie and episodes of the series Transparent. For a long time I avoided everything related to that. No, that's not true. I looked for those themes. I remember memorizing the intro of the episode in Pokemon where Ash and his friends enter this new city and the camera looks from under their faces as they feel overthrown by the magnitude of the buildings. That episode was the one where Ash has to dress in a pink dress and pretend to be a girl so he can battle the gym leader. I did not look for that episode. I did not recorded or even watched it more times than the rest of them. I just remembered that intro because there was something in there that kidnapped my attention. 

Sakura cardcaptors. I never followed that anime. Just one episode I remember where they are in a gender-bending play. I liked and felt embarrassed at the same time for watching the anime Ranma 1/2. A young man who fell in a cursed bath. A redheaded girl had drowned in there. Now every time that he was wet with hot water he transformed in a redheaded girl. 

I remember being a child and watching a movie lying in my bed. It was night and everyone was asleep. I repeated the part of the movie where the little boy had to pretend to be a girl. There is a pattern in all those memories. Was I really so oblivious? No. I knew there was something there. I knew and was ashamed. I liked the games I played with Jessica but never asked her. I was ashamed when Edgar passed by and looked at us. I was scared somebody could look at me and see through my head. I had to hide, hide everything, every wish and feeling. I put on a mask to show the world. I was always the serious boy, the calm kid, the smart child. 

I was what everyone wanted from me because I knew I could never be what I wanted for myself. 

I never disliked the changes of puberty. I ignored them. Maybe looking like a man I'd feel different? No. I'm putting thoughts and feelings in my past. I did ignored them. I never cared. 

I was always scared of injections. I was scared for a whole year for a single vaccine. Now, I'll need bloodwork if I want the treatment. I remember thinking I'd deny a live-saving treatment if it involved the use of syringes. Is hormones treatment life saving? Why don't I care anymore? Why do I want it more than anything? It's not really life-saving for me. I won't die if I don't start it. 

It will allow me to really live. It's not life-saving but life-giving.

"I feel like wearing a dress or something very girly" 

I know I dreamed something. I can't remember but I do recognize the sensation of losing a known world. 

I've wrote a new tweet yesterday from the alternate Twitter. Only two people follow me, only two know my existence. Why do I post things? I feel like a scream in an empty room where nobody can hear me. Isn't this what that is? Screaming and moaning where nobody at all knows it? 

What did we do today? Catherine came for me. I didn't shave. I could but decided not to. I used the electric razor. Why? Tomorrow Catherine will come, too. She told me she'd drive me all week. "Thursday you'll go to therapy... well, we can see it then, but the rest of the week." She drove us to her therapy. I waited outside. "Thanks, son", she said after I told her something. She has to call me just as everybody. I don't know what Catherine has told. Using another gender would mean breaking the confidential agreement with Catherine. Whatever Catherine talks about in there has to stay there. What happened then the first day I went? She used the feminine. Did she know it was me? Who I were? Was it a lapsus? 

Today we did enter to Vinicio's class. He saw a patient and then asked for observations. I participated. I opened my mouth and let a little view of inside my thoughts for everybody to see. That's what he wanted. He talked about assignments, exceptions, positive connotation. What would he tell me? Rene told me I could go with whomever I wanted wherever I wanted. I don't want a therapist anymore. I do need one, it would absurd to say otherwise. I need a doctor, an endocrinologist. Someone who can fix my body and not my mind. 

Jhonny gave us a survey from one of his friends. It was a market study about craft beers. Catherine and I know a little about them but we do drink them sometime. Edgar brews them. There were no difficult questions. It surprised me they hadn't asked about my age or my gender. Those questions didn't come until the second page. They were some of the last ones. I skipped the gender one. Why do they care? Does it make a difference? Yes, it does. It has a use to know if men or women are the ones who prefer them or which types are most bought by who or what gender goes to which places. It's not that they don't need the information, it's that I don't know what they want from me? Either I lie to them or I lie to myself. 

I finished and kept the sheet. The sun was blinding me and I used it to cover my eyes. I did see some things. I heard some of the words they were speaking. I followed some of the session that was happening in front of the class. I looked to the sheet of Catherine. It used to be a secret shared by both of us. Two years ago we both had to expose about transvestism. We hadn't have done it yet but we were partners in that crime. I felt safe in her company. She helped my carry some of the guilt and the shame. As time went by, our paths drifted apart. Now I am not alone in the way she's still by my side. I do am alone carrying this secret. She has her own and hers is different to mine. To her, it's a big and heavy weight to carry. Mine, to me, is the biggest and cruelest burden anybody could ever imagine. 

She's thanked me just now about me being there for her, listening, asking questions, staying whenever she cries. Has she forgotten how she was there for me as well? My world, my reality, my self broke in front of my eyes and she stayed there to help me pick up the pieces. I don't deserve her thanks. After she listened and asked and stayed and held my hand I left on her birthday to never come back. I transformed on my stay there. I changed and was never the same. Sure, I wasn't the April she was getting used to like, nor the Sofia she thought I had left behind. I came back as a shadow of what I was supposed to be. I wore the mask of a phantom. 

"I'd never gave it a thought. I didn't say good bye to him".

"They will suffer a lot" "He studied  psychology, that's the reason" 

It wasn't Anahi's birthday today and yet we gave her a present and a card. We bought the snoopy cup and a XV year old card. We changed some things and decorated it. I wrote something for her after Catherine did it. "Do you have a picture with Anahi?" I sent her one from Halloween. Why Halloween? Was it the last time we saw us or was it the only time I've showed her my real self? 

Real self, those fucking words make me sick. I'm tired of writing and saying that melodramatic bullshit. I want to scream. I have only one self, I am one single person. I may be sick and broken but that is who I fucking am. I'm tired of drowning in this self-deprecating pit of sadness and cliche words. Why am I angry? 

Did I take my life-pills? My death-pills. I did. Only one but they'll last me. I'll ask my father for money tomorrow. 

She wants to live alone. She liked being alone and needing anyone. Even if we went to the capital for a postgraduate scholarship, after returning she'd wish to live on her own. It hurt me but I can't pinpoint where exactly. I'd like being alone, living alone. I don't mind. Even then, I was scared of being on my own as how I want to be. Be it DF or Vienna, I was scared of not being with her. After she said that, after hearing Zayra talk about her age and the time she left after studying  and deciding to stay and do something else, I lost that fear, I decided to go. 

She talked how to her was doing a change. She's seen herself always doing what's next, to her, staying and looking for a job is changing the pattern. Maybe that's how it is to her, but to me, it's the other way around. 

To me, looking for a job, postponing the master and staying in my father's house living this life, that, for me,  is keeping doing the same. That's avoiding what I want, starting the path of what I want to do, who I want to be. 

We went to the Castro-Limon foundation. A child's oncology hospital. We had a talk with the child psychologist director of the psychooncology department. Types of grief in children. What is for a kid to know he will die? What is for a little boy to lose his big sister? What is for a parents knowing their girl won't live to reach her teenage years? 

The receptionist talked in the feminine form. I was a man beside women. The psychologist kept using the masculine one, the neutral one. Everytime I am in a group of women and they talk in the neutral one it's because of me. They change their way of talking after seeing me, noticing me. I am the reason we stop being a group of women. I am the one who changes the whole group. Every "guys" comes with a look to my own eyes. 

We entered in pairs to see the aisles. We tied our hair and wore cover-mouths. There were kids playing with the other psychologist. One was in a wheelchair and the other one was seated. 

We talked after Anahi's session. We went to the coffee besides the Chinese place where we ate. We sat in the second floor. Again, like Halloween, the barista said "welcome girls", when Catherine and Anahi were in front. I was hiding behind their femininity. Did he look at me? No, nobody does, when they do the group changes and we transform in the neutral form. 

Her mother and brother knows about me. Until we were on the way home did I ask her. "Did you tell Isaias about me?" 
"Yes... I should tell him the next session, do you remember the girl who was beside me, yeah, that's the one"

Catherine cried yesterday after I asked her about going to sleep. We stayed out of my house talking in her car. What were we talking about? Something she's hiding. What is she so scared to show that wants to cover with titles? Why is she so scared of evaluations? What is she hiding behind the false unmet expectations of being a bad student? 

She cried and everything that I moved trembled. 

"'It should be the other way around', I saw myself talking about my mother being the child and me not taking my own place."

I always told her I wouldn't come back from Spain. Even in the assignment from Humanistic theories, I couldn't see a future returning from Spain. Even Yolanda feared I would killed myself there, I would die and never came back. 

I did. Ivan died there and never returned. His future ended.

"I don't know, it seemed funny to me and her"
"Girls, is this seat taken?" 

I couldn't woke up today. It's hard, I feel tired. The day has ended and I still need to make the report from last week.  I heard the door and their voiced. He entered to my room but I can't remember what was the reason he used to come in. He interrupted a dream. I remember the scene and it's like the room is dark, like my eyes are watered and I cover myself in the shelter of my sheets. I was not sad. I had no reason to be sad, nothing has happened. 

Yesterday I saw them. Catherine and Anahi. I did send her a message. "Thank you for opening up to us, I really liked seeing you. You looked pretty, I don't think I told you". Catherine would ask me later if we talked. No. We didn't. I sent her a message but it was nothing. She answered it today in the afternoon. Or was it earlier? Anahi asked her if she got angry with the status she wrote on her phone. She had. 

Anahi talked about me in the feminine form. Why does it feel weird? Why is it still so strange? I wasn't in the conversation. I wasn't there and it was something I wasn't supposed to read or know. I can understand it from Catherine. Anahi still stumbles with it. It's not the first time it's happened. Liliana and her talked in the same way. Carlos,too. Whenever she talks with Miguel she doesn't use that name. Does he? He sees me as a man. Does Anahi sees me as a girly man? A feminine man with a wish to be treated as one of them? Is the name a nickname and a way of treating me? Why does it seem so demeaning? It ever borders to pathetic. But that's what it is. A wish. 

I had thought about saying it, mentioning it with Chevo and Jessica. I considered saying the name and explaining more to Paola. "Just so you don't think they are preferred". It's easier to tell her. No, it's not. It's the same. I just want to use the excuse of not having a time to tell them. 

I saw them before the movies. I was wearing a skirt and make up. I got called "girl". I had the time, the opportunity, the atmosphere. Everything was there just for me to make use of it. I let it escape. 

Why does it scare me? Why did I prefer to send a text message to Rene cancelling next session instead of calling him? I was scared. I was scared of dialing and waiting for him to pick up. What would I say next after his "yes?". How would I introduce myself. I am scared of meeting a new psychologist or seeking a doctor. It was easier "making up" a motive, a problem. How will I introduce myself? Who am I? 

Should I say "Ivan"? He asked me how I wanted to be referred in session. I took his offer. How could I say Ivan, then? How could I say Sofia? Am I her? Am I me? What if he laughs? What if he gets confused? What if I am wrong? 

How can I go to a doctor and ask for pills? That's what scares me, not the pills, not their effects, not the taking them. I'm afraid of asking for them. I want to be offered. I want him to take them and put it in my hands, to wave them in front of me just as he did with the antidepressants and the name, just as Anahi asked me how should she refer to me after I mumbled and said some empty rambles, just as I am waiting for Chevo and Jessica to give it to me, too. 

If I talk, if I ask, they might say no. Monica said no. Monica left. Monica is gone. Ivan is gone, too. I killed him and sent her away. It sometimes is weird to look at the picture in the shelf over my books. The gift she gave me for one of my birthdays. There's a picture of her in a grey dress besides me. She's small and smiling. My arm surrounds her and I'm bigger with a bigger smile. They are both strangers. They are both part of a past that is no more. I see them and it feels like a foggy dream from which I just woke up, an image that will dissipate and get lost in oblivion.

"It's not that I won't like it's that I won't make it. ...I WON'T MAKE IT!" 
"I don't what to say to someone who feels so alone." 
"I'm scared that I won't make it either. The difference is that mine is not just a master, I can't reapply again or pick another one. If I failed I have no other choice." "How would you not make it?" "I don't know, failing to have somewhere to live, to find a job, being discriminated, pointed at, screamed at, assaulted, raped, killed." 

I cried like I used to do in her car. This time wasn't exactly the same. This time it hurt. This time I could feel every little prick of the pain. I let it hugged me. Its darkness covered me and I felt its hotness. I was burning and let the flames go through me. I cried more and the tears flowed as my body was evaporating leaving nothing but my fragile being. 

I drove in the morning to the hospital. We would meet there. The teacher and the patient were supposed to arrive half an hour after of Catherine did. I was the first. The guard saw me and let me in with a "champ" and a "sir". He used to use only one. He flirted innocently with Catherine. She was the prettiest woman who had entered that day. "He was in a good mood" she explained. 

The patient and her mother were not there. The teacher didn't arrive either 15 minutes after the meeting time. 

There was other thing different from today's morning. I shaved like I use to do. Did I shave my chest or was it yesterday? I combed and tied my hair. I took the angry birds bag out of my underwear drawer.  

Did it change how I looked? Was it anything different in me? The guard saw the same person he always does. 

An hour and the patient wasn't there. We talked with the professor. I didn't know she is Colombian. I never imagined. 

She was kind and nice to us. She shared with us her story. Why do I feel the need to convince myself I'm not in any doubt with here. I don't have to share this secret of mine with her. I don't have to tell anybody, if I do, it's because I want to. 

She offered to give us a ride. "See you later" she said. We didn't return. I left my car in law's faculty's parking lot. Catherine drove us to Playas. Dax. She would buy some things. I wanted a lipstick. It's the only thing I was missing. I was wearing make up when I got in. I wore make up all day. Did anybody notice? Nobody has said anything. Does that mean something? Would they? 

I bought one and tried after returning from Argana. It had little sparkles in its color. My lips were pink and shiny. I hated it. I saw the shinning spots of the drag queens' dresses and make up. I felt sick. That's not what I am, this is not who I am. I ask for one of the wipes Catherine had bought and cleaned myself. She liked it. She didn't saw me like that. "You didn't look like that, I liked it, but I understand what you felt." 

Catherine drove us back to school. We had to be in the theater by 4 and a half. The white polos were in the back seat. One men medium and a women large. Catherine hadn't tried any of them before. I put mine, the man's, over my pink t-shirt, then, over that, my gray sweater. 

I accompanied her to the bathroom in the computer lab so she could change. I offered her several times to change t-shirts. Mine was bigger and looser. I am a little slimmer than her. Mine might fit her better. 

She denied my offers and came out of the bathroom looking fine. I was disappointed, more than that, I was envious. 

The ceremony was nothing special. We took pictures and smiled. We laughed and sang the stupid hymn of the school. We're done. We're almost out. It's so close to the end I can't really believe it. 

The last day of classes will be the tuesday 8th. "You won't go to school after that?", asked my father when I told him. "When is your graduation?" he continued. "Do you know what you'll do after? ... after school?" 

"Yes". Yes, now I do know exactly what I'll do. I'm just scared of all of it.

"Girls, would you help me filling this survey about the service, in a minute I'll come back to receive from the both of you" 

It's been 27 days of this month. The streak today will reach 27, tomorrow will be four weeks. Four weeks will be the time until they'll tell us our results. 

I dreamed about Monica. She said his name and I left the room. Why does it matter? I didn't care, did I? Miguel, from grade school was the one who asked me how I was. She mentioned him but I offended her. I criticized her point of view. I couldn't remember when I told Catherine about my dream, I recall even less. 

I dreamed with Monica I had written. I deleted the word and corrected myself. I don't dream with her, I dream about her. In my dreams I construct an image of my perceptions made of her memories but she's not here nor there. She's somewhere. 

Again I thought about her. I was driving home. At first, when I started redacting this sentenced I feared that it was at the same time when I was chatting with voice messages with Catherine. Now, it was with her. She wasn't besides me but even in the distance she accompanied me. 

No, I hadn't started yet. Why did I think of her? What was it? 

"If we talked, if she had stayed, if we were friends still" I remember now. I had just left Catherine outside of her car in the hotel. In the recess we had slept in there and talked about tomorrow. Could I wear the dress? Maybe the sweater... why do I feel the need to look like that again? 

My car stopped just stepping out of the porche. I tried turning it on several times and before the fifth I could go. I didn't want to drive. It was better for me to leave now that it was night and raining. Later could we go somewhere. 

So I remembered the last time I were outside dressed like that. It was the day of the movies. Chevo and Jessica were with me. They said nothing but a girl had seen me like a woman. The did say something but I didn't continued the theme. They weren't the only ones who saw me. Monica did. I wanted to know. What did she think, what did she see? Did he see me, too? Does he know? Did he asked her something? Why do I care? 

Why do I care so much? A little part of me, a naÃ¯ve part of me, hoped the next day I'd receive a message from her trying to mend things up. "You looked nice", "You surprised me", " I didn't expect to see you there". Something, anything. A question a comment, some words with a little message folded inside with an apology and the regret of letting the things like they were. 

I think that was what kept hurting me. Reminding myself that no matter how much I try to fool myself, I still care and miss her. 


I don't know what to write next. It was the EGEL, the titulation exam. I started to get worried yesterday. I hadn't studied or cared. What if I wasn't as ready as I thought? What if I ended up with a mediocre score? I won't fool myself thinking I'll fail it. It would really surprise me, but part of me really hopes to get honorific mention. I didn't want to study, to really try. It would hurt a lot more to try and fail. 

I didn't really expect it to be so easy. I saw the questions from the guide and they were difficult, confusing. The ones in the test were clearer, easier. The first section was familiar, the last one was almost a joy. I like those subjects. I enjoy the numbers and the methodology. 

I fantasized about getting the medal, the comment in the graduation, a mention, anything. Maybe somebody who did study will get it. I didn't really try the last semesters. It would be kind of unfair to me to win. Although it us unfair on its own how I have to earn a greater score just because of who I am. Most of them didn't know me a year ago. Now they asked questions. I looked like some kind of expert. What do they see in me that gives them that idea? What do they see? 

What do everybody see in me and why do I want to know so much?

 Three days till the end of the month. Then one week and classes will be over. I don't know yet how should I feel or how will I do anyway. 

I don't want to think about school. That's why the chapter of the project is still undone and the analysis incomplete. Why I haven't started the exposition of Monday. I want to drink today. Even that, I don't feel like drinking. I don't want the alcohol in my body, that's not the sensation I'm looking for. I want to go out like that Thursday. I want to wear those kind of clothes and walk and be seen. I want to feel the nervousness of being looked at, the fear of being exposed, the joy of them using the right way of addressing me and even the pain of  them thinking they got it right. 

I want that. I knew I would even before I started. I feared I would get addicted. I am afraid now. Will it stop when someone gets rude or aggressive? What will happen when someone confronts me? When a known person meets me and asks questions or when a group of kids look and start laughing and recording? Will I stop? Will I bury these feelings and try to burn everything as I'm wearing it and kill the burns in a deep pool of melancholy? Will I want it still? Will I want it even more? 

Why do I prefer to think about that? Why do I long to have those thoughts of pain and misery? Why can't I focus instead on the times I smiled, the times I couldn't even believe were happening? 

I woke up in the dark morning. I fell asleep earlier than usual and woke up at 3 in the morning. I covered myself in the sheets and turned sides exiting and entering from different dreams. It was like a revolving door where inside was my own mind and the outside were reality. I was trapped in a moving circle where I'd see the fantasy of the dream my unconscious was creating and then catch a glimpse of the familiarity of reality. 

I'd remember things that have never happened and then others which did. 

I ran out of thoughts. I don't want to stay in those of always. Why should I always write about the same things? Why do I keep coming back to the usual, when it's not Monica and how much I either hate her or miss her, is my own body or mind, then I talk about Catherine and her own path and the way she helps me and makes me laugh and cry. All is how I can't believe, I can't believe how Monica left, I can't believe how can I still miss her, I can't believe how much I want Catherine, I can't believe how people can see me as a woman, I can't believe how I told my mother or Anahi, I can't believe how I haven't told Chevo and Jessica yet. I can't believe how much all of this hurts and  I can't believe how happy I am other times. 

It's like if I've always been in the same bubble surrounded by the same reality. Now that it's burst I can't believe a different things. I haven't gotten used to the things that the world can offer or throw at me. 

I just remembered I haven't took my pill. My life-pill, my death-pill. The happy-pills and melancholy-pills. 

Anahi hadn't known I'm taking medication. She was surprised. I thought yesterday about her reaction and her face. It was surprise alright, but there were other things there. Was there fear? Emotion? Disbelieve? Why was she surprised? She couldn't believe it I'd do it? Is it something that makes it real or something that she never thought I'd do? Maybe is something that she should had seen before. 

What would it mean I had started taking hormones? I started with the change. I started changing reality. Am I not ready? Is she not? 

Had she notice some changes that would make her believe I started already? Has my body changed and look different? 

"I should say the next session: 'you saw the girl who was next to me, yeah, she is'". Would someone recognize me like that? Would anyone really connect my own image with the word girl? Why do I forget all those times? 

"You look like a woman" 
"Oh, you? I had seen you but thought you were a woman"
"Lady, could you take a picture of us?"
"Excuse me, girls, would you help me with this questionnaire about our service?"

"They look just a little red. Say you are cold when you enter" 
"Excuse me, do you have your id's?" 

We went out like we were supposed to. I stayed outside her house until midnight. We both did. We talked and cried. I made her cry. This time it wasn't because I said the right thing. I made her cry like I was used to. What happened in our night out? Before that. My father went out with my brother to his thing in school. I was in pajamas when they left. I had already told them I would go out. They knew. I didn't have to ask for permission or explain anything. I had just finished yesterday the most important test of my life. My father offered to give me a ride. I denied it but gave no reason. I didn't mind not drinking. The purpose of the night wasn't to drink. I was going to be intoxicating with a different kind of vice. I would get drunk with the looks of strangers. There was just one thing I hadn't planned. How would I get out? I was going to wear the red sweater with black leggings underneath. Catherine would lend me a pair of hers. Should I get out with the make up done? My face painted but my body covered with a familiar disguise? The big sweater and the painted face would be too much. I started covering the physical mask when I looked straight to the mirror and got scared. It was too much. They would notice. My father hadn't arrived, my brother and my mother were on their room. I had to leave before they got it. It was 10 minutes till my estimated time of leaving. I got my things ready and went out. The lights were off. The first floor was complete empty. 

As I stepped out the door my dad's black pick up was blocking my way out. I raised my hand and pointed to the car. He understood without seeing me completely. I got in and left. I had to stop a couple of blocks ahead. I didn't send a message to Catherine. I had neither data nor credit. Besides buying gas I had to stop in the oxxo, too. I took my shirt and undershirt off. I was in just my bra when a group of kids were walking towards my car. It was 6 in the afternoon and yet it was completely dark. I put on the sweater and took off before they reached me. 

A lot of people saw me. I don't know what they really saw. Did people see a girl, a boy dressed as one, someone or me? Which of them am I? Do they really see? 

I asked for credit and gave my telephone. My voice is a traitor. Is a coarse and poisoned razor that scratches my throat as it leaves my lips. 

Even in silence, even before I mouth a single word they've noticed before. Does the paint changes a thing? Do clothes? 

What was it that made the Carl's jr worker said what he did? 

There is a doubt in people's eyes. I ignore what doubt really means. They don't know if I'm a man or a woman. They get mistaken and correct themselves because they're not sure. Because they are not sure they can get convinced. 

If they can get convinced why did the lady in the sex shop looked at my severely? Why did she try to cover her own sight? Why the fuck do I care? 

Catherine forgot her wallet. She had neither money nor id. How could we drink without an id? I hadn't really thought about that. They never had asked for it before in those places. In zenzontle they didn't. There were just women working that night. One of them offered us the samples for us to pick one. I opened my mouth and spoke. I couldn't see what her eyes exposed about herself. Did she know? They don't use gender talk. In spanish where every other words conveys gender I couldn't get an idea of what they see. What does it matter? Does it make a difference if they know what I hide between my legs even though they don't say or do anything? Why does their knowing hurt me? 

In the second bar the woman there did ask us. Catherine told the truth and stood up. The two of us left before she said anything. What would have happened if Catherine would have had it with her? She would had given it to her and it would later be my turn. Would she notice the name or just look at my picture? Would she confirm what she already knew? Would it give her permission to say something hurtful? Would she discover something she hadn't imagined? Or did she asked them because of me? 

We saw the movie. We sat there in the last row. We were behind what's-her-name and her boyfriend. One of them couldn't find their tickets. Would she had recognized me if she had turned? Would she had seen through me? 

When the movie ended Catherine wondered if the girl in the last row was her friend. She stood and looked and wondered. I was upset with that but said it until we were outside her house. I hurt her with what I answered to her comment. "Would you let your dad see me like this? Would you mind if I step out and say hi?" 

She forgot her id. She forgot her wipes. I made it seem like me having to enter my house like this were her fault. It's something she feels bad about. I brought it up. It hurts me but why? 

I had the wrong idea. No, things have changed. I liked that people knew about me. I liked that she told Carlos and Miguel and Yarely and everybody else. Now I didn't want Vania to know. I didn't want her to know I am "her boyfriend", I am "Ivan, the weird boy, the faggot, the crossdresser". 

That's what I am to everybody who knows me. It doesn't matter what the strangers see. There is not a past for them to tie me to. 
The people who do know me, be that girl from high school or her friend or Miguel or Chevica or Yarely or my mom or her mom. To them I am and always will be Ivan. 

Even if I let them see me, even if I take the mask off, all they will ever see is my old mask covered in my true face.

"I can have a birth certificate with my real name that says I'm a woman" 

"Are you the doctor's secretary?" 
"Could you tell my next patient I'll be out in a minute?, thanks, son." 

I wrote yesterday about something else. Did I write early? Why wouldn't I mention it? Maybe I did and just don't remember now. 

What was it that made me look up the info? I want to start now. I thought about looking for a group, giving a round there, seeing what's up. I could send an email to the psychologist or doctor who coordinates the group, I could ask for info, a referral, anything. First I had to see what groups met already. Now I remember, there is a group. There is a group of transgender girls. The sexologist of COCUTT talked about it. Yesterday I wanted a bigger picture, so I went into the rabbit's hole. 

I opened the browser in private mode and entered the keywords of my search. Almost all of the results were of erotic nature. Advertising, announcements, soliciting posts looking for traps, shemales, trannys, all those terms which I've learned to hate. Three of them were different from the first page. One was a chronicle of the life of a transexual woman here in Tijuana. The other was a blog post about the situation of the transsexuals in the border. The third I think it was about an interview with the leader drag prostitute in the poorest neighborhood in Guadalajara. 

It wasn't until later pages where I found old news about different clinics here in Tijuana. One of them was from two years ago. The clinic would be inaugurated as the first LGBTI clinic in the state. Cabrales would be the one who would give the medical attention. I, at first, wondered if I'd go with him. I knew then that the clinic didn't exist. There is no clinic now. It's a dead project. It had the life expectation of a headless and limbless fetus. Would I reach out to him? Were I capable? 

I looked another one which is near Catherine's house. Later would I find it's specialized in HIV and AIDS. The articles would show me how the transgender population has one of the biggest risks about contracting HIV. It made sense that its Trans attention were about that specifically. 

I regret now reading those other articles. The United States gives political asylum to the trans women who asks for it. The discrimination is so ingrained in this society that even the cops are one of the biggest assailants. Discriminated in jobs, being arrested out of the segregated zone of whores, forced to undress in front of the other inmates, humiliated, attacked, killed. 

The chronicle about Guadalajara talked about how they are resigned to never get to old age. They are scared less of death than they are of being old. It's a relief to then. Who wouldn't be living in hell? 

Even the most prepared were ignored in job interviews when they saw the discordance between the name of the papers and the image of the person. 

I had already thought about that. That scared me of here. In the United States I know how it's legal to change your name. The people there do it all the time. Here it's not so easy. Your whole identity is linked to that name which is given upon you in your first days of life. 

I really didn't expect what came next. I was scared, I was afraid and nervous. The catastrophic future I had seen when I cried in Rene's office was coming true. I saw my future and I doubted it wasn't worse than death. The impotence clenched my limbs and covered my mouth with its long and black fingers asphyxiating me with my own screams. 

What was it that I remembered? I told Anahi my future was brighter in the capital. There will be a better life for me. There you can change your papers. It's hard but there is a way. I looked for the exception that would tie me to my hell. I searched with all the intention to fail. 

I was wrong. 

It's easier than I could imagine. 

I met with the idea I had. There is a trial, you come in front of a judge and expose your case. You are judged by a doctor and a psychologist, yo go through months of hormones and other series of requisites, jump through some hoops, land in one foot and after paying tens of thousands of pesos, you can have your corrected papers. 

That was the old way. The new way is just 10 labor days, five hundred pesos and you have your corrected birth certificate. There is no amendment, there is no difference. I can have a birth certificate that Sofia Fernandez was born in the 7th of january two decades ago and she's a woman. 

It was unbelievable. It was amazing. It made me smile and cleansed the tragedy that burned my mouth. 

I thought I'd sleep with a smile and wake up as the happiest person on earth. 

Today was just another day.
