"It's the lack of control. I can tell Chevica to start calling me Sofia; I can tell my mother that I am her daughter; I can tell my father. I can't tell yours, be it today or tomorrow or in a few weeks or months. I can't talk about me without exposing you." 

I was going to wear something familiar. I took my brother's shirt to the bathroom with me. I ended up breaking an old sweater's neck as I stretched it. I didn't shave and I did wore make up. Why? A year ago, no, at the start of the semester I was reluctant to the idea of wearing a bra under my clothes. Today I wore make up to all my classes. All but lipstick. Why? Why am I so reckless? How can I be that desperate of being noticed and seen? I want my face to give me away so my mouth can stay shout with my voice and secret kept in silence. 

It was the last class of Vinicio. He told us about the last essay and gave the last speech. Work in what we can, keep studying and don't give up an opportunity even if it's not what we want. A couple of months ago his words would had destroyed me. Now I received them with a smile. How many jobs will I lose because of my condition? No, it's not a condition. It's not a sickness or something I came up with. It's not a flu or a cancer. It's who I am. I remember the fear of being rejected because being a man. How many jobs ask specifically for a female applicant, how many opportunities wasn't I capable of participating because of my genitals? 

Now it's even worse. I am not a man, I am not a real woman; I am not "normal". 

What has happened that gave me this apparent immunity? Is it really? Am I truly OK with the idea or is it just another face of denial? 

Am I again denying what is happening to me? Am I giving a blind eye to my own reality? 

Yesterday we stayed in Catherine's car outside of my house. She had her session and spoke what had she been keeping to herself, to ourselves. She asked me for a break, a rest. I couldn't give it to her. Even now I can't stay immobile I can't stop. How can I be this hypocritical? I want her to share, to talk to her father, I want her father to know about me and I can't talk to my own. 

I am no different to her own mother. "Don't you think is time to release me from this burden?" 

Zayra will give us a second class tomorrow. Suicide will be the theme. It will be a familiar picture. I am a little scared of the workshop of this Friday, of our last day in school, our last time there. 

Anahi would meet us before Vinicio's. 

Did someone notice me? What did they see? To whom do I change for? Who do I want to see me and notice me? 

I can't take those words out of my mind. 

"Paola, I wanted to tell you something before Chevo and Jessica so you don't get any idea of favoritism" 

"Jessica, I remembered how you told me you sometimes didn't do something if they didn't ask you, even though you knew it was something they needed it. I need something from you. You mentioned briefly how Catherine referred to me in the feminine way and it was something I could get from you.  I am going to ask you."

"Chevo, I thinks it's the most difficult for me to open up with men. I feel like I betray them. I don't know or am close with many, but I've been having a hard time getting close to my dad and brothers, and hadn't realized it, but I think it has something to do with the idea of betraying what I thought I was, what I should had been. You and me were the only men in our group of friends. It may sound a little absurd, but I have this feeling that I am letting you behind with what I have to ask you." 

"Johanna, you were one of my closest friends in my time in Europe. I didn't really open up to almost anyone. I am having something so heavy and guarded and I wanted to share it with you." 

"Luis, I have a really good time with you. I like you very much, I love you. I am sorry for not being the big brother you should have had." 

"Dad, I am not a man. I am not your son. 

"Dad, I am trans"

"Thank you, 8th or 9th semester guys, you helped us to gain that 100" 

She walked towards the bathroom and in my memory I'm grasping her hand and letting her guide my steps.  She invited me in, how many times did we talk already of doing this. In our imagination we enter nonchalantly and focused only in ourselves, we are in each other's arms and our lips entwined. This time it was different. We were both in but we were nervous. At least I was. What if somebody saw me? What if a girl would enter and see me? What if instead of a student it were a teacher? We opened the doors and entered each to one stall. The last one was dirty. A thin ribbon of dried blood was marked in the white marble. 

It felt, weird. It's not the first time I've entered in a women's bathroom. 

I am six years old. No, I am five or four. I am a little boy visiting my mother's kindergarden. There are not kids beside me. The school is almost alone. Is it afternoon or a non-school day? I have to go to the bathroom. Yes, there is nobody but us and workers. My godfather is there, too, he is working in the school, cleaning something or doing some manual work. The classrooms are closed. There are no bathrooms open either. Where can I go? Yes, there is one. The girls' restroom is open. A little girl dressed in a colored dress is painted on the door. My mother tells me to walk in and go. I cry. I don't want to. I can keep it in. It doesn't matter. Why don't I want to enter now? What is it that I fear? My mother told me to, there is no other option, there is nobody who'll see me or say anything. Of what am I so afraid that anybody will think? What is it so terrible and devastating that brought me to tears? My mother called him. He came and told me to come in. Nothing will happen to me. He is a boy and he enters. He shows me. Do I see now? He's still a man, nothing has changed. I see them and understand. I am not an idiot. I know I won't lose my penis. I know I will still be a boy. That's why I can't enter. I am not allowed. I am a boy. That's what brought me to tears. I am a boy... 

No. That's the reason I cry now, not then. Then I was a boy, now I am not. 

Sometimes I get really scared that I'm actually brainwashing myself. 

I have to write an essay for Vinicio's class this semester. Last night he sent us the files from which we can pick the one we want. I saw several interesting. A couple of them were about sexuality. The first one I opened was a mexican study from the capital. It explored the difference in emotional reaction to certain stimuli between heterosexual people and transsexual ones. 

I read it complete before falling asleep. I was angry. There was a quote from a ten year old paper which used a categorization of the extremes. Either you were a kid who always know and grew with uncontrollable dysphoria and a heterosexual desire or you realized after the 35 years of old age, had a variant sexual orientation and would later repent your decision to transition. 

Again I was not considered. To other people I was nonexistent. Again I felt invisible. 

I was sad before that. 

Anahi told Catherine after they stopped seeing me on their way home. "Sometimes I say "he" or "Ivan", I don't do it on purpose. I feel bad, it's not my intention to make her feel bad."

"I don't understand how you expect someone to ask you to call them differently. When she presented herself to me as transgender, I understood. 'Oh, ok, then she is a girl', I'd call her the way she identifies." 

"How can they don't know? They are psychology graduates, they are her so-called friends" 


Tomorrow is my second to last day of classes in the University. I don't know how I feel. I won't even go to the campus. I remember the last day of classes in high school. Monica was my girlfriend. No, that's not true. We were not a couple yet. We had kissed. She kissed me. We would wait until the last class when we both would exit school and kiss in the lips before going our different ways. 
I didn't feel anything. People were in the halls, some were in the plaza, there was music I think? I don't remember classes that day. Everyone was sad and emotional. I felt nothing. I was not sad or depressed, not then. I was just uninterested. 

Will the day after tomorrow be like that? 

Tomorrow is my first session as Sofia. Will it be any different? Maybe that's how I'll start. Maybe the whole theme of this new stage will be about changes.

"Welcome (femenine)" 
"Yeah, the phone just shows me the number and I didn't recognized the voice. I actually thought it was a girl" 

Rene was standing behind the door with his hands crossed in front of him. Catherine thought he was waiting for me. I almost rang the doorbell. Catherine stopped me and I hesitated in the time the door opened. He was waiting for a girl in the bathroom to close the door. I didn't understand his words and stopped mid-step as he started speaking. He told me I could go on. Catherine offered to close the door for him. We started. What did I say? 

In the faculty I had to go to the bathroom. We were outside  the Gessel chamber waiting for the professor. I remembered there was a bathroom inside the modules. Again I worried. Where should I go? Men's or women's? I am a men, to every known person that's what I am, how I look. To strangers I would think they see me as a woman, but do they really? 

I woke up early in the morning. This is the last time I'll wake for an early class. There are no more trips to the child's hospital. Today was the last 'sir' and 'champ' from the guard. Tomorrow is the last day of classes. I say it over and over and yet the idea doesn't seem to really sink in. I can't comprehend it totally. 

I am crying and desperate. I am like a little child again in my pajamas with my face all wet in the darkness after I woke up my parents in their room. They are confused and irritated. What happened? This time there is more confusion than anything else. "I need to talk to you. I can't take it anymore. Dad, I am not your son, I am not Ivan. I am sorry, I am sorry. I can't. Please, forgive me" I can't keep the tears in. I spit incomprehensible words and shake uncontrollably. "I am trans, I am sorry". 

Why am I imagining this? 


I wore the leggings without back up jeans. I picked a white shirt and the long red sweater like the first time I wore time outside of my house. Then I would never imagine wearing them inside the faculty. I went like that to the principal building. I didn't know I'd be in the university. I'd see our patient and then my own therapy. The class would be the last thing of our day. 

There was another patient who didn't come. I lost the count of the number of patients that have abandoned me. Do I even care anymore? 

My car got stuck in the first shift. It was failing all the way to Rene's office. I had called him to tell I'd be a little late. The patient didn't arrive but I got a couple minutes later. There was no parking outside of the school. Catherine walked with me. I talked about these last two weeks. I cried talking about my father. I try to protect him. I want to suffer solely the pain instead of giving it to him. 

The class would be in the faculty. We returned there and waited in the middle of the buildings. We stood there in each others' arms. She was in a step that gave her a couple of inches more than me. I could rest my head in her chest and raise my arms to entangle behind her neck. Victor didn't recognized us. He saw us. He saw me but had to hear her before he could realize who we were. 

After returning to the bathroom the girls from the class saw me. They didn't say anything. What could they? 

"The class will be in the room 202 of the 1A building" one classmate said. We went there. We were playing in Catherine's tablet when another one told us the teacher had asked us to bring the television from the other room. "She asked the men to bring it... you, * was just outside, the two of you could go" 

I don't like being noticed like this. I'm a man. I'm strong, stronger than them. Am I really? I didn't ask for it. I don't want it. 

Catherine talked in my defense. "it's big and heavy, and they'd have to go down and then up again, and that's just one way". I ended up not going. 

After class we walked to a japanese restaurant. We ate pizza. I took a picture and shared it. The waiter called us in the feminine form two times. After I spoke he kept it neutral. Did my voice betray me again? 

Is that the reason why I kept singing these last few days? Is that why I keep mocking Catherine, to see if I can fake her voice? 

I never heard myself as I did in the way home. I fooled Rene without trying. 

Why am I so ashamed of trying?

There are four doors in front of me. The first one is cold and gray steel with a black long handle. Beyond it here lies all the images and memories of the fears I had in the four years of my time in the university. The second door is a big and mighty old wooden door. Black metal lashes cover it. It's old and worn and yet it stands strong. It covers all the sad and painful experiences that colored my time in school. The third door is a sliding glass door. It's long and shiny, it's glass but it's not transparent. It stands between me and all the anger and fury, the desperation and frustration that wore me. The last and final door is the simplest. It's a sliding door, too, but it's not big nor cold nor mighty. It's a japanese sliding door, there is a piece of cloth held in a wooden frame; a black ink tree is painted in the white door. Behind it I will find the happy memories given by the moments filled with friendship and love. 


I haven't done any of the things I should have. Yesterday I fell asleep and woke up at the just time I should had to be ready when Catherine would arrive. I showered and shaved my legs. Today I would not shave my face but I did with the electric razor. The dress was ready in my closet. My leg's skin was going to be bare to be touched by her fingers. I put my pajamas when I exited the water-vapor-filled shower space. My knee from yesterday's fall still hurt. I skipped that area with the razor and yet it still burned. Its sting woke me up several times in the night. 

"Welcome [feminine]" The waiter had said to us. He said two times before I spoke. We were exiting the japanese restaurant when I tried to playfully kick her raising my leg behind me. My foot hit her in the buttock but got stuck on its way back in the loose strap of her backpack. I stumbled and fell pulling her down with me. My knee hit the floor and scratched the concrete breaking my own fall. My foot pulled her down and brought her down with me. There was a man working in the garden behind us. I didn't want him to notice and turn. He did. There was another men with a smile losing a couple of teeth laughing all the way to us. I was ashamed and in pain and guilty. We laugh. I didn't care about my bruised knee. 

I wore the red tights I bought with Catherine to wear to the movies. Over them I put the gray dress I bought with her. I apply make up and waited for her to arrive. I wanted to surprise her. I took a couple of pictures but hesitated to send them. I did but she would not see them until later in the day. 

We had sex. We touched each other over our clothes. Then we took them off and touched each other some more. I play with her skin, her lips, the water from between her legs, pushed my fingers inside her and made her lose her breath. She undressed me and teased me. She loves making me beg her to take me. 

We had the last three classes from this semester, from the university, from our careers. Since I was a little boy I knew I'd go to elementary school, and then, when I'd be bigger I'd graduate and go to jr high school. After that, almost being an adult I'd go to high school, that place where I could get a job and have a girlfriend and maybe even have sex. I wouldn't have to wear uniform, sometime there I could even drive to school. After there, I'd finally go to college. I'd study something useful, be a professional, have a degree. After that, after that my life would start. I'd be an adult. I'd be a grown man. 

The classes have ended. Catherine pass to help Katia and talked about herself without any intention. She talked about her dad and cried. Katia would cry, too and open herself to us. I remember last semester about the candles and the technique. I waited a whole semester for this day. I cried like I haven't in a lot. She stood behind me and grasped my shoulder. I took a picture with her. Catherine took it. She hugged me and I hugged her back and smiled. Four semesters I was her student. 

We drank, we took a lot of pictures. We spent four years together. I finished elementary school, I went trough jr high where I started to walk alone, where I felt what sadness felt like, where I'd be home alone and deal with the temptation of sneaking to my parents closet and dress in forbidden clothes, tempting

We drank, we took a lot of pictures. We spent four years together. I finished elementary school, I went trough jr high where I started to walk alone, where I felt what sadness felt like, where I'd be home alone and deal with the temptation of sneaking to my parents closet and dress in forbidden clothes, tempting myself with a cursed fantasy. I graduated lonely and met what I thought were friends in high school. I went through real sadness and inner death. I met Monica and had my first kiss. I had my car and learned how to drive it, how to be alone and independent. I graduated and kissed her while the fireworks illuminated the dark blue sky. I entered the university. Got in and went without knowing anybody. Monica would meet me my first day of courses. I'd meet real friend. I'd feel real loneliness. I'd go to the sierra and camp under star-filled night. I lost Monica and lost myself. I made my dream come true. I was trully alone in a whole different country where no one there knew my full name. I discovered myself with my best friend, I turned her from a friend to a lover to a stranger and then all the way back to my girlfriend. I finished all my classes. I finished all school. I am an adult but I'm not a grown man.

I have grown but I'm not a man. 

And finally, I am ok with that. 


...

I am in Mexicali, in the house of my uncle and aunt. I read the journal article for the essay of Vinicio. I brought my laptop with me. I read the one I had downloaded before for Zayra. It's a case study of dealing with grief with the Solution Centered Brief Therapy. I had picked the other one I read when he sent us the different articles. The first and only one I opened was a neuropsychological study about the difference in dealing with emotions between heterosexual people compared with a transsexual sample. 

It was a simple and not very representative study. It was poor. I could do something better. I want to do something better. I could criticize it easily in five pages. I could write the wrong focus of seeing them with a disease. What's the problem really they have about feeling as the wrong sex? That we have. 

I am part of that group. Maybe that's the reason I hesitated to do that one. Maybe that's why I chose the other one, even though it was longer. I don't want to write about something so personal. Maybe I couldn't study something that personal. 

Yesterday the midnight caught up with me. It interrupted me and block my writing. I haven't checked if I could delete the cut thought. I continued it the first minutes of the day. It's up here with me. I shared it with Catherine. 

"It feels weird: 'friend to lover to stranger', I'd never put words to that feeling." I told her how I still feel really guilty about what happened. 

"You did the best you could, Sofi" 


I dreamed something today but I can't remember. I recall buying food. There was a school and people speaking english. I was with Catherine, I accompanied her and waited for her in the car. Later, when she returned we were in a school. But why wasn't she Catherine anymore? I was following somebody else. Monica appeared and I looked for her. Why did she keeps appearing? Why can't I let her go? 

Just a couple of assignments and a test and I'm done. I payed for everything already. I just have to ask my father for the money to buy the last missing ticket to disneyland. 

Yesterday I drank with Catherine. Two thirds of a liter and a third of one of beer. It hit me worse than other times. I was dizzy, I was easygoing, sensitive.  I could had send the message to Paola. Why do I want to tell her first? Why do I want to tell them now? I won't see them much in the near future. Why do I want to share it? Is it a compensation for not daring to open up to my dad? 

I have him in this room. We are almost all of us here in my uncle's tv room. It's a costume in my family to have the tv on and no one watching him. I am the TV room in my family. 

He is the furthest one away from me. My mother, next to me, is the one closest to me right now in every way. She knows, but to what extent? 

"Has she said something else since then?" 

No, nothing. Why hadn't I thought about it. Did she get it? Did her "son"s were a consequence of what I said? Has she said anything to my dad? He didn't react in any way when Luis told him mi shoes were woman's. 

Do those actions count in any way as little ways of me trying to tell him? I know they don't work, why do I keep doing the same?

"His mother died, he lives with his older brother who has a problem with his sexuality. He let his hair grew and now is called Betty in his house." "Oh..." "Yeah, and some other things that 'perverse'". 

I was sitting by her side. I was lying in that couch with everyone else in the room. They were chatting about something so little important that I wasn't even hearing. Why did I put attention to what came next? Would things had been different if I hadn't? 
I was just next to her. She was giving me her back when she stabbed me in mine. 

I cried my eyes out the day before. I was sensitive with my soul peeled and vulnerable. It should had killed me. I was supposed to be devastated. I didn't feel anything. I was numb. Her words came all the way through to my ears. Anger, sadness made an appearance in my mind but I didn't feel any of them. 

I thought a thousand things but felt nothing. 

A whole day has passed and I still don't know what I'm feeling. 

I had just finished yesterday's words. I had my laptop closed over my lap when I broke. 


It's the first time I brought my laptop with me and actually used it. I finished the words in their house. I finished the first part of the theory on the way there and the second on our way back. I finished all of the redaction of that chapter this morning. Those are my lasts works. I gave my essay to my mother. She read it. She complimented it. Why would I do something like that? Why do I keep showing myself? 

How can I think about showing me to my dad when I have those comments from the only person in my family who knows? What can I do? 

Rene asked me if going to Spain was some kind of escape. No, I denied it without any assumption. He just nodded his head as if I had read his thoughts. He told me now how I should look for options, things I can do, goals I can reach. The United States is an option, he gave me Canada as another one. Mexico city is the nearest and most feasible of all. That is not an escape, I want to come back, I want them to know me. Why does the word exile keeps coming to my head then? 

We went to a chinese restaurant with my grandmother. I remember Catherine's words about taking the cellphone out on the table. Luis was in his and covered her ears with his earphones. My ipod was still in my pocket with my earbuds hanging from my jeans. I wasn't hiding behind nothing and yet I wasn't there. I was a shadow. A mindless, void body. 

My grandma kept making comments and I had to resurface to hear them and answer her. 

The house of my uncles will be no more. They're selling it. They're making it better with the intention of raising its price and sell it. What memories do I have there? Christmases. Half of them had been there. The other in my grandmother's. I remember much of them. The sensation of wanting the time to run faster. The wish for the midnight to fall now and open the presents. It was always about the presents. Seeing what's the next new thing. What new material want could fulfill my need of what I didn't had? What could bring me happiness? 

My mother made the observation. I didn't enjoy any of those. 

I have those memories and I recall them fondly. The christmas tree, the lights, the rush. In Spain I missed that TV and that couch. Now it's that same couch which brings me back-pain. Will I miss that house? The pool? The billiards table? Are those material things different from all the other ones? When, at what age did I finally came to the conclusion that I couldn't find there what I needed? 

What do I need? What do I want? 

I want to feel freedom, I want to be happy. I want to open up and be seen. I want to be able to change my body. I want my body. I want my face. I want everyone to see me how I am. 

What do I need to get that? A doctor? Laser hair removal? Hormones? A new birth certificate? A scholarship for the master? A job? A future? 

I want a future and at the same time I want the present to freeze and let me breathe.

I cheated again. I had to. I really did. 

"I was upset, because you told me you'd stop going to therapy. You'd get a job and it's the first step for you to leave. I'll be alone." 

Now I am finished. This was my last exam. My last trip to the school as a student. Tomorrow I'll give the last paper and I'll be done. It won't be in the school. It'll be the last time I'll go to the hospital. The last time I'll enter and be greeted by the guard. Why did it crossed my mind to paint my face, color my eyes and lips, see if that's enough for him to notice. 

Why do I want to do that? Why would I? 

Yesterday was when I finished and sent the last paper of Thanatology? I had to write a last thought. A message of a final learning of the class. I used it to talk about death and the beauty of life. I finished and I had still much to say. Zayra took a picture with me. She said good bye, she told us how it was a pleasure to work with us. It was for me. It really was. I think she ended up being my favorite teacher, and I wanted to tell her. So I made a second last message. There in my paper I wrote a thank you note. I wrote her how she taught me about history in my first semester. She taught the class that would end up being my focus, she guided me and trained me in the art of psychotherapy. She helped me when my patient abandoned me. And now, this semester she taught me a class about death and closure. It was so fitting and it couldn't be left unsaid. 

I thanked her for seeing me, for noting me. I thanked her for helped me with my tears, for the pat on the shoulder when I broke again in the last workshop. I was thankful and emotional. I sent her the last homework and a hug, too. "Your work is received, and so is your hug. I send one back". 

All of yesterday was doing homework. Saturday was when I went to Mexicali and started with the chapter I had left undone for most of the semester. Sunday I came back and wrote and elaborated what I felt with my mother's words. I saw the picture of Chevo and Jessica with Paolas. I felt betrayed. Lonely. I am ending up alone again. It's a thought that's been sneaking up to me. 

I did the statistical analysis, I wrote the results and discussion. I made almost all of the work. It was a lot, but I didn't mind. Today I had the test of reasearch. And it wasn't as easy as it should be. It wasn't hard either. It was badly made. It was poor. I knew the correct answer but didn't knew what they wanted me to give. I was frustrated and annoyed. It was supposed to be our last test, our last departamental. It wasn't, it ended up being something else. The experience was different. 

I shaved and showered. I put on the pants she gave me and the hoodies we bought with our generation. Like the pictures in that exam, we used them and received compliments. They didn't know the meaning of them, they saw the image and the letters but it was void of significance to them. It was like the name in the back of mine that I had forgotten. 

I cried, I cried hard letting a lot of emotion out. I am frustrated and scared. I don't know what or how I'll end up doing. Will I work, will I apply for a scholarship? How can I fight for what I am if I have to convince I am real? 

What if I can't? what if I can't go to the master? what if I can't go to the capital? what if I can't be me? 

I am scared of applying for a job. I am scared of being denied. I am scared of being conditioned to cut my hair and being Ivan in order to do a job I'll despise and gain a misery. I am scared of living the rest of my life that way. I am scared of ending my life...
Where did that come from? 

Was it really a joke when I sang to her? Why did my eyes watered as I finished? 

"I don't want to die..." 

I don't. I don't. I am scared. I need help again. I have it. 

I did take my life pills. I didn't forget. I can take two again. I can tell my father to give me more money to buy them

I cant tell him the reason I take them, instead.

Yesterday I didn't cheat. I wrote, I wrote, didn't I? Did I talk about how we went outside the principal building and I cried and hugged her and cried like how I was never used to. I went to sleep, no, I lied in bed waiting for her to finish our last paper. Finishing the plan of activities, the material, the instructions. She designed them and made them. I helped with ideas and made the first texts, but she did everything else. I, instead, was lying in bed searching about Mexico's city's apartments. The colonies, the rent process. How could I look? How could I pay? I found about one of the procedures, the "aval", getting a person who trusts me their house scriptures as a backup payment. Where would I get something like that? Whom could I ask? I have no family there nor friends. How could I do something like that? 

How could I pay it? I felt that familiar dreary sense. Misery, my old companion. How did I miss you. I almost forgot the warmth of your surrounding. It burned me and asphyxiated me. I cried again. Hopelessness, failure, loss. I felt it all over again. I'll fail, I'll never make it. 

It's better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. 

Bullshit. 

Nessun maggior dolore. Che ricordarsi del tempo felice. Nella miseria.

The pain is way worse after knowing the pleasant bliss of happiness. 

Luis asked me again what are the symptoms of depression. I answered this time. "Why do you ask?" "Just 'cuz" ..."which of those did you have?" 

Could I open up to him? Why am I so scared? What is it that I specifically fear? 

Why didn't I mention it to my mom? Why haven't I looked for a time to talk with my dad? 

None of them saw me with the leggings. Again it was just my mother. She was working and caressed me with her notice. I waltzed into my room and closed the door. Just as I put them on I took them off, one by one, converting myself to my usual costume. I haven't put my face off. Nobody notices. There is no difference. I went to the hospital, this last time. I wanted to be different, I wanted the guard to hesitate, to say something, see something. He wasn't there, there was another one. I stood with Catherine waiting for the teacher. 

Both of us drank a cup of water. Children came to ask me where were the papercups. I answered and smiled. They saw me. No, they looked at me. What did they see? 

The parents sometimes sent their eyes my way. Was it doubt in their sights or was it repulsion? 

The teacher stepped  out of her consultation room and received our paper. We went to the burger joint we used to frequent. I drank. Half a liter of beer. They didn't have iced tea nor dark beer. I ordered the usual burger and she the chicken sandwich. When we enter, the waiter received us with the usual welcome [neutral, masculine]. Was it pain or disillusionment? Did the second one hurt more or less? 

Maybe I'll miss those masculine terms when the time comes that I'll receive hate instead. 

She drove us to the beach after that. Argana coffee shop. Hookah and two chai frappes. I was upset because she told me she'd go to the bathroom but didn't leave. Why did I want her to go? I'd miss her. I'd be alone. What was the difference that she'd leave then or a couple of minutes after? 

We took pictures. We took the last day of classes and then yesterday the last exam and now, today, the day we gave our last homework. 

It'll not be until march that we'll be officially graduates. Do I want it? It never excited me to be a psychologist or a licenciate. Why would I care now? 

The only thing that I want to be is me. I thought about writing Ivan. 

What if I can't change my name in the birth certificate? what if I just can change the gender. What if I'll be a feminine version of the person I used to be. A depressed and miserable woman. Ivana. Josephine Ivonne. I'd never liked Jose. 

I keep thinking about asking Cabrales about his work in the trans clinic. Did it open? What happened to it? 

Could he attend someone like that? 

Could he attend me? 

I haven't asked Rene. 

Of what am I scared about asking him? Is it his denial? No. Am I scared that I won't keep going with him if he can't help me? What if nobody can?

"I realized how then I wanted to evaluate, apply and grade psychometric tests. I wanted to diagnose and see what was the problem. Fixing it would be someone else's job. I wanted to know what was wrong with me. Now that I know I want to help people because I need help myself." 

"You could make the clinic yourself" "I could be the expert". 

I sang to Catherine. She sang to me today. Miguel was already in the house. He was asleep but I hesitated to play the audio in my phone. I told her he was around and she answered that then it should wait. I was lying in my bed when I played it. "You are asleep and I can feel you breathing" The Hombres G song. "Whenever I sang it, I think about you." 

I decided to sang to her, too. I looked for the lyrics of that spanish song and whispered it to my phone. I memorized the first verses. 

I couldn't wake up this morning. I was so tired. I still am. I showered and got ready. I had more time than I thought. I didn't shave nor put makeup. I had to put gas to the car and then drove to the usual plaza to park the car. I paid the 5 pesos instead of the 24 I did the first sessions. Now I walk a kilometer maybe with the way there and back. I use the time to focus, to think and let me feel. I like my sessions now. I like crying with him. I like talking and taking my shell off, my disguise, saying my name a loud, not worrying about people listening or being judged. I like feeling vulnerable and knowing nothing will happen. 

I like being seen and listened to. 

I don't think about wearing the clothes anymore. I remember months back where going with the bra was something to be nervous about. "What if somebody notices?" "What if he felt it?" "What if she hugs me?". Now it's weird not having it on. It's mine, they're mine. They don't turn me on. They don't make me feel sexy nor girly. Why do I wear them? I don't need them. I don't. 

This week we will go to the United States and buy clothes for the wedding. I knew that already. My father asked me if I had a suit already. I do. I have the clothes. I've worn them twice already. They're almost new. I don't want to buy another one. I don't need new clothes. No, I do. I need new clothes but not bought from them. I want new clothes but not like the ones I already own. I want them but I don't want to be mocked when I choose them. I don't want to be seen weirdly when I pay for them, being judged when I try them on. 

I liked when the old man said he thought I was a woman. I liked that it happened and that I knew. It won't happen if I wear a suit. I'll be seen as a man. Like the man I should be. 

"I'm all finished", I said when I started the session. I'm not. I still have to do the paperwork. I have to get the title. Psychologist. It feels wrong. They don't give a title of sickness. It should be the other way around "Jose IvÃ¡n, psych grad." "Sofia F, lic. in Psych" "Jose Ivan, melancholic depressive, r.i.p" 

Now I'm just being dramatic. 

Tomorrow I'll take Miguel to school and then drive to Catherine's house. We'll play monopoly or watch something. I want to lie with her on the couch and have her arms around. Tomorrow will rain. I didn't remember but she has our hookah. She has the coffee liquor. I can ask her if there's still some. 

He went to France, he knew people like me. He talked about them. That's something he didn't use to do. Three of them. One of them a model. They changed. They finished psychology and changed. At first I thought how I didn't want to do that. I just did. In a couple of months I'll have the papers. 

I can sent Cabrales a message. Ask him. 

I could had asked Rene if he could help me. Why haven't I? 

"I want hormones. Could you help me? You are a doctor, could you assesorate me? Do I need a endocrinologist, an gynecologist? Should I tell my prime care doctor? Do you know somebody who could help me?, I don't want to wait until I'm all alone to start"

40 days since Halloween. If by then I had 56 days, now would be 96 since Chevo and Jessica's graduation. Almost a 100 days of being medicated. I didn't took a pill today. Do I feel different? Why am I curious about that sadness? Is it the same curious I feel about telling my parents? Why am I tempted to misery? 

I keep flirting with my past. I don't want it. I don't. 

Yesterday I finished the update of my resume. It looks presentable, complete. I saw the one of Juan Carlos Perez. He reviewed Ahmed's thesis for his doctorate. I was interested in it. I saw his curriculum, he studied the first couple of semesters in the technological school. He wanted to be an architect. When he exited school he had a lower grade than me and he felt proud to publish it on his resume. He put his Exhcoba results, too. Will I? Will it help me? 

Yesterday I felt ok. I was satisfied with it. It seemed complete. It was attractive. I could do something with it. People could want me. 

People should want me. That doesn't mean they will. 

Today was the first day, no. I had yesterday. I did nothing today. I woke up after the hour I should. I was going to go to Catherine's house. I didn't know what to wear. I wanted to wear the leggings, something feminine. Why? Why if it's not enough? 

"I feel pretty with you" "You are" "That's not true. I still look like a man" "Not always" 

I saw the video of the trans woman Catherine has seen. She's subscribed to her channel. She did her research. She knows about transition. She has looked for information. She wants to know. Monica never did. 

Why do I keep comparing them? Why do I still sometimes feel this urge to make me sure I love her? She's better than her. I am better with her than I've always been. Why do I keep thinking about it? What else do I need to do? I stopped talking to Monica, I talked to her again, I deleted my facebook, I stop seeing her anywhere, I looked her up, I left her be. Why doesn't she go? Why is she still in my mind? I hate her because she left me and yet I hate her more because her phantom is still here. 

Victoria Volkova. She moved to the capital to start her transition. I saw her video with one of the other vloggers I had seen before. He was a little uncomfortable. The cameraman, too. It was almost unnoticeable. Almost. 

The other video I saw was of just her. She talked about the kinds of men she has been approached by. 

The third and final was more intimate. It was just her, it had no jokes. It was cathartic. It was an explosion of emotions. She made that video more for herself than for any viewer she might had. 

She hated herself. She was happier when she started transitioning. Everything was better. She started doubting. Not about herself. Not about her decision. She started not being satisfied. Her hands, her shoulders, her voice. She was not woman enough. Her eyes started watering when she touched the subject. 

"I was supposed to be happier, and then I hated myself again", the tears rolled down her cheeks. 

What was the moment when I cried? 

I should had talked about her with Rene. I should had mentioned a lot of things I did not. 

Luis surprised me when he entered my room. He felt sick. He had said it yesterday how he was nauseous. My plans were ruined. I couldn't leave the house now that he was there. It didn't matter. I could see Catherine other day. I could sleep some more. I did. Miguel made him some breakfast and got ready. 

I drove him to Costco to pick the pictures. There was a lot of traffic and my car was stubborn. I was irritated. There was something in my mind but I can't remember what. The Costco was full of people. The cars were giving rounds. There were no empty spots. He stepped down and I tried being near the exit. I stopped behind some cars. There were nobody near them. If some of them would exit I could move. 

The guard saw me several times but did not say nor do anything. Later he would. I moved all the way back and waited. Miguel texted me to tell me there would be a delay. He was the one who'd be late, not me. I shouldn't care. 

Nevermind, he had them. I picked him up and went to his school. The rain was there but not. It did and then didn't. It was a peculiar illusion, being cold and hot at the same time. Seeing the sky gray and the next moment having the scorching sun on my face. Like a badly remembered memory. 

I was just back in the house when he texted me if I could pick him up. Sure, why not. Why can't I say no? Why would I? I had nothing better to do. I am scared of the emptiness of my time and yet I wanted to be alone in my bed. 

Another hour since I left the house and got back.

What did I eat today? I, I can't remember. Miguel did breackfast. I took the last croissant. A glass of lemon juice. Two, three. There is one right in front me. What else? Yesterday was when I took two pieces of chocolate. The hot dog was yesterday, too... I made sausages, chorizo, tomatoes; two burritos. Four, two for Luis and two for me. I made him food. 

I am his big brother. No. I am not anymore. We are siblings, he is my brother. I am the phantom of his brother. I will be a secret, a spot in his family. I don't know. I don't.

I dreamed something different. Was there a shower here, too? I can't remember it. I know I went with Jessica, my Jessica, the one from my childhood. I haven't thunk how she would react to this. Would she be one of the people who wouldn't recognize me? She knows someone like me. AndrÃ©s. What is it with him? How has he dealt with this? Maybe he doesn't even have this. I am almost 23 years old. He recently or shortly will be 23 himself. I can't imagine waiting more. I can't put myself in his place. With his short hair and boyish outlook. Was he in my dream, too? He knew even before I did. He fits the narrative I hate so much perfectly. Playing with girls' toys, having mostly feminine friends, something in his manners and behavior. I keep using male pronouns. Would he mind? I have not more than 3 years that I know and they burn me. The looks sicken me. The sirs and young mans. They're like slaps to my face. I can't describe the joy I feel when someone has a mistake. Has he experienced it? I want to show him, tell him. 

In my dream we needed to do something for other thing. Was it a party? was the thing a dance? We were going to a dojo. The one where I went as a child. I had maybe half the age Luis has right now. Edgar wasn't my uncle but my big brother. I did have a big brother. I wasn't an only child; I grew with him. Having two male role models wasn't enough. I can't blame my uprising. 

I didn't want to go there. I wanted something else. Why didn't I just said no? What kept me there? Night came and went. The person in charge of the place told us he could give us lessons in the weekend when the adults took them. Norma, her mother, explained that wasn't what we were looking for. He told us his hands were tied. There was nothing he could do. We left and I was relieved. 

When I watched the time I remember this words. The streak wasn't 41. No, it was bigger. I remembered that by the 26 I'd beat the last one. It was closer than that. Was it 50? Does that mean it was just a week before christmas? Maybe that was the other thing. 

I woke up early. Then another time when my father came to my room to ask me if I'd go. I did. 

We went to the other side of the border. Since yesterday I wanted a burger but thought about denying the potatoes. Maybe a side salad. I thought about it. I liked the idea. Do I feel fat again? Am I uncomfortable with my body? 

Yesterday I forgot my pill and stood with the abstinence side effects. I had trembling in my leg and felt the beginnings of the darkness. 

Dexter was when he called his dark side "his dark passenger" He was a serial killer, I am just a depressed person. 

I remember how pathetic I was in jr high school thinking I was like him. I felt empty inside. I felt a void, nothing. A black hole that sucked me from the inside. I saw him and his lack of emotion and empathy and felt identified. Thank god I didn't do anything idiotic like hitting our dog or having suicidal behaviour... No, I did have that. 

I should had known there was something wrong in me. Maybe a part of me always did. 

I won't beat the fastest time I've done of 17 minutes. Now are 17 minutes after the eleven. In that time I wrote in spanish. I hadn't thunk about that. It's been more than a hundred times that I've written in my second language. Am I better in this. It flows faster. 

I haven't even talked about today. We went there and bought food and then the clothes. Everybody would buy something. Everyone of us needed something. My mother needed a dress, my father a shirt. Luis, too. Neither I nor Miguel did. He'd buy something and I'd too, but both of us for different reasons. I didn't want to, but had to. He didn't have, but wanted. 

It hurt. Sometimes, walking in the store I'd wander and look at the clothes. I'd like something be tempted by it. 

In any of the stores did I feel it. No. 

I bought a shirt, and actually tried two of them. But it was weird looking at myself in the mirror. 

In the other store I wasn't interested in anything on that floor. When my mother got lost, I offered myself to look for her. Luis wanted to come with me so I didn't stay there looking at the clothes. No, that wasn't the reason. In Ross I was with my mom when she picked her dress. There were complete rows of just women's clothes. In the other stores, too. There were in all the stores I was in. Every one of them. Why didn't I look? What kept me from it? Will someone think or suspect something? No, I wore the rainbow bracelet again. Nobody has made a comment. 

I put the red strap in my watch, it's more feminine than I thought. We went to the alitas. I ate with my family. I drank. I feel the effect of the alcohol. I want to talk, tell them. What keeps me? What is it? Of what am I so afraid? 

I saw a job offering. A university asking for a psychology major. I didn't send my cv. A thousands reasons came to mind. The age, the experience, the time... What was the real one? Am I afraid of being denied? Am I scared that they'll actually call me? Do I fear that they'll see me and tell me to cut my hair? 

What is it? What the fuck is it?

From all of my schools I keep dreaming with grade school most of them all. What is it that makes that building peculiar? I was there 5 years. Yeah, it's almost more than any of the rest. Just university was 4 and a half. The next half doing all the paperwork will be the semester left. 

The sun was dangerous. The heat was intense. It wasn't the beginning of the dream There were more of backstory. I remember being in a cafeteria. We were going to meet. Chevo, Jessica, Paola? Catherine obviously. Why weren't they there? I was alone. I was waiting. When I woke there was just Jessica. "And the rest?" She couldn't give me an answer. She was with somebody else. I kept waiting and can't recall what happened. The next thing I know I was walking in the school. I didn't belong there. There were familiar faces but not really. The sun was hot but not alarmingly so. Nobody realized it. I tried asking to be let in, but they refused. It wasn't that I didn't belong in the building. I didn't belong in that time. It was the future. I try asking the teacher to be let in. She hesitated. I begged. "Look, let me show you something." I grabbed a spoon and left it outside. The shadow was growing narrower each passing moment. 

"Wait, please" In a moment after you see what I want to show you, you can let me out if you want, but just wait a little. 

A cloud shadowed the hall and I opened the door and grab a disintegrating metal handle. "Now you see?" 

I ran the rest of the hall and met some other familiar faces, they were wearing glasses, and even in the alarming state I was I thought they looked pathetic. I swallowed my laughter and got in. There was a little girl crying. They had cut her hair. I hugged her. It was as if I knew her. I did. There I did, now I don't. That same girl was older and sitting in a chair in the back of the room. I went to her and she recognized me... No, I didn't went to her. I went to myself. I was sitting with them. Except I wasn't. I was dead. That me was dead. Was it just the half of my body? Was it a corpse? A kind of memory? What was it? I know I asked for an explanation but they told me other thing. It was the future. We died together. We stood a group. Catherine and I were a couple. There were problems with money. Apparently she payed for us. We drowned in a frozen lake or something. How did I get there? How was it knowing there was a time when I wouldn't exist anymore? 

I dreamed more things but don't remember any. I stayed in bed. I got up, had breakfast and came back. I should had sent the mail. I should be looking for a job. I am scared. I didn't sent the curriculum, I didn't talk with my mom nor my dad, I didn't asked Cabrales nor Rene. I haven't done anything. There is less than a month until I am 23. I haven't worked a single day in my life. I did. I got a paycheck. 

I feel again I'm wasting time. It keeps running and running. I should take two pills. One isn't enough. 

I should breath. I told myself I wouldn't look for a job until january. Then I would know what to do. Then I'd have all the time in the world. 

What will happen with Rene or Cabrales? I can ask the doctor any time I want, I don't know if I'll get an answer or what exactly will I ask. 

And Rene? I am scared he can't do anything for me. 

I feel lonelier than ever. I need a distraction, a job. I could work for free and gain experience. I could volunteer, but where? 

Do what? 

I could write. Being invisible who would want to read me? Who would pay me to hear what I have to say? 

There are less than 2 weeks for Christmas. 3 weeks till new year. 2015 is going to end. 

What year will I be born? I got used to the idea of being born in 1993, and never wanted to think much about the one where I'd die.

Will my second birth year will be my first death?

"You have something better: a girlfriend." 

Did I dream something today? I remember opening my eyes and being earlier than I thought at first. I stayed awoke. I grabbed my phone and played a little. Why did I want to be awake early in the morning? I couldn't sleep. The clock marked 3 in the morning while I kept tossing and turning. 

I didn't forget to take my pill today. I showered and shaved. Is there a difference in me? I put the inner pants that my mother had gave me before I left for Spain. I'm wearing them with a bigger pajama pants over. When I was in the couch playing with Luis I took the pants off. When he saw my legs under the blanket he remarked how I was wearing hoses. "Are you wearing tights?". No, I answered him with the truth when I could had used the opportunity. How could I had told him? I had another opportunity too when I used the hermione costume. 

I put the pants on again after he left to go to bed. I played videogames almost all day. When I wasn't lying in the couch I was sitting in the table. I just ate and played. At least I did take a shower today. 

Tomorrow won't be the day when my cousin comes. No. It'll be on Wednesday. Why am I worried? He won't know anything about me. My father has lived all my life with me and has no idea. That I don't know. He might have an idea. He hasn't said anything. Maybe that's a sign I hadn't thunk about. There have been things that people who wouldn't have an idea about would had said something. 

I had a headache almost all day. 

I saw another job offering and ignored. No, I didn't ignore it. I just let it pass. What is it now? It didn't have a bad time schedule. It didn't show any requirements I didn't have. 

Yesterday in bed I saw all of my grades. Four complete hundreds and a ninety-one. Four hundred and ninety one. That's the grade score of this last semester. I took my list of classes and their respective grades and calculated my own GPA. I don't remember what exactly was I expecting. I had a 94. I was the second place. Hilda was, is the first one. I don't know how she ended. Maybe she'll keep her place. She'll be first of the class. She'll get a job and be happy. 

I'll graduate with a 98. 98 of 100. I spent all day knowing it and still I can't totally believe it. I expect somebody to come and correct me. A change, something. Something lower. Why can't I accept it? What does it mean? Is it another advantage that won't mean anything at all? Is another thing that'll be ignored when I apply? 

I have clinical experience, research experience. I studied a semester in Spain, I will graduate with a notable GPA. Why do I still feel nobody will call me? 

Nobody will accept me? Because I'll look like a boy. I will be a boy and look differently. 

"Vania has a driver's licence now, I don't know how to feel", she confessed me right before she entered with Liliana. I cut her mid-thought. "If you don't have it it's just because you don't want it".

Why exactly do I get irritated with those things? 

I realized later at night while we were talking. I see myself in her. I have doubts and fears. I want to advance but don't dare to. I am scared and paralized. She is scared and paralized and I want her to advance, do something, so it will mean I can, too. 

I didn't tell my mom until after she did. Why did I wait until that? Will I wait for her father, too, so I can tell mine? 

I didn't dream it, I thought about it. I considered it. 

I haven't checked the car. We didn't drive it. I could ask him. "Dad, can we check the jetta?" He'll say yes and get his coat. I'll go for the keys and courage. I'll sit in the driver's seat and take off. We'll drive in the neighborhood, it will be dark already. He'll ask me to take a turn and go back home. Maybe it will be fine, maybe it won't. It won't matter, I'll stop in the street. "I need to tell you something, Dad" 

I'll start. I'll say it. Soon. 

I hope.

"I can't take this anymore. I don't want this anymore. I'm sick of all this, it's enough. I'm fucking tired of being in his classes, dressing like you, being seen by everyone like if I were you." Her reflection was lying in front of her, his face was covered in her screams. Then she punched him again and again. The woman hugged him and returned her the hits. Then she grabbed her in her other arm and both of them cried and wallowed in unison. 

I woke earlier now. At first, at least. I got myself out of the nightmares. Lucifer, my mom, again the bathroom and a morning routine, being late, being in a class and another glimpse of the symptoms, a symbolic scene and a chasing nightmare. 

I answered the messages of Anahi "It feels weird waking up this early" "You gotta be kidding me, it's 9 o'clock in the morning, Sofia". 

She uses my name and I feel warm inside. It feels corny and a little pathetic and I hate myself for it, but I like it. Why does it bother me? Why do I feel it fake? Why am I so accustomed to misery that anything else feels so undignified? 

Tomorrow my cousin will come. He will bring his girlfriend with him. They'll both stay in my bedroom. I have to wake up early so my dad can come with my to the mechanic and give me a ride home. Late Catherine will come for me and take us to the beach. We can do something there. By the night or evening that I return they'll be here. I didn't know what to wear. I wanted to wear something feminine. Not the dress or the skirt but nearly. I wanted to feel that worry of being noticed. I wanted to be confusing. Unrecognizable. 

I don't care anymore. No, I do. I care less than ever. 

I woke up with two words stuck in my throat: "I'm trans". 

I wanted to spit them out, scream them, rub them on everyone's face. I wanted to post them on facebook and twitter, tell my parents and brothers and God. I wanted everyone to know, to judge me, to take this burden away of me and being free. 

I want back to sleep and I guess that was what I was running away from. There were no one following me, not lucifer or a ghost or a gang. Not a single person was after me. I was running from my self. 

"People don't know if you are a man or a woman". That was one of his insults today. The little idiot thought I'd be offended by that? That's what I want, dumbass. 

He hugged me. Has he ever done it before? He made himself a maruchan soup. "Is it of shrimp and chilli?" "No", he answered. He knows I like that flavor, and inferred I would ask him for a taste. Whatever, sure. I kept playing. 

When I got up and look for something to eat I saw the wrapping of the paper cup. He lied to me. I called him and told him. "No, sorry" he exclaimed. "Sorry, sorry". "It's just soup" I was meaning to say, I turned my head silently. He grabbed me with one arm and got close to me. 

It was just soup. He loves me, he missed me and admires me. I'm his big brother and role model. What will he think of me when he knows? What will people say about him when they know? Would he hug me when I tell him? What will I tell him? "You were right, I'm an hermaphrodite"? "I like when people don't know my sex, moron, they always get it wrong"? "I did dress up as Hermione in Halloween. I dress up as Ivan every single other day"? 

"I am not your brother. I am not a man." 

"Ivan, can you teach me about it? Like when you explained the situation about the women with a Y chromosome and when they have XXX and more?" 

Why does it hurt me so much? Why am I so angry and with whom? 

Everything would be easier if they hated me. If they didn't care. If they'd be angry and upset I could do it for myself and fight for what I want. Why does it hurt me their love and acceptance? Why was it easier the comment that my mom made? I expected that. That was known territory. 

I was alone with my dad on the car but I kept my mouth shut. I didn't say anything. 

There's a difference with the waiting period of sending my resume and doing any of these things. With one I put myself a deadline, because I don't actually want to do it. With the other I want to do it now, but I don't dare to. 

I am terrified of both.

"There is something that I want to tell you: I am trans. I don't need to or have to, I just want to say it. Sharing it is not something that I've liked. None of the times I've liked it. I can think of a thousands reasons, but primarily it's that I feel like if it were a confession. Yes, it was a secret. But it's not a felony or a sin. Definitively it's not a sickness or a perversion. Just recently I realized it's not even a problem. This is why I wanted to tell you in the most casual way. 
I am transgender. Not a lot of people know what it is. Even less really understand it. Maybe this is why it's not something that's really accepted. If you want to know or you already do but still want to comprehend me more, you can start by reading here [link]. 
If you have a comment or a more personal doubt, you're welcome to tell me. If you feel like making a joke to release the tension or tell me why you don't agree, I don't think this is the best time for that. 
I can change the way I look or talk or dress, but I can't never change who I really am, just hide it. And I got sick of masks. 
I can't change either how you see me. I can only ask you how to refer and treat me and with time, hope you see me as I feel. 
To some, it has been hard or way too much. If that's your case, too, even though it'll hurt, I'll understand. And, just like them, you're welcome to look for me whenever you are ready. 
If you want to try and keep contact, you can add me on this new profile. 
Whether you read everything or just the first sentence, thank you for seeing me. 
Whether we've shared just a couple of words over the internet or a whole life-time of memories, thank you for being there. 
I know there lies a long a hard path ahead of me, but you can't even imagine the relief that is to realize that I don't have to travel it alone. 

Before Ivan until finally me 

SofÃ­a F" 

I was woken by my father at 6 in the morning. I don't remember a better night sleep than today's. I got up anyway and put on pants. I waited with Luis and him, until the time came to leave. We drove separately to the shop. There was not a lost opportunity there. We were kind of alone in the dinning room after Luis and my mother left, but I didn't take it. After leaving the jetta, I had it. We waited, also, before the mechanic arrived. He talked instead of the house of my uncle. His plans. Whether they're the plans of my uncle to sell his house and buy another one, or the ones of Edgar to buy a terrain and build a home, he always sees the way the won't be able to. He sees how they'll fail and why. He knows and it's convinced by it. He doesn't tell them. No, he says it later, to somebody else. Will he do that to me, too. Am I scared of that? 

"He'll never be a woman. He'll fail. He'll never be able to get a job. It doesn't matter what he takes, his body will reject it. It won't be changing enough. There will be problems when he goes to the capital to look for the change of papers. There will be problems. He, he, he." 

I can think of a lot of reasons why I don't want to tell them. It doesn't ever matter how many or big they are, why do I keep coming back to thinking and consider it? 

I can't tell him so I want to tell the world instead. I can't take this anymore. My mind is screaming it at me. I'm hurting myself but do nothing to change the condition I'm in. 

Catherine came to pick me up and I received her with make up and the woman's sweater. I found myself pretty. Even after the razor burned me like never before, I liked myself. I wore a little hat she gave me and felt right, comfortable. I didn't mind the sights. I was myself. That's the only think that mattered. 

I can control it. I realized it when the waitress saw the three of us and welcomed us in a feminine way. 

There is just one thing. It's not my appearance or even my beard. No, it's something else. My voice. 

All my problems lie in my throat. What I can't say and how I can't speak.

"Ivan, is that... are you wearing a bra? [...] I touched you there and it felt like a brassiere" 

I always feared something like that. "It's not the hell I expected", I said to Rene. The world didn't end. He noticed. He noticed yesterday, too, when I arrived with my lips colored. He notices me. That has, I guess, its goods and draws. 

It was today. I awoke today and he asked once again. It was this morning. That should had been the quote of the day. "What are the symptoms of depression?" I answered back with a statement. "I've told you already, why do you want to know?" "Just 'cuz", I enlisted them again briefly. "Which of those have you seen in me?" 

It was, unexpected. I... I was speechless. 

What could I say? I was so full of guilt. Is it my fault? It comes in the family. I'm the biggest, his big sibling. His role model. Did he learned it from me? 

It was the opening of my session. I was woken up by my father turning on the lights at 6 in the morning. I stayed awake. I had to be ready expecting the call of my cousin. He wasn't the bigot I was constructing in my mind. The flags will stay in my room. They are a good memory. 

I spoke of the joke of my mother: "Who will try your dress?" "Well, you..." 
He didn't know of those. Hadn't I talked to about the incident where I didn't want to go in the bathroom. "It won't fall of", she said. He remarked that. I didn't see it until now. The fear of castration. Oedipus complex. 

I'm scared of demolishing the idea my brother has of me. I laugh, I cry in sessions, now. 

Why do I feel like crying now? 

I was expecting to not coming back until my birthday next week. I will go this tuesday. That's the reason I was going to go on my birthday. It wasn't a thursday because the sessions were changed. Will I go this time? What will happen, then? 

I have changed. I am not the same I was two years ago. Would I recognize myself if I saw the picture Catherine has of us in her whatsapp profile display? 

I talked about the hormones, my fear of a no. I opened the pandora box. There is no way of closing it. In the bottom lies my true happiness but I have to deal with everything else, too. I am scared of finding nothing. 

"Do some research and we will see." Was he giving me some hope? Will it be possible? Will I make it? 

What if I can't? What if I am not capable or worth it or strong enough? 

What if I never find the courage to say it or show it? What if just an act or a laugh is enough to bring me to tears and destroy me? 

What if I actually am the delicate little flower I am scared of being? 

The day after Christmas will be our trip to disneyland. The last time I went Monica was by my side. This time I'll be with Anahi and Catherine. Luis will be bigger and closer. What if I ruin it? What if my father realizes by then and doesn't speak to me? 

I won't be alone. I don't have to be alone. 

Rene had a theory he wanted to propose. He thought of two reasons of the comment that my mom made. "Maybe she said as a way to show you how people will react to knowing those kind of things, or maybe it was a way for her to feel the waters" 

I didn't buy them. No, it felt different. I sensed her repulsion. She said it as if it were something sick. I've heard that tone before. 

I was more comfortable with the idea of feeling feminine. I am a woman. 

I always repeat how I hate that phrase. Am I jealous? Why does it feel so good when Catherine says it and yet so unbelievable when I do? 

I'll see Rene next week. I can send a question to Cabrales. Maybe he knows of the clinic, maybe he knows about someone who deals with that. 

Maybe I can find the sexologist, or go personally to COCUTT and ask directly. 

I might send my resume, too, to the job offering. 

Why am I so scared? I want to advance but I'm petrified.

"When you have a girlfriend she will have a penis... no, she will be a dyke" 

I am finally sitting with my laptop on my legs. Exactly in the same spot where my mother made that comment to my aunt. Writing these same words. Will I write about the same thing? I don't remember what I was on about that time. 

Yesterday Rene gave me the green light to go on researching and looking for a doctor. I felt the pressure and went on with the search. At first I went back to the information I already had. There was a research here in Baja California where they paid and supervised the transition of about 20 people. I didn't remember the dates so I confused it with the poster of a NGO where they announced they'd do a pilot clinic where they'd give the hormones and psychological and medical attention for free to a certain number of people. Interested ones should send a mail to the people in charge with the clinic. There were the names of two sexologists and a doctor. Cabrales was once again mentioned. 

So, by then, I had three names, and a discontinued NGO. The page of the NGO had just a telephone number, but I didn't want to call them. Why? Catherine saw through me and confront me. "I know why you don't want to call, but you are closer. I feel frustrated". You have no idea how frustrated I feel. I kept on with the search. Cabrales was again mentioned as a doctor. I could communicate to him and ask him. The sexologist was Aracely Cervantes. She's a teacher in the University of Baja California. No, I don't know that. She might had just been a student from there. I found her Facebook profile. There I could send her a mail asking about her participation on the program and their results. If that were a dead end, which I'd be expecting, I could ask her about the contact of some specialist. 

I saw her pictures and found them, I don't know. I didn't like her. Why am I so shallow? They're just pictures. 

I was thinking about that when Catherine made another comment about the same thing. I exploded. I said the NGO was a stupid and discontinued one. There wasn't an address nor anything recent. It was a fucking dead end. 

I had just found the list about specialists everywhere in Mexico. There was a section about Tijuana. There were a laser clinic, plastic surgeons, two psychologists and an endo. Jackpot. Here was what I was looking for. I should had felt thrilled and proud. It was finally there. I kept searching. I looked for something else than a phone number. 

He's a doctor from the University of Baja California. He's a specialist in endocrinology and diabetics. He worked briefly in the Angeles Hospital and I think now works in the Hospital del Prado. He had good reviews of great attention. A woman posted something about the time she would have to wait. It was august and he wasn't free until january. But a couple of weeks later she posted how she was waiting for him.

I could go for him. He studied in UABC. Rene might know him. 

I wanted a doctor. Something I could reach. I didn't want to go to another intermediary. If Rene which is my own therapist and a doctor himself has no contact, what use was to go to another psychologist. I want somebody directly who could help me themselves. 

I found him. Rene gave me a go. I had his number and name. I know where I could see him. Now it's just about calling. Meeting. Asking. 

I blew up with Catherine. Ended the conversation telling her I had the name of the doctor and was going to sleep. 

She cried. I cried, too. 

I felt scared. I was afraid. I didn't know what was next. What if I am not ready? What if time goes faster and faster and it catches up with me, surrounds me, grabs me by the throat and ends me? 

I felt as if I were so fast that my head was dizzy and disoriented. 

Catherine told me she felt I was sending her of, and she felt useless. We had a problem of miscommunication. I was going faster that how she was processing. I was so fast I almost crashed. 

I escaped but it wasn't from her. 

I found what I was looking for, and it scared me. I'm still scared. I want it more than anything, and it's closer than I ever thought.

I've send the mail. 

One of many. It's done. I just clicked send and my curriculum is on its way. Today is the first day that I apply for a job as a psychologist. I feel scared, nervous. 

I talked to my father about the opening. He gave me advice for the the interview. It's the first, it's just an application, she hasn't even seen it. It doesn't mean she will respond or that I will even get and interview. Much less the job. 

I should try to communicate with the endo, too. I want that more. It scares me even more. I have to do other things first. I have to tell my dad. I have to finish these words because I won't be able to later. The wedding will be in a couple of hours. I won't have time. Time, everything is about time. The counter up here that marks the days, the little number that grows and grows. 48 is today. When I'll finish it'll mark 49. 56 was the highest before. 56 days after I took the medication. 48 now that I've again stopped talking to Monica. 

I feel this urge again to start communication. I wasn't the one who ended it. The ball is on her court. She has to make the decision, not me. 

Her wave didn't mean anything, her smile was a traitorous gesture. A mask behind a hostile thought. It's better now. 

I have too many other people that I could try to reach to. 

The job application is done. I have to talk to my father, to my brothers. I have to pick a message for the plaque of thanks that I'll give the day of my graduation.  I have to make an appointment with the endo. Make the blood work and take the medication. I have to make the other profile. 

I had a dream this morning. My back is aching and my wrist is killing me. I told Rene I never see myself in those dreams. I don't know how I look, what I'm wearing, not even how or what I am feeling. 

This dream was different. It happened several things. I remember a family. People saying they didn't like me. I remember names but can't attach them to faces. Veronica, Jennifer. A man on top of a building. Turning back time. Again a theme was reflection. It was me and a girl. Or was I the girl? 

I remember being in a bus with Catherine. Seeing a little baby with red hair. I recognized her. She was with her mom. I told Catherine to look at her as I smiled. I kept my eyes on her. She was somebody but now I don't know who. I thought her mother was a man. She had longer hair tied in a ponytail, but I saw her as a man. Then her father came to them and I realized my mistake. 

A little later, the child's grandmother approached us and went directly to me. 

"I saw you, girl, how you were looking straight to my son, you were flirting to him and he's married" 

She was mistaken but I didn't care. She saw me as a girl. Was I wearing something? Was I one? 

I woke up in ache. I already broke fast. I haven't showered nor gotten ready. 

I feel like I have a lot of things to do. Ironically I feel burdened by time, crushed by it. And yet, at the same time, I feel claustrophobic in the emptiness of it. 

I've finished school. I have nothing to do. I know not where to go. I feel lost. My future is clouded. I can't see. 

I should try my contact lenses again. Why? I like myself more with glasses. 

I will wear a suit today. How will I look? I remember the last time I wore it. It was the first day on antidepressants. It was more than a hundred days before. Three months, three months on these pills. 

Will I restart the counter when I take those other ones? 

Will I try to start them on a special date? Or the day itself when I'll start will be special on its own? 

Will I be as cheesy as to call it my second birthday? No. I hope not. 

I haven't even tried to contact the doctor. Why am I so scared to be excited? I found a specialist. He was in a list of people who care to people like me. 

I still can get disappointed. There might be a waiting list. I might be rejected. I might never get to that.

After writing the words yesterday, I decided to send the mail to the company near Catherine's house. What could I lose? I am a graduate. I have free time. I am capable. I first saved it as a draft. Then, a couple of minutes later I reopened it and hit send. I can't remember if I was already wearing a suit. Maybe I was. It was minutes before noon. We were almost leaving. I saw the post in Facebook about the other job offer of the university in the psycho pedagogic department. I went for my laptop, opened the mail and send it, too. I didn't know what university it was, but I didn't care. 

We left with the car full. Sebastian was with us. We had to pick up my grandma, buy a nail polish, leave Sebastian with my aunt and go to the party. My father had forgotten the invitations. But that happened yet. He hadn't realized. We stopped first in the Calimax near my uncle's house. It was just a couple of minutes when we were alone in the car and the phone ran. It was a woman from the university Xochicalco asking about Ivan Fernandez. She asked me if I was him and I lied. She offered and interview Monday at 1pm. I wasn't ready. I might never be. But I will be there. 

The second Curriculum sent and I have an interview. I try to not get very excited. I know I won't necessarily get it. Miguel got it in Cecut. No, I don't have to get very excited. 

After that was when my father remembered. We came back to the house and my aunt picked my cousin up. We picked my grandma and left for the hotel. 

There were lots of pictures. Of everybody, the bride and groom, the family, the siblings, the nephews and nieces. I was one of the nephews. I was the older son of my parents. The one in the suit. I see the pictures with me in an oversized suit, with my hair all tied up and invisible. I expected to be seen all man. Why would everybody notice me? Everything mine was masculine. 

Today I saw the pictures. It was weird. There is something in my face. I'm not him. It feels pathetic to type it. I hate saying I am a woman. It's like a half lie I've yet not convinced myself of. But I did look weird. My face didn't match. I was cross-dressing. Everyone is accustomed to see me this way. That is normal for them. For years it was normal to me too. 

In the church the ceremony was given by three fathers. The older one asked about why marrying by the church. "Why not just marry legally? There are some people who marry in Las Vegas, or others by 'some law'. That is not the plan of God"

I tried to be the devil's advocate when Luis told me he didn't like religion. "Why? It's an old book, those were the customs then." I felt a hot rage when I heard those words. I would not be welcome there. They don't want me. At first it was just about the homosexual relationship. Me marrying Catherine. Both of us wearing dresses. Both of us being "women". "We pray to God to make the government to protect the sanctity of marriage". The pray so I can't be with her. 

It wasn't just that. They wouldn't just despise our relationship. They would not accept me. I could not be neither a groom nor a bride. I'm nothing. I'm in the limbo. I don't exist to them. I'm a mistake and God doesn't make them. I am mistaken. 

It was the church. It's religion. That I know. There area laws. There are ways for us now to be happy. "I don't even want it, anyway." 

She imagined herself, maybe, walking through the aisle with her dad on her arm. Standing there to his partner. Being seen by everyone and their love celebrated by all their relatives and friends. 

We arrived to the salon. Luis was telling me how sick he felt. We had not eaten. The menu there was a salad with cranberry sauce and meat covered in cerulean sauce. Neither of us would eat. We both did. 

There the couple married too but now by the law. The judge made the same comments about the purpose of being married. A man and a woman being together so they can make a family. 

I would not be welcome then, either. 

I saw the pictures my uncle took with all their friends. I envied them. A part of me wanted just that. Being there, having that. I just then remembered the suit. If I'd be in their place I would not have so many friends. 

If I'd be in their place I wouldn't want to wear a suit and being called Ivan by everybody. Not just all of my friends would not attend. Part of my family would not be there, either. 

I felt sick and the exact same way I did in the graduation. That envy and self-loathing. I wanted to escape. The clothes burned me. My neck is still red. 

I stood with the men and walked around the groom to receive the band. 

Catherine just told me today about her father. They talked about the trans son of his coworker. "the daughter of the crazy cholo who is kind of weird" Catherine told him that he is now his son. "Ah, why? Just because she wants [...] but Therin, what is that? She is a girl, we met her as a girl." "She is not a girl anymore. He is now a boy" her mother corrected him. 

I felt nothing. Nothing at all. I imagined him saying it about me and it didn't bother me. I want to tell my dad. Yesterday I wanted it so much. Morning came and it brought me back but not totally. I want to. I am not scared anymore. I am tired and exhausted. I want to dress and be how I want. I should not care about other people. 

He told me to wear the suit tomorrow for the interview. I won't. I'll wear pants and a shirt. I'll wear the tie but other blazer. I'll tie my hair. 

If I'm accepted I will have proven myself I can get a job easily. If not, I can focus on being me and know I can fight for myself. I can be how I want to be, doing what I want to do, and, more than anything. be happy.

"She called me just now. I have an interview tomorrow at 11 in the morning" 

I was just outside the school. I was waiting in the parking lot passing time chatting with her on the phone. I arrived 5 minutes after I left my own house. I didn't wear the suit. I put the gray pants and the white shirt I used to wear with Catherine's uniform. The coat I put on was a casual one. The tie was the red one. She did send her resume. The lady from human resources called her and tomorrow will have her interview. 

"Do you have a partner?" "Yes" "What's her name?" "She's called Catherine, Catherine Rodriguez". 

I didn't realize it until I was at home. What would she had said if she were in my place? "Do you have a partner?" "Yes, I have a girlfriend. She's called Sofia". 

She can't say that anymore. She has to lie. No, whatever she says is a lie. I didn't lie. I do have a girlfriend, her name is Catherine. What am I? 

She could discriminate her by her sexual orientation. She would ask her in a subtle way. "Are you married? Are you in a relationship?"

I had my first job interview as a professional. It went well. I didn't hesitate, we made rapport, I answered everything and even though I didn't have enough job experience, I had several with groups and other stuff. 

Why do I still feel like a failure?  

Even if I pass now, there are a lot of filters still. She would call me tomorrow or the day after. I have until Christmas evening to receive her call. Why don't I know what I want? The girl from the other job never returned or answered my mail. I haven't called the doctor to make an appointment. I haven't sent the sexologist a mail asking her for information about the study or about someone who could help me. 

I'll be fighting with Catherine for the job. She was upset about that. We have the same experience. We have the same resume. If she gets the job but not me, what would that mean? 

Would I feel better if it were me who ends up with it? 

Tomorrow we will go for the permits for the disneyland trip. I am nervous about that, too. We have to meet with the lady who has the tickets outside the park. She will hand them to us there. What if she doesn't go? What if she leaves? What if something happens? 

What if everything goes wrong? 

What will I talk about tomorrow? 

I didn't do anything. I didn't talk with my dad. I didn't called the doctor. I didn't send the sexologist a mail. No, I did other things. I went to the wedding. I wore the suit for a full day. I sent my resume and had a job interview. 

The year is ending. 

Time is still going. 

I'll be 23 in a couple of weeks. 

I have the name of the doctor and his number. My dad is alone upstairs. 

"Dad, I am not a man". 

"Dad, I am sorry." 

"I have to tell you something" 

I don't know how. I don't want to. I do know. I do want. What is it then? What blocks me? What impedes me of going right now and tell him? What forbids me to grab the phone and call the doctor and ask for information? 

Why do I feel more like an impostor? Why am I more upset? I almost forgot to take my pill again. I remembered after I came back from the university. 

Christmas will come soon enough. I wanted to tell him before then. I wanted them to know, to remember. I wanted to wear whatever I wanted in the park. I will be with Catherine and Anahi. What if they say something? What if they misspeak? My brothers doesn't know. I could tell them. Why do I keep thinking about what else to do instead of doing what I want? 

How can I say it? What will he do or say? How will he react? Is that really what scares me? What is it then? 

Why do I flirt with the idea and yet stay in my seat just wondering. Every passing day that goes I still suffer about what I think and feel and fear. 

I told him about going to the capital. I told him about the master. He knows about that. I told him about the interview. 

I tell him about a lot of things but the thing that burns me and burdens me. 

"Dad, I am trans. Please look at me"

"Hello, Ivan, yes indeed that program ended [...] Happy holidays." 

The phone vibrated once halfway into the movie. I had took it out from my pocket, the back pocket because the pants I was wearing were women's, before the movie began to take a picture with Luis, then there were no new notifications. I saw the banner which told me that Aracely had accepted my request. I guess when I sent her a message Facebook asked her if she wanted to let me communicate with her. I quickly put it away. I was scared. My body started trembling. Emotion ran from the floor up to my legs and body. A shiver shook me as I felt the vibrations again and again. 

I took it out again and a glimpse from her text got to my sight. I couldn't concentrate on the movie. I finally watched it with Luis. We weren't alone. The whole family saw it. We went first to the consulate to get the permits we'll need for the disneyland trip. What would I wear? My father woke me up in the morning. I was going to take a shower but my mother was in the bathroom. Then Miguel got in. After him they sent Luis, too. I ended up being the last person to get ready. 

What clothes could I wear? I've been wearing all masculine clothes. I'm tired of them. I wanted something different. I didn't wear a bra. The underwear I picked is the most neutral I own. The pants I've never worn them. I chose the long red sweater and over it I put the long coat. The rain fell and wet us all. The person who would give us the permits interrogated my dad. He asked question to Miguel, too. What does he study, how far along is he? In my turn, he looked at me and the questions began. What do I study? What am I doing? I lied. I said I'm still studying. I said I'm in the last semesters still. I haven't finished as if I were stuck. 

It came natural to me. Even though I did it, my father reinforced it when we exited. "Don't tell them you've finished. Whenever they ask just say you are in the last semester". 

I am stuck but not in school. I thought I was afraid of graduation, but I'm restless. I'm anxious for it. 

All of us will graduate from school and I'll graduate from him. 

I haven't told him, nor him, nor anyone. 

"With all of my men" she posted on Facebook. Those kind of posts irritate me. I am not one of her men. I am not a man. I'm not. I'm tired of being seen as one. 

"She lost a lot of weight, it might be because of her graduation" "Will I lose weight, too, then?" "You won't wear a dress". 

If she only knew. 

Will I make it? A whole night in a suit again? 

I don't know I could deal with just a couple of hours for an interview. 

I saw how Catherine went. I liked her, I wish I could look like that. I wish everything could be a little easier. 

"Two labor days" she told me they would call me in if I passed. Half went by already. Will anyone call tomorrow? They posted again the job offering in Facebook, the one for the company. They hadn't contacted either. They might never do. 

I told myself I would start sending in January. I have two more weeks to stop worrying. 

How late was yesterday when he called? I had sent him a text message questioning the time of our meeting. I was in need of seeing him. I wanted to talk. The night when I looked for doctors and news. I'm scared. I'm desperate and frustrated. 

I hesitated with the text. I had sent him a message before. No, it was a call. "Who are you?" he asked me. "I heard a girl's voice". That's what started it. So I wrote the text. "Hello, Rene, at what time will we meet tomorrow? Will it be 11 or 12?" 

I moved the cursor to the beginning: "I'm..." I'm who? Who is sending it? I'm not Ivan. Am I Sofia? I am not Sofia in this house. I am Sofia in Catherine's company, in our dates, in our conversations, in Rene's office. In this house I'm still Ivan. I will be Ivan these vacations, these holidays. I haven't graduated. I'm not yet a psychologist nor Sofia. 

I put it anyway. 

He called me back. I missed it and took the phone just a couple minutes later. 

I returned the call. 

"Hello, what happened?" "Hello, Sofia, it's Rene Cardenas, I called because I have to cancel this week's appointment..." 

His name shook me. It was supposed to be welcome, validating. Why do I still feel like an impostor? 

Is that the reason why I haven't told nor called?

Today I'll go with Catherine. What was it that happened yesterday to make me feel sad again? I didn't know what to wear. She asked me what dress or with what shoes? Do I have black tights? The questions frustrated me. I don't have many options and yet I drowned in them. No matter what I would pick I'd look like a freak. It hasn't been more than a month and I already feel imprisoned in this persona. I can't remember the last time I had put make up on. I didn't want to put before leaving. My parents would see me. They'd notice. Everyone is home. Luis, and both of my parents are sitting in the living room. Catherine will pick me up and I'll pass trough them. 

I actually considered wearing these leggings and a t-shirt and a sweater to Disneyland. I wanted to go comfortable and enjoy myself. Would I wear make up? I'd be there all day. I wanted to tell him before Christmas. I wanted to be out and comfortable there. 

I hesitated to dress myself today, even in disguise I'm not comfortable. I have the leggings under my jeans. I'm wearing the white bra under my red t-shirt. 

Catherine was supposed to pick me up by 2 o'clock. I have already broken fast. We would not eat until the evening. We were supposed to go to the hotel, have sex, undress each other and dress us again in kisses and caresses. I'd be wearing the dress, I'd be myself once again, one of the lasts times of the year. I'd be out, I'd go out to the same place where I wore the leggings for the first time. 

Something happened. A tube broke. There is no water in her house. She woke up early and made breakfast, she did her housework. She did everything she was supposed to do. It's not a cosmic punishment it's not karma, it's just an unfortunate event. 

"My mother decided she doesn't want a tube there, so my uncle broke the wall and with it a tube, so now I don't have water and can't shower."

Again she wants to assign blame to somebody. What difference does it make? Am I mad, too? Do I blame her mother, too? 

I might tell Luis. 

Why do I keep saying it to myself as if it were an excuse. A reassurance that I'll keep going. 

Today was the last day when they were going to call me if I passed. They haven't. Why do I keep thinking it? They won't. Will I keep thinking and waiting and wondering if Catherine will get the call? Will it make a difference? 

I sat besides Luis yesterday. I tried to take a picture but I didn't want to put the flash. The last time I was in a picture with flash in the movie theater I was sitting in the last row wearing make up and a skirt. Monica was a couple rows in front. Did she see me there? Did she know we were in the same theater? I never wondered that. Did I make a difference? Does it make one? 

I thank the sexologist for her answer. She didn't have to. She could ignore it. I'm not one of "her trans girls patients". She doesn't even know me. Why would she help me? 

I have the name and number of the endo. I could call him any time I want. I don't. I don't have money to pay him, I don't have my father's permission nor even my family's knowledge. 

I'd be taking another burden alone. I'd be doing it myself without asking for help. 

How can I tell them? How can I ask? Why does it freaks me and scares me and petrifies me? 

"Here with my men", she posted in facebook. Will she put another statuses like that tomorrow and the next day? Will she ask for pictures of "her men" in disneyland? What will Catherine and Anahi say if they hear? What will they think? 

Luis has just entered my room: "What does curry tastes like?" 

I motioned to the earphones in my head. "I can't hear you" I drew with my lips. He stood there and asked again. He knows I do hear him. He knows I'm ignoring him. 

I want him to notice me and I send him away. Am I scared he will send me away? 
Do I push people apart so I'd be alone by my own choosing? 

Is that what Catherine did when she deleted Facebook?

Today is Christmas eve. I am in my uncle's house. We've come to celebrate the holidays. I am sitting in the new dinning room with the laptop open on the table. I fell asleep in the way here. I was sitting in my seat with the earplugs in, it was unusual. It was like if I passed this permeable layer between consciousness and fantasy. Like my thoughts came to life. 

Yesterday I went out with Catherine. She came to pick me up and I waited for her with the jeans over my leggings. The gray dress was in my bag. I told my mom when I received her text message. I left like if I were hiding something. Maybe my dreams were what made me easier to the thought of telling somebody. 

I got in her car and saw her. We hadn't seen each other for a week. I wanted to be near her, hug her, feel her close. I reclined myself in her arm and pulled her closer. She gave me a present. "Happy Christmas" she said. It was a t-shirt wrapped in newspaper. A white t-shirt with the image of classic Mickey. The neck is a red line and the short sleeves are gray. That's the one I'll wear the day after tomorrow for Disneyland. I wanted to try it on. See how it looked with the bra and the leggings. I took the jeans off while she stepped off to the Oxxo. She bought condoms and I changed. She parked us in front of the store. People passed while I was topless and had the dress covering me. The idea of my father coming to the store, too, parking beside me and seeing me. Would he be surprised? Angry? 

He wouldn't be expecting to see me there. Would that impede him to actually notice me? 

Maybe that's the reason they don't see me. They don't expect to see what appears to them. I am a man, I don't wear make up. When I wear make up they don't notice. When I put women pants on, they don't notice. When I show them my hairless legs, they don't notice. 
Even Luis hasn't noticed. 

"I'll work in Hooters." "You'll have to razor your legs". 

I already do. Haven't you seen? 

I guess he has not. 

I put the dress on and took them off when we arrived. We undressed each other and held us in our arms. She lied over me and I almost came right then. After finishing each other off we showered. I put the clothes again. It feels different treating the clothes as just that. I don't have to hide or change. I can put the same thing with which I came. I can be myself. I put the make up on with her. We shared the mirror. 

There was something different this time. I didn't feel as comfortable as the other times. I felt... broken. The image was bad, foggy. I would still be exposed but it was different. She took us to the beach. We were going to eat in the same place were I took the leggings. It was closed. We got off the car and I was there. I showed myself even though I felt... 

It was closed. We got to the car again and decided to go to the sushi place where the guys gave us a taste that other time when I was wearing the skirt. We entered and it was empty. I had asked Catherine to order for us. I hate the moment when I open my mouth and they change the way they see and talk to me. They welcome us as two women, and when I talk they see me as something else. 

I should practice the way I talk. I should change the voice. I still feel like a person in disguise, like I'm lying. 

The waiter didn't use any pronouns. He talked neutral he saw us normally as any other person. The couple that got in after us didn't notice me. Maybe they did look and thought nothing. Maybe they just looked. 

We tried new things. A mexican roll, she ordered chicken tempura and I a yakisoba. 

I ended up eating my plate, more than the half of ours and half of hers. She was still hungry so I offered to go to the creperie. 

I could drink something hot. Maybe a chocolate, maybe a tea. 

The girls who were working there saw us and welcomed us. 

"Are you ready [neutral, masculine] to order?"

I heard and felt miserable. It was a confirmation. I looked like a man the whole day. Whom was I kidding? 

Catherine told me she did use the feminine adjective. 

I have no reason not to believe her. 

The school didn't call back. Is that the first rejection or does the factory counts, too? 

They didn't answer the first time. Does the second counts, too?

Tomorrow I have to wake up earlier than ever. Today is Christmas but it doesn't feel like it. This had to be one of the most boring ones I've ever had. 

I received two gifts. Catherine yesterday had none. She was the only one in her house who didn't open anything. Everyone, including her dog had at least one. We just talked about that before. She was sad, upset. There were a lot of things related. 

There were comments by some of her family. "Nobody remembers Cathy's indios". "What you need is a so called Ivan". 
How did he know about him? She had not said anything or made any comment to her family. "Facebook", he said. It couldn't be. She doesn't make any comments or posts about us. "That's what you told me to say" he said to his wife and everybody laugh. It was their private joke. She felt bad. She thought of herself as a bad person, a bad girlfriend. 

At that moment I was worried about her and forgot to think about myself. That was exactly what I was afraid of. I didn't want to be seen as her boyfriend. To put myself under more expectations. That's exactly where I am. They are more people to whom I have to come out and explain myself. 

"He is not Ivan, he is not my boyfriend". "If I didn't tell anyone I had my reasons. This was exactly why I didn't want to tell you. Because you can tell anyone". 

Merry Christmas. 

I remember thinking about Monica. Would she wish me something? What would I do or say? Did I really forget or was something that I made myself do? 

Christmas is almost ending, just like the year. In a couple of days they will publish the results of the Exam. Am I excited by that or scared? 

I had a debate with myself about what to wear.  Jeans or leggings? I was more and more convinced about breaking boundaries. Being there just like that. Show me and be me. 

I hate that phrase. "Show me" as if I were hidden. A part of me sees me like a fool in denial and the other as a corny teenager submerged in melodramatic bullshit. I am me. There are no masks or disguises just choices. Clothes and names. I am me. I have always been me. 

We were supposed to buy the tickets with the agency and just go. Pay and enjoy. That was it. It was easy and comfortable. That's the reason I told my own parents and invited my family. 

Anahi came with the proposal about buying the other tickets. They were cheaper. My father would save a little more than a hundred dollars. It would be a little more complicated but the price was worth it. 

Then, things started to change. Plans began to morph and everything turned to shit. There would not be tickets before the day. Anahi wasn't going to receive them, we would meet the lady before entering the park. Then there wasn't going to be 7 tickets but 6. Maybe she could buy the other one. Maybe... We didn't know. If not, everybody would have to complete the money that was missing for the new ticket. The last news was how there would not be any tickets at all. She would return the money to Anahi and we would buy the tickets online. Today in the morning Catherine called me to tell me how there was no money. The transfers system was not working because of Christmas. Anahi will have to meet the woman there in the park to receive her money. There was a chaos. How would we buy them? What would we do? What if Anahi decided not to go? I was desperate and frustrated and my head wanted to explode. 

I was irritated when my grandmother kept offering food. Didn't I want a piece of cake? I answered no and told her I don't like strawberry nor cream cheese. She kept offering, explaining how it wasn't so sweet and good. I wanted to scream at her. Stand up and tell her how I fucking hate her. I remembered that feeling when she grabbed my bracelet and asked me if it was weaved. I wished I had the rainbow one. I wanted her to see so I could tell her. 

I am gay. I am worse than gay. I am transgender and gay. Look at me. LOOK AT ME.

Is that what I feel, is that really the reason? 

When Luis told me he wondered if he was depressed the first thing that came to me was guilt. 
Why do I feel guilty? 

Maybe a deep part of me attributes myself the cause of it. Maybe I blame her for my own suffering. 

It's not her fault. She didn't pass it to me. My gender is nobody's fault. 

It's no hers nor the world's. 

It's not mine, either. It just happened.

Today I break the longest streak I've had. 

Yesterday I almost lost. It was a couple of minutes after eleven when I remembered. Anahi was asleep under Catherine's blanket. My phone had no internet connection. Hers did. We all were seated in a dark bus. The bus was half empty. Anahi had data I could borrow. I woke her up and asked her. She gave it to me half-conscious and I cheated. I could had written a thousand words with what happened. We were at disneyland. It was a these kind of days when I went there with Monica. It was different. Even though we parted ways, Catherine and Anahi spent some time with my family. They talked to Luis. Luis talked to them. We all rode some attractions. 

The woman with the money called Anahi a couple of times. She was rushed to meet her. I was a little desperate for everything to end. I felt Anahi's anxiousness. I shared it with her. 

"How should I refer to her? Do I call her Ivan? or...? She didn't tell me anything"

Even after she got her money, there was another situation. Should all of us stay together? Or I had to tell my parents we wanted to part? 

A part of me didn't want to make Catherine and Anahi to spend time with my family, being dragged to wherever they wanted to go, doing what they wanted to do. It was our trip first. But at the same time, I felt guilty leaving Luis alone with them. What should I do? 

Catherine asked me. I had to make a decision. It was hard. 

We picked different rows and entered at different times. We waited for them and watched the music band march in the entrance. When I went back looking for them I asked my mom. Told her we were a large party and maybe it might be easier if we went our separate ways. She told me my dad had asked her the same thing. 

The first half I was with just them. It was different when they changed pronouns and names. The first time Anahi corrected herself it was an uncomfortable relief. The first ride we went to was Pirates of the Caribbean. Catherine had never got in but Anahi and I had. 
I knew there were little drops. Little droplets of water wet some spots in our clothes. 

I was wearing the pants Catherine gave to me and she wore leggings. Anahi was in her baymax dress with red tights and a leather jacket. Catherine and I had matching t-shirts. I wore the black long-sleeved t-shirt underneath and the red long sweater over it. She had a black hoodie. 

The second ride was the haunted mansion. Neither of them had seen it in the holidays. They loved it. Catherine and I were in the same seat and Anahi rode alone. Maybe that's why she changed moods several times. I would had felt uncomfortable if I were with a couple. 

Once I felt mad at her. Why did she have to be that way? Why can't she enjoy herself? I was mad at myself. I remembered how I decided to take two pills that morning. Just now I remembered I didn't take today's. Why do I gamble with its effects? 

The third ride was one I had never got in. There were almost no line even though the park was full. Splash mountain. The little wait time we did I spent it in anguish. When finally we stepped of half wet I had a little feeling of pride. I did it. 

We met my family and separated again. We would meet in the afternoon to eat. We wanted to go to the Indiana Jones but it was closed. The aladdin one, too. We ended up buying a big turkey leg to share and Anahi and I some frozen treats. She a mickey shaped cookie and I a frozen banana. We watched the parade. 

We ate watching the show of the little kids training as padawans. The ride we all went to was the white mountain. Matterhorn. I closed my eyes the whole ride waiting for a big fall but there were none. Just tossing and turning. It might have been the longest wait besides Fantasmic. I saw Luis' eyes watering as he stepped out. 

We did end up buying churros. We ate them before watching the show. The lights, the fire, everything. It was worth the wait. 

The whole trip was amazing. 

I look at the pictures. I remember the trip back home. I rested my head in Catherine's shoulder. I think about how I used to remember the trip back with Monica. We were asleep, too, before I woke up and woke her with my hands and lips. My pants were wet. 

I didn't touch Catherine like that. She touched me a little but lighter. She brushed her fingers over my chest and thighs but that wasn't it. 

I was asleep over her instead of the other way around. She wanted to wake me up and whispered my name. She put her hand over my cheek and, in my sleep I put mine over hers. 

That is the sweetest memory of the trip.

Today's biscuits had cheese in them. The odor almost made me gag. Other days I would had felt rage or sadness. This time I just went to the kitchen and cooked two eggs with the fries and the meat of one taco. 

I showered a couple of minutes ago. The days are finally cold. I feel lost in the calendar. I don't know how to find myself in the present. I don't seem able to locate myself in time. I keep forgetting where in the year I am. 2015 is almost ending. A couple of days and is over. One week after that and I'll be 23. 

For a moment I forgot about looking for a job or looking for a doctor. Tomorrow I'll see Rene. He sent me a text message earlier today asking me if 11 in the morning worked for me. If it weren't for Catherine's reminder I wouldn't had remembered today is monday and tomorrow I was supposed to have the meeting with him. 

Of what will I talk? The thought about having to tell him something is a familiar one. The last time I went it was before the wedding. A thursday before the wedding of my uncle. So then, since then what I haven't done? I didn't tell my dad nor Luis. I didn't asked my mother about her comment to my aunt. 

What did happen? 

I went to the wedding. I wore the suit. It was longer than the time before. I used it for half the day. 

Before that. It was Friday. Or was it that same thursday? Yes. Friday was when we left for Mexicali. Thursday was when I decided to look for a doctor. I had a discussion with Catherine. I looked everywhere. I found a lot. I got the Facebook of the sexologist. I saw about the pilot treatment last year. I got a list of experts in the area. One of them was an endocrinologist. I had hit the jackpot when Catherine kept asking me about the page of the outdated NGO. 

I should talk on the phone. I must had called. Those were my only options. I had the name and number of the doctor. No intermediary, not some NGO or an expert who could point me in the right way. I had his name, his number, his place of work. I knew for a fact he treats trans people. 

I had him. Why do I kept feeling anger? Why was I still scared? Why was I more afraid than before? 

Was it then when I found the news about a person from Guadalajara who was in a march because the government didn't recognize his change of papers? 

That breath of hope was gone, too. 

I decided to go to sleep and cried in the sheets. 

Then it was friday, and after that saturday, the wedding. I was in m suit when I decided to send my resume. A factory and a school. A couple of minutes later I got an answer from the university. Monday I would had my interview. 

The wedding was a reminder of what I am not and what I will not have. Man and woman. God made a man and a woman. Fight for the sanctimony of marriage. Women should stand up, now men. 

My mother's men. 

There was no doubt in my clothes. Not even my hair. I was anxious and desperate as the night passed by. I got home and untied my hair and took the clothes off. 

My fathers comments the next day scared me. I should wear the suit again for the interview. I already planned to tied my hair. But the suit? Again? If I present myself like that, do I obligate myself to keep doing it if I get the job? 

Is gaining my life worth it if it means I have to live that way? 

I didn't got the call. Christmas was calm and mellow. The next day we went to Disneyland. I preferred separating myself from my family and it was a relief hearing my name from their mouths. 

The year is coming to an end. I use the excuse of the holidays to keep postponing what scares me. I am afraid of keep looking for a job. I am afraid of calling the doctor and making an appointment. What if I am rejected, too? What if I have to disguise myself but in the other way? 

For one I have to dress myself as a man with a suit and my hair tied. Even Edgar made the comment of how he thought I had cut my hair. 

"It's a returning vice". If he only knew. 

What if I have to go extremely feminine to the appointment, what if he thinks I am not trans enough? Do I have to paint myself and wear a dress? Do I have to use that name? 

How should I introduce myself in the call? 

People say how in job interviews even the handshake is a test itself. 

What if that, too, is a test which I'll fail?

"Look at the girl" 

"What is it that impedes you?" "I am scared. When I wear these clothes, if they see me as a man I have an excuse. The more I look how I want, the more it hurts when they keep seeing this other me." 

I woke up early. I dreamed something. I was in a school. I bought food, I think. I saw Jessica and maybe Chevo. I was mad at Catherine. I walked through a hotel room. Was I waiting for her? 

Today I had my last session of the year. Rene knows Magallanes. He's a doctor from the same university. "Does he treats them or is it just because he's an endocrinologist?" He appeared on the list. In a couple of weeks I'll have the answer of the sexologist. Maybe she'll confirm his name, maybe she'll give me another contact. Maybe I won't hear from her again. 

I was angry again with the lack of internet. I didn't receive any answer from Catherine since yesterday. I put the cell data and in the morning I received nothing. When my father knew he told me to check for a phone line. I called TELNOR and a voice message answer telling us to pay the bill. I had no credit anymore in the cellphone. I was off contact. Luis told him if he could buy us breakfast. He asked me if I wanted anything. Was it yesterday when they came with cheese? I asked him for chicken pieces. I wouldn't eat them anyway until this evening. I had plans with Catherine. 

I parked outside Rene's office. It was free but I walked towards the oxxo anyway. I payed the cellphone and bought 4 little donuts. I wanted a cup of hot chocolate but it was watery. The other one was diluted, too. I ended up buying a bottle of green tea. I ate the pastry there while I chatted with Catherine. The bottle I finished while I waited in the building. Again I took the flights of stairs. I was in the fourth floor when I saw the man with his baby. He was holding him and talking to him. Was him a boy or a girl? I thought he was a boy but she could well had been a girl. The baby wore yellow clothes and a little hat. The more young they are, the easier is for them to be anything. 

The baby and the man looked at me. I barely smiled and walked towards the corner. The baby kept looking at my way and the father turned, too. He said his phrase and moments later took the elevator or entered another office. Why did I smile? Did I like it? 

He wasn't wrong was he? If somebody who knew me were there they might had corrected him. Maybe they would had kept silent and laugh when he left. If I would had spoken he might had corrected himself. 

Do the rest of people see me that way, too? I was wearing women's jeans with a t-shirt and a hoodie. The jeans and the shoes were the only feminine think I was wearing. No, that's not true. The t-shirt and the hoodie were the only masculine things I was wearing. The coat is men's, too, but it looks feminine. That's why I bought it. The first time I showed it to somebody was... it was to Fien. She was with me when I bought it. 

We walked in Primark (is that how it was called?), she proposed separating ourselves so she could look in the women's section and I in the men's. There wasn't where I bought it. It was in Valladolid. A mall there. I picked it in one store we passed by. I bought a pair of shoes, too. I chose them because they looked feminine as well. I saw them thin and simple. I hesitated but ended up buying both. 

I left the big gray coat I took with me and brought home the black one I keep wearing. I liked how it was long. I like long clothes. 

After the session I drove to Catherine's house. There was her aunt and cousin. Was he his nephew? 

I noticed more the accents in her parents. Does she has it, too? 

They talked to me. Narrated some stories. I feel awkward and uncomfortable with the idea of them getting to know me. What will happen when Catherine tells them? Her mother already knows. 

She's like my mother. She knows but ignores it. 

How do their relatives see me? Did her aunt saw me as a girl, too? Is it just old people? Is it just men? 

Is it all just in my head?

Almost 15 thousand pictures. For someone who doesn't like them I sure seem to have a lot. 

Tomorrow will be the last day of the year. I have surpassed the last streak. I forgot their meanings. The first long one was the days I had been taking the antidepressants. The second one was the number of days I had since I talked to Monica. Was it? Really? Yeah, it matched. I talked to her because the count had gone down to 0. Then, in Halloween, before going out with Catherine and Anahi, we agreed to stop again. Break contact once more. Was it my idea or hers? I said it. She told me she wasn't ready to be my friend. I proposed it. I asked it. Did she want us to go back to not talking again? 

"OK", she said. 

Ok... 

Was that the last streak? Are these the number of days? 60 days since that? Yeah, it seems. 

The end of the year. How were we at the start of this year? We talked to each other. She was here still. She hadn't left yet to Paris. No, we stopped seeing each other by now. I didn't know it yet, but the last time we saw each other was before today a year ago. 

No, August was the last day we saw each other. We met in Plaza Rio. Catherine was with me. She stayed in the car. I got my book back and gave her hers. For a time I wondered what happened to that notebook I gave her. 

She kept it, she later would say. Was it true? Does it make a difference? 

A week ago I wondered what I would do if she talked to me this Christmas. Would I answer back? Would I ignore it? I congratulated her on her birthday in september. We were in silence then. I did. This time I could had done it again. No. I offered to stop contact. I can't start it. I should let it die. Our relationship is as dead as Ivan. 

We're not friends. She doesn't care. I should not miss her. 

I glimpsed through the thousands of pictures I have. Not even this last year. I have ones from 5 years ago. Half a decade. I saw so far away then. Even more. I was in high school. It's been almost 5 years since I left it. I remember how it hurt whenever she said those were her worst years. She met me there. We shared those days. Sure, we spent them arguing and in teenager's drama. It was hell for me, too. But I have to remind myself about those nightmarish experiences. To me high school was the time I spent with her. 

Jr high was my hell. And I had friends there. I met Zuri, I was known. No, it still was hell. Medrano doesn't count. I can't even imagine telling him about me. What would he say? How would he react? He tried to make contact before I went to Spain. 

Manuel and Mario. Mario was one of those friends. Now he is almost a doctor like Manuel. Manuel is almost half of the size he used to be. We both are almost non-recognizable. No, that's not true. I had long hair in high school almost all the way until the end. I exited it with a short hair. Even shorter than when I entered. I was mistaken as Alan's girlfriend a couple of times. I was thin like Manuel now. I was sick. Sick with sadness and hopelessness. I was fooled by denial. I thought hell ended in 4th semester but it was then when I knew how to deal with it and hide it. Monica helped me drown it. 

It wouldn't surface until those bursts of ire and melancholy. I'd keep it under control for another couple of years. 

"This is just beginning", Rene reminded me. 

I have changed so much. Even the start of this year. I had long hair. I was working in the Mental Hospital. And I look different. I feel so different. 

I can't shake those man's words. 

"Look at the girl", he told his baby. He referred to me as a woman. Did I applied make up? Yes, I was going to Catherine's. I was wearing women's clothes. I said it yesterday, the only masculine things were my shirt and hoodie. The coat was man's but european. 

They are no longer women's clothes. 

In my closet there is not a separation between men's and women's clothes. All of the clothes are mine. They are separated instead with the usual and secret ones. 

A part of myself is a secret itself. 

Hidden is intact and protected. 

It's not kept hidden because it's forbidden or horrible. I keep it hidden because it's fragile.

I close this year now. Every one that passes by is more difficult for me to differentiate them. I still think of this year as the one I went and returned from Spain. That was two years ago. Two years ago I started with all of this. Two years minus a week I wrote that entry in my journal. The one Catherine gave to me. The best present I've ever received. A bounded journal made by her. Pictures of us, the letter of acceptance, maps of where I would live. I filled it with my thoughts and fears and worries. 

Then I saw my life ending. I couldn't see further from my nose. I had no future. I had no hope. I returned with nothing. I left that problem in Spain. Last year I was here, too. But that was gone. I was cured. I was normal again. It was not two years ago. I made it go away. I ignored it again, buried it, hid it. It wouldn't resurface until months in. I didn't talk to Catherine again, like before until months into the year. We started going out in spring. This will be my first Christmas with this secret. I'll start this new year and the streak will begin once again. 

I feel a little pathetic remembering Monica and feeling the doubt of if she will say something being born in my mind. 

I should let it go. Why can't I let it go? 

"Do you think they would stop talking to you?", Catherine asked me about my mates from high school. No, I think they would not. Not Alan nor Diana. Roger and Omar even less. Monica I would think she would, but I can now know. I'd be alone. I'd be miserable and hopeless. I told her I would had wanted to know then. But, really, what would I do differently? I did the best I could. It's not fair blaming a little boy with the problems of an adult. 

I'm not alone anymore. I have friends. I have Catherine and Anahi. My mother knows and my father is here. He won't disown me. He won't hit me. He might not understand but he may love me. 

I should not fear that. I can do it. I can start this year with confidence and hope. I should, I must. 

I dreamed about a high school. It wasn't ours. It was in another country. Was it South America? I think of the letters CNDH. "Like the Human Rights?" Catherine would ask when I told her. Yes, but it was a high school. We walked to school. There were some streets. I was with her. Why were my parents there with us? I remember seeing Luis but he was smaller. He was a little boy. 

Yesterday I saw some of my earlier pictures. 2010 I think were the earliest. I had some of Monica. 2007. Was she fourteen? She was in Austin with her dad. I deleted most of them. Why didn't I erased all of them? Why would I want to keep them? I plan to delete most of them. I'll keep only the best ones. No, not the best. I won't delete them just because I don't like them. I would not keep any of them. I'll delete the most memorable ones or important ones.  I got to the christmas party of high school that might be the reason of my dream. Pictures of that time, photos of Luis being a little kid. He was a four year old boy sitting in my legs in my 15th birthday. In a week I'll turn 23. 

It seems surreal. Where did that time went to? I will never get it back. I spent them in those memories I despise. I spent 8 years in hell. Wast it 10? 15? 

When did I stop living? 

Did I even start? 

I will start. I have started. 

My life starts just when I began to really live it. It is my choice. It is my responsibility. I will do what I can do. Nothing stops me from keeping looking for a job. Go door to door and offer myself. I have their contacts, nothing stops me from grabbing the phone and making a call. Even if Magallanes can't help me, I might receive the message from the sexologist. I can ask her for help. I can offer a volunteering job with her patients. I can go to COCUT. I can ask for help or offer mine. I have the other names of the doctors in Ensenada. Nothing stops me from telling Luis and my dad. Their reactions is not on my control. I can't do anything to change those. Just I can let them hurt me. 

Nothing can stops me now. I won't let anything stop me anymore.
