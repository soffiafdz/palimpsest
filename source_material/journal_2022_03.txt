"Do you want to kiss me before I leave?"

I guess I am bipolar. Yesterday I took the first dose of the antipsychotic medication. This morning I kept chatting with some of the guys with whom I matched last night on Tinder. I wasn't even planning on meeting them. The first one asked me to meet him tonight. I told him then by asking him if he knew what the flags in my profile mean. Yes, that you are queer. I told him explicitly, then, that I am trans. Trans from where? When I clarified that I was born a baby, then a boy and now a woman, he unmatched.

The second one wasn't as sexually direct. I replied to him in French the whole conversation. He asked me to go for coffee sometime and thus I told him that my french wasn't as good and that I was trans. This is the time where you disappear, I said in French. I kept looking at his conversation every once in a while to check if he was still there. The last time I checked, he wasn't.

Jess picked me up close to ten. I recognized the familiar dying of interest when she kept messaging me often. If someone shows interest in me, automatically my subconscious looks what is it that is wrong with them. I saw her in the car and heard her voice and was surprised by how much I liked her. Same thing happened with Kate, which was the same thing that happened with Flore.

I sent an image of a meme to Héloïse of a conversation between a girl and a man having sex. The girl asks him to hurt her and he replies telling her that her obsession with books doesn't make her quirky nor intelligent, but it's only escapism from her life. Her look towards character development and relotionships in the stories are because of her inability to cultivate her own. I asked her if those were the kind of punishments she imagined those times. She said no. I just like to bruise their bodies, not their souls. 

"One of the times that I considered looking into bdsm, I was actually curious in the degrading stuff. Obviously pretend, and just in the sex act, not the 24/7 kind of thing. Now that I think of it, maybe it's the idea of having someone talk to me the way I talk to myself , just so I don't have to."

The message is still, to this point, unseen.

Amanda, the girl that suddenly disappeared that other time, hasn't replied to my texts trying to find a time for our date. After her silence I sent her one a couple of days ago, asking her if she would be interesting in going on a cute date like the one she talked about in her profile. The word date was not in my message but she implied it in her relatively quick response. I made no mention of the fact that I had seen she changed her profile sharing how she's very horny, or that she's more than 600 kilometers away. Everyone seems to be far these days.

Héloïse lives close to Quebec city. Salomé is away on a trip with her parents. Elise went to work in the same city upnorth where that girl from Facebook lives. Selin was on a trip to New York with her friend.

I posted a story in Instagram talking about the high price of my mood stabilizers and how maybe sending nudes to strangers or stalking French girls isn't so bad. Kate saw it. Alda commented that now is a sure thing that she won't respond to the fuckboy message that I was supposed to send next week. I don't think I wanted to anymore. Now I'm really considering just unfollowing her, if not outright block her.

I went to Ginksgo with Jess. We had breakfast and chatted. She asked me about the meeting with my psychiatrist and talked about her sisters and college life. When she brought me back home she showed me her puzzles. When I asked her the question, I noticed how she blushed exactly at the same time that I realized she was saying no. She's not comfortable with touching that quickly.

I couldn't hide my discomfort when I told her I understood before getting out of the car. We texted a little bit. She was worried that she had offended me. I mentioned again her plans of meeting again shortly before she leaves for her birthday trip. She said she would tell me, surely. And then the conversation ended.

Yesterday I got a snap from the threesome girl. A couple of days ago, after she replied to my story, I sent her one of the saved ones telling her that I owed it to her. She encouraged me to continue in a similar way to Emily's. I did. I brought up the fact that I was trans, and again she reassured me that she didn't mind.

"You're so freaking hot."

This time yesterday, when I replied to hers with another one coming right out of the shower, she didn't open it. She still hasn't. I don't know if she won't, like Emily.

"BTW, when you got locked out from your other account, how did you find me? Why did you look for me in the first place?"

I lost count of the number of people that I was making plans of seeing. There is one guy in Tinder who asked me out a couple of days ago and I considered rescheduling instead of saying no altogether. Was that how Kate felt about me?

I still feel irritated with myself every time that I type her name or mention her whatsoever. For a while I kept her stories mute and ignoring them successfully.

I saw the red circle around her BLM profile picture and clicked it even though I knew I would regret it. Regret it I did.

A couple of months ago, I remembered seeing a story of hers with a Mexican woman. I recall pretty well how it sent me through some jealous thoughts even though they absolutely weren't warranted. Today I was playing with the dating apps after I felt insecure with last night's house party in the apartment and Nico's only girl friend present. I opened her profile and saw she was 11 kilometers away from me. I kept that thought when I clicked on the eclipsed sun in her instagram. It was a video of water with some background music and the tag of her friend uptop. Girlfriend? Does it matter?

I went to her profile and saw the pinned stories. There were several from a couple of weeks ago in their place. And some from last week in Place des Arts. Around the same time I went with Kath ice skating. They did go up the ferris wheel that I saw with Alda when we walked Brioche there. I was craving the same poutine that I finally tried and ate with her at her sister's place.

Emily, the non-catfish and single mother, finally saw the messages I sent that she was ignoring. I muted her stories, too. She saw my messages little after that. She posted some today with a thong and then a very short one smoking a joint with the caption Yes. I am real. 

I sent her a cheeky message asking her, if she were indeed real, the reason why it said capricorn when she was clearly an aries. I didn't care that she'd know that I stalked her. I honestly believed she was catfishing me, I could explain it to her as the funny story it is, if she desired any kind of connection beyond interchanging purely physical pictures craving attention and the feeling of being desired.

Surprisingly, she did answer. She let the birthday as January 1st in there. I took the opportunity to present to her the questions that had been in my mind—other than you're not catfishing me, right?—all this time.

She saw them but said nothing. Not right then. Now there is a small blue icon telling me that there's an answer waiting for me. Do I really want it? I won't believe it anyway if there's anything other than dismissal.

Neither Héloïse nor Jess have seen the messages I sent a couple of days ago. Did I do something wrong? Amanda, after agreeing to the possibility of going on a date also hasn't replied back. Kath, on her part, did answer after a while, telling me she had a hard week as she broke up with her partner again. Instead of seeing it as a possibility of something—anything—happening between us, I sincerely felt bad for her. I don't think she's attracted to me. Why would anyone be?

"You're so freaking hot."

There were more than a hundred men liking my profile, even with the trans flag in the bio. Although not many straight men know the meaning behind it.

I swiped right a bunch of them and replied to a few, including a couple that, after telling them that most men feel uncomfortable with me being trans, reassured me that both were quite into it. I asked them if they speak English with the full intention of considering meeting them but neither of them replied back.

I am filling some void with these conversations. I am looking for something there, even though I am sure I won't find anything and end up hurting myself.

Why do I keep looking—stories, profiles, apps—, sending messages and asking questions?

Let's help each other feel a little less alone. 

...

"Hey lonely."

"Hey. Oh don't tell me you're not even a little bit lonely. Everyone feels alone these days."

"I want to make out with you; I hope you will invite me to your place."

"You know, this is the first time I have sex with someone without knowing their last name."

It happened, I guess, finally. I had sex.

I met Amanda at the italian caffetiera close to home. I was pretty punctual, entering the place at exactly 1430. I saw her sitting at the booth before I realized she had texted me she was there. I ordered a latte before joining her. We chatted for a bit and drank water. The conversation was nice, which wasn't really surprising since I liked her from that first night that we had those deep questions in Tinder.

The weather was nicer than usual—that's the reason she asked me to meet half an hour after the arranged time. So, when we got tired of drinking water after finishing our coffees, we decided to walk outside. Unintentionally, the route we took brought us back to the dog park at Dr Penfield. When we returned back downtown, after passing the window of a sushi place and talking about our trips and favourite foods, she asked me non-chalantly if I had any other plans later that day.

None of the girls from Hinge—Turkey, Eye Dr, JewishGirl—had replied back to my messages, and other than The Writer that I'd meet on Saturday morning, I didn't have any plans actually.

We went to get some food. I had just mentioned I've been enjoying asian food, and she proposed getting some Sushi. There was a good-rated place close-by. When we got there they asked us if we had a reservation—even though it was completely empty—and the ambience was of a very fancy place.

"What is your money situation, like?"

We—I?—could afford the food. We continue the talk about ethical non-monogamy and dating in general. We pondered out loud together, how would a three-way date would work.

I told her the stories about how I asked Jess if she wanted to kiss me and she said no and the time I didn't get the code of going together to the restroom. She told me to my face that she thought I was pretty. When I asked her to say more about it, she mentioned the way I helf my hand to my face and there was a small triangle formed above my eye with my lose lock of hair. I said how I was deeply focused in her eyes. They were green and looked as if they'd taste like herbal tea.

She told me to my face that she was attracted to me. Actually, how I reached out to her multiple times was one of the reasons she was. Calli had asked me if I had ever realized there might be someone out there who, instead of thinking I am needy or dependant, would read my insistence as interest and care.

We came back and came to my room. I hung my blue cloth mask at the door handle as an inside joke to myself. The next morning, Alda texted me asking me how it had gone and added a picture of the door. I guess I told both her and Armando about that, then.

We had sex. I ate her out and she did me, too. I am not sure if I made her cum, but she definitely enjoyed it. She kept grabbing my hands and moaning as I was caressing her hipbones while I was stroking her clit with my tongue. There was so much wetness that I could swallow her. She let me know that she was over-stimulated and would want me to penetrate her or go down on me.

Both happened. With Monica two fingers was too much. With Catherine, after the second finger, we'd move to the vibrator. Once, I asked her to use two with me. This is the first time that I used three. I didn't think of offering her using one of my toys.

She took off my underwear without flinching. She tried to lower the skin of my dick and I didn't realize she had done it before I warned her that it wouldn't go down all the way. I don't think she noticed how I was scared for a bit when I found it hard to get it back up. I read somewhen somewhere how, with phimosis, sometimes lowering the skin carelessly can lead to inflammation and lose of circulation. I would not want to look for an ER with an inflammed glans as a woman.

I didn't come, but she did get me hard. I offered trying to put it in after remembering the chat with Héloïse—she hasn't replied nor seen my last messages. She hesitantly brought up if I had a condom. Maybe my secure and quick answer reassured her. We couldn't put it in, though. So it didn't happen.

My favourite part of the night, even more than the sex, was the two of us just lying naked on the bed holding each other and, every once in a while, kissing softly on each other's heads.

I didn't know if it was expected or over the top, but I told her that she was welcome to spend the night if she wanted to. She didn't.

"I think I'll leave before I fall asleep", she said around half an hour after.

When I walked her to the door of my apartment, I asked her to text me that she had arrived safe.

"I'm sorry, I'm really bad at doing that, so don't think I died."

I didn't press the issue. During one of our earlier conversations, she mentioned me that she's really bad at texting and takes a lot of time to reply. As I told her when we brought back the subject in our second date of the day, that reassured me that it wasn't because of me.

Last night I went to Thomson House with the guys from the lab. As I walked towards the building, I saw a blonde girl with a beanie walking uphill with a plastic bag. I discarded the idea that it could be Vicky, just to realize that she actually was.

"I wanna see you completely naked. Can I? [...] You could be my extra naughty girl and slip away from the dance floor. Secretly snap me that sexy body."

"Why do you have this power over me? [...]I honestly thought you were a catfish after that first night before you said your account got locked. I still kept messaging you, tho."

I had so much to write that I even considered writing in my phone's notes application like I used to do some years ago.

...

Alda sent me some texts asking me to order an uber for her. At the bar, I had to transfer her some money so she could buy a round of shots since they weren't accepting tap and I didn't bring my CC with me.

The ubers kept cancelling her and she walk halfway to her building in McGill. I offered to bring her the coat that she had asked me hours before to take with me when I acompannied Nico home. I met her there at around 4 in the morning, after the time change.

I mentioned to her this morning how I had sent nudes to my catfish again because of insecurity feelings that awoke in my at the bar. I didn't tell her that the reason of that insecurity were related to my offhand comment I made the night before to her that Gabriela was hitting on her. She smiled and told me how she had noticed, but, I mean, she's 20 years old, she said.

I noticed it when she started asking for Alda and where she had gone, or how she took her by the hand inviting her to have some shots and drinks. I saw them walk away and felt a dangerous mixture of being invisible, left-out, and jealous. I went to the restroom and hid in a stall from my own thoughts. I had a message from Emily. I obliged and sent her several pictures before showing her my half-erect dick.

It didn't make me feel better about myself, but it masked the feelings I had for the rest of the night.

Karina is here. She came to work/study with us.

Last night I kept talking with one girl from Hinge. I had sent her a comment to her picture with the prompt caption this picture. 

"Rehearsal dinner of your soon-to-wed evil-twin."

She got back to me around a week—or more?—after. We kept chatting intermittently for a while. Last night, in one glanze at her profile, I realized her hometown was stated as South West France. 

"Oh wait, are you French?", I asked her right after a large message with several questions before she could answer them.

"Yes I am", was her only reply. At that very moment, I suspected that would be the last message that I'd get from her. I didn't know what else I could say other than Cool. 

Surprisingly, she did get back to me.

Now I also kissed Alda. Kind of. The two of us were dancing with Gabriela when Nico look straight at her and signaled a four to her. I did not see her reaction, but he grabbed me and Alda by the arms. That was the moment when I realized what he meant. How ironically that his intention was to kiss three women at the same time, and yet is the most gay thing that I can think of.

Alda moved away at first, but it didn't take much of him to convince her. I don't think I even felt any of their lips. I wanted to kiss Gabriela so much, that I couldn't help feeling guilty about my own desire.

Acéptalo, tío. Eres feo. 

I saw Gabriel pulling her arm when she started dancing with some unnamed guy at the bar. She kept grabbing both me and Alda, and I enjoyed feeling her hand and the warmth of the skin of her waist, that I realized that I wasn't much different than those strange men, taking advantage of a young and drunk girl.

I don't know why I had the idea that she was older. Lizzie and Karina, when invited to guess her age, both said how she looked so young. Their right guess of 20 years old brought a sting of uncomfort in me. I don't have the excuse of feeling horny since I am on these new medications and I had sex recently. Maybe it's just the shitty parts within me.

Beside talking to this new french girl, I also kept talking with Héloïse. Although she's fairly close to Montreal now, I don't think I will be meeting her soon.

I unfollowed Kate from Instagram.

Tomorrow I have the meeting with the psychiatrist. I didn't do much of the homework he left for me. I downloaded the books and look through the list he sent me. He didn't send back the form for the OSD. I guess I can ask him. 

How have I've been feeling with the new medication?

 Wanna come over? I can cook for you. 

"IDK how is it for you, but it does get old pretty fast to have empty conversations in here that most of the time don't really get to anywhere. Are you free this weekend? Do you want to get coffee and at least put a face to the person we're gonna potentially end up ghosting anyway? I'll pay."

I was coming home from the date with gamma, when, halfway here, I decided to get to the depanneur and buy some beer and chips. This is the first time that I payed for my other date. That's not true. I payed for Kate's coffee when we went to that last date. She payed for my indian dish at the previous one. I think I passed that place on my way home. There was a guy sitting in a table inside the empty restaurant. I saw him through the window pane and, moments later, connected the dots in my head. I actuall took a couple of steps back to see the place again.

It all started months ago when I commented on some girl's Hinge profile trying to guess the backstory of her picture. Today I got the real story behind it. I didn't even remember it was hers when she told me.

Like Kate's, I really have no clue about how the date went. Not really. With alfa, I knew how I felt but, apparently, didn't how she did. Beta, on the other hand, I was not sure how either of us felt towards each other. Still to this moment, here feelings and thoughts towards me—more then than now, at least—are a complete mistery to me. With Chloé now, on the other hand, as soon as I saw her I realized I was not attracted to her. I have no idea how she feels towards me.

There is something in me that gets invested in the other person as soon as I sit in front of them. It's happened every time. First with M, Minas, when I even considered asking her to come over, and then with every other girl since. I kept messaging both Nicola and Michelle, even though I am pretty sure I don't feel attracted to either of them. It's just, other than Kate, I haven't met anyone twice.

Jess hasn't seen the messages I sent her in messenger. She was saying how she was going to go on some chalet. Did I tell her the story about me being ghosted every time with a similar story?

After a couple of minutes chatting, even though I was completely worried about how the conversation would die, I noticed how I kept looking straight at her and my subconscious was unconspicously convincing myself that I wanted to be there, and for there to be something next, and that something next to happen with her specifically.

The conversation somehow flowed fine. She asked me for the time and two and a half hours had passed already. The same thing happened with Marie-Line. I didn't hear from her after putting to practice Kate's phrase of let me know if you wanna do this again. I probably won't hear from her either. She didn't lie to me, at least. Had she asked that question, would I text her?

Am I using this journal just to talk about the girls I see and, once every other year, have sex with?

Alda and I worked on our Bumble bff profiles. We talked about meeting people and maybe inviting someone to come over and play some games. I had a couple of matches but didn't really feel motivated to reply back. In a text, I told her how since there's no possibility of having sex, what's the point really?

I did, anyway. Reply, that is. I had a couple of matches on Tinder as well. On my walk home I sent two messages. One in english and another in—broken—french. I hope the last one knows english. She wouldn't be the first one to stop replying after I ask est-ce que tu parles anglais? 

The Soundbar arrived today but I had no time to install it before leaving. This time I wasn't late, but Chloé got there before me. She lives a couple of blocks over. I had no idea.

Coming over, I thought how, when Alda asks me how the date went, I would tell her that after not feeling it with this girl I at least could put an end to the joke of my fixation with French women.

I, instead, typed the message that I was convinced I didn't want to send to Kate.

"You look very pretty with your hair up [...] can I kiss you?"

The better I feel, the less I write. Yesterday I told Michelle—no, it was two days ago—or was it yesterday?—that I told Alexandra that I've been exchanging long and personal e-mails with my friends. Except that I haven't, not lately. It's been weeks since I sent the last one to Monica.

Looking up in here, I see more empty white boxes marking missed days than the green checkmarks. I went out last night with Michelle after my meeting with Louis. I met this week, as well, Monday if I remember correctly, with my committee. They like my project and gave me some good feedback and suggestions.

Louis promoted my software and told me half-jokingly that I wasn't good selling it myself. Was it humility or insecurity?

Wednesday I met with Alex. I finally went to Café Chat L'hereux. It was nothing special. Neither of us had gone before. I told her I had wanted to visit it and almost went there once, but there was a long line outside and it was rainning. I made no mention of with whom I was pretending to go.

Alex, Michelle, Kate, all of them study at Concordia. I removed Kate as a follower so she doesn't see my stories nor pictures anymore. Do I regret it? No. It's better to don't fool myself into false hope that one day somewhen out of the blue I'll receive a message or something from her.

Talking about messages out of the blue, I woke up to a message from Héloïse in Whatsapp. Just yesterday I was thinking about messaging her or what she was up to as I walked back from the metro station. I decided against it. What could I say? I want to see her and meet her, but when she was here herself, she told me how she was so busy with schoolwork and personal errands that meeting with me was impossible. The idea that was barely forming in my head about telling her that I have now a communauto account and thus the possibility of renting a car and driving to Quebec City didn't materialize. I didn't get to the point of wondering how I could ask her if she was free a weekend anytime soon.

And I just did.

"Y qué estabas pensando?"

...

I should shower, probably. Today I don't have a date, but I'll meet with the OSD advisor. When I talked with Calli about it she told me how I was partly correct. Most of the students that get services and facilitations from OSD are undergrads, as the relationship with our PIs is the most important one with us graduate students.

I guess it was a good idea to tell Louis about my recent diagnosis and mental health.

I'll meet with Catherine tomorrow. Not that Catherine. This one is a physicist living half-an-hour away from here. We agreed to meet in Place-des-arts to go to Lola Rosa. She's vegetarian, so I suggested that place as it's vegan. I loved the nachos when I went there with Kory.

I sent a message to Anahi telling her how I am most excited about that one—there's an irrational worry just now back in the corners of my subconscious that just because of this, it won't get to happen—but I don't know how to feel with the idea that she's named as my ex.

After the Café, Alex asked me if I was planning to get back to work or if I were free for the rest of the day. When I told her that I, indeed, was free all day. She suggested we go grab a drink. The cats were cute, but there were several times when we felt the whole place going quiet and our words bouncing back from the walls.

Did I pay for both drinks? Probably I did. She asked for the uber that took us to Crescent. Crescent is the street where Hurley's is, the bar where Vix's friend works. Alda and I have gone there a couple of times. Alex and I entered to Brutopia, a few places down the street.

I met her at the café at 3pm and we walked towards Concordia campus at 9pm. She was going to take the shuttle to Loyola campus. One point in our way she intended to separate but ended up walking with me. She mentioned my skirt, that I looked cute, but still I must have been cold. She was. She invited to come inside while she waited for the bus, but it was already outside. We walked right back and we said good-bye. Both of us had our masks on still, when she asked if she could kiss me.

I put my hand behind her neck instead of on her cheek. I played with two locks of curls and it was as if I could feel the blond color in my fingertips. She asked me to text her that I had arrived well. I did.

"You know, I wanted to kiss you, but the last time I thought 'I'll just ask; the worse she can say is no', she did just that. Haven't gotten over it, honestly. Hope you didn't want to and nothing was lost."

Catherine was an hour late. 

I see the vast majority of white boxes compared to green ones and I can't help but think that I might just come writing here when I have a date or am over-thinking about a woman. 

I was expecting Alda's question about how it had gone. How did it go, indeed. 

I wore my heeled boots and a black skirt. Alda saw me leave and complimented it. It was 5 degress outside but the tights kept me warm enough. In my head I rehearsed what I could answer if she were to ask me why I had worn a skirt or if I were cold. I couldn't put on make-up nor shave because of my appointment with the skin doctor, the least I could do was try to wear a cute outfit for you.  

She texted me to say that she was on her way and would arrive around 15:15. I mentioned how I had my camera to kep me busy. Keeping busy I tried for the 30 minutes before her ETA. 

I payed a big portion of the Laser treatment. I told Alda later that night the story of how I was so high that I was going to tip 150 dollars to the doctor. Fortunately she corrected me and put it towards my balance. 

She eventually sent me a text telling me that she had found a parking and, if it wasn't reserverd, she'd join me promptly. Time started passing and I started feeling colder. I went inside and asked for a table for two. They asked me if I had a reservation and I felt guilty for my lack of thinking. That happened the other time with Michelle, during our first meeting. They did sit me and I ordered a latte. 

I was considering texting her if everything was alright. I had written down the question when I received her text saying that the previous spot was, indeed, reserved, but she had gotten another one and was finally on her way. I finished my coffee. 

After she waved to me from the entrance, when she sat down in front of me and took off her mask, I saw the figure of her mouth after her smile dissipated and was barely conscious of how my head was busy looking for flaws or manners that I would find unnattractive. 

She had a marked french accent in her speak, but I found it intoxicating. It wasn't as strong as Flore's but still more present than Kate's. At that moment, after the subconscious comparison, I started fearing that she—but more importantly I—would follow that same fate of ghosting/fixation and eventual emotional mourning after counted encounters. 

She talked most of the date, but didn't seem to mind it. I didn't. It was refreshing not to have to worry about silences. I hadn't eaten all day and we kept postponing ordering food because she was too distracted telling me about quantum physics and qubits in quantum computing to take a look at the menu. 

After eating I glanced at the drinks menu and asked her if she wanted to order something else. She said no and instead we asked for the bill. I worried that it would be the end of our meeting and we had not touched the subject about our expectations of the date. So I brought up the subject when we started walking outside. I prefaced my question stating that because she was going to leave the country in a couple of months I assumed she wasn't looking for something long-termed. She corrected me to say that, even though she was indeed close to leaving, it didn't change what she was looking for. She doesn't have strict expectations but she's not the type of person for going for one night stands. 

Her words reminded me of Amanda and our three-dates-in-a-day. Would that count as a ONS? It all depends if I see her again or not, I guess. That thought made me confuse the ideas of ONS and sex on the first date, and thus, felt a little dissapointed with her statement. 

We kept walking. When we passed a park, I asked her if she was going towards her car already. After she answered no, I proposed to change direction and redirect towards the park. We continued walking and chatting until the sun set and it was completely dark outside. We talked about hiking and trekking, videogames and movies. 

I asked her if she had fulfilled her expectations for the date. When we eventually found her car, after twice she asked me if I was sure I wanted to continue following her—was she subtly hinting me towards leaving? I actually asked her but she didn't admit it. 

"Can I give you a hug?," I asked her before leaving her. 

She hesitated at first and mentioned something about me being willing due COVID before opening me her arms. 

I texted Alexandra on my way home. This morning, I texted Amanda and Kath. 

I have the phone facing down as a way to convince myself that I don't really care about getting responses from any of them.

"I'm so sorry for taking so long to reply... I'm free this week (in the evenings) if you still want to meet."

"[...]Hey, sorry I didn't respond earlier. I had a lot of fun this weekend, you are an incredibly wonderful person, however I don't think a romantic relationship will work between us. I want to wish you all the best in that respect."

I received today an automatic e-mail that made everything worse. Melissa's e-mail yesterday talked about her patient's mother death and how with her parting, all of her love went away.

My mother is dead, and everything is worse now. 

I feel like crying right now. It's not the e-mail about the candidacy exam, but about not being ghosted. How silly that had I been ghosted as I thought I was, I would not be feeling this way.

Yesterday I texted Alexandra and we agreed to meet this coming Friday, she'll come here and we're going to watch The worst person in the world. I offered her the option of seeing it in the theater or here, she chose the latter as she like the idea of it being cozy. Nico won't be here, Alda said, after I told her, that she could get lost and go to her sister's. I know I shouldn't expect it, but it's pretty obvious that we'll probably end up having sex. She knows I am trans. She knows that I'm not looking for anything serious nor exclusive. 

Salomé, the other girl who I was completely sure I wasn't going to hear from again, sent me a message. It's been two weeks. She offered to meet this week. I was just telling Alda how I need to dial it down with the dates and expenses and yet I said yes. 

I have two dates this week. If any one of those two, or even any of the others that I've seen were the ones that had rejected me instead, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have stung this hard. When the first quebecoise girl sent me that message as I was eating something with the guy from Queretaro didn't feel like this. It stung, of course, but I don't remember feeling like crying. 

It's the opposite of being ghosted. She apologized for the silence, was open about not being attracted to me. Complimented me as a person—albeit a little patronizingly to my taste—and even accepted continuing talking. Why do I feel this shitty? 

... 

"Te gusta que te digan que no."

"No, o sea, sí, pero la verdad esta vez sí me caló. En serio, sin chistes, sí ando un poco adolorida. Incluso en mi putería y en mi etapa sexual freedom, 0 attachments creo que sí te dije que esa cita era la que más me emocionaba y hasta mi roomie se fue a su cuarto porque vio como me cambió la cara cuando le estaba contando de la francesa que me de-ghosteó y le dije que me esperara y empecé a sonreír cuando vi la notificación con su nombre antes de leer la segunda mitad de su mensaje donde me rechaza y se me borró la sonrisa.

"O sea, fue una cita; soy totalmente consciente que ni siquera me gustó ella como persona porque no la conozco. Pero aún así, no lo sé; estoy sensible.

"No es la primera vez que me rechazan ni será la última, pero esta vez es poquito diferente. Y sentí rarito, porque es la primera vez que lloro después de los nuevos medicamentos y es como, no es por hormonas o depre o el vacío existencial de siempre, es pura tristeza. This is new to me." 

Don't see this as rejection, it's just in person it's not a romantic match. 

Never worry about yourself though. You don't need to change yourself for others, you just need to find someone the loves you as the great person you are. It's just, you know, we can fake love. You're perfect just as you are, even without makeup or shaving. 

... 

I got an email from IPN today about how the first attempt of the candidacy exam has to be before April 30th. If after that date I haven't had it, it will be marked as a Fail.

I drafted a new doodle poll within the last week of April and sent a couple of emails to Louis. I drafted another email to Boris asking for a meeting next week in order to talk about OSD. 

I'll meet Salomé this Wednesday for a drink in Vieux Port.

"[...] I've really enjoyed talking to and hanging out with you but I don't think this is really going anywhere for me[...]"



"Don't remember if I told you. I had this idea of a date of walking up MtRoyal to see the sunset atop and wandering there at night. With spring coming, would you like to do it w/me one of these days?"

"That sounds nice, I would like to do that with you."

...

I've been feeling sad again. After last night, I felt like crying today again, but this time it wasn't because of a woman. I sent the email to the committee and to Boris. Some filled the new Doodle poll. Only Danilo and Boris are missing. There is just one option from the ones that I gave that works for the three people that have answered. I am starting to feel anxious and frustrated.

Louis offered to meet tomorrow. He gave me the option to talk to him today, but I was already waiting for Dr Perera's appointment. Before that I went to the pool and swam for a while before going into the sauna. My stomach feels weird. It's the fourth or fifth time that I've gone to the restroom feeling gassy but can't relieve myself.

Pool, Dr. Perera, Photography club and Laser hair removal. I'll meet with Louis tomorrow morning. 10 hours exactly from this moment. I went to get some cash for the Sugar Shack later this week. Catherine was the girl who told me she was going to go to one. It feels weird typing her name. I replied to her text in the very early morning and she hasn't replied. Probably she won't. I, honestly, maybe, really hope she won't. From the bank I walked to McGill and went to the photograph club office. The door was closed. I asked the guy sitting in the table next to it if he knew if there was anybody inside. I sat and read the paper Louis had sent this morning to pass the time before my appointment.

At the laser hair removal session I was treated nicely. When I paid the rest of the balance they charged me without taking into account the 150 dollars I gave as a tip last week. I did notice but didn't have the courage to say anything. As if that wasn't enough, I turned the contract they gave me and it stated in caps MAN, before the number of sessions. I threw it away when I got home. Reading it hurt even more than the burning pulses under my skin.

I'll see Salomé tomorrow afternoon. I made a reservation this time. I feel nothing. She could cancel, she could leave me stranded and I wouldn't really care. Part of me this exact moment is wondering what would happen if I'd just cancel. There are two options floating in my head, either that would save me the rejection or the awkwardness of having to pretend interest until she loses hers. I don't seem to even consider the chance that we'll both like each other.

It's not exactly like that with Alexandra. I am a little excited of having her here. She's the last woman I kissed. Or did she kiss me?

Will I see Amanda? She might reply later this week. I thought about appending to my last message that I am, in fact, free in the weekend. It's better like this.

Are those all of the girls? I should disclose my trans status before meeting anybody. I don't want to go through the same thing with Catherine again. Why, why did it have to be like Flore? Would I have felt the same if, instead of just disappearing, she had done that same thing, rejected me openly and directly?

I liked Amanda. It wasn't just the sex. I liked the conversation, I liked the day we spent together and the night in my room. I liked her taste and how it hurt when she pressed hardly on my back and bit on my neck.

Will I be sad if she never replies back either?

...

What else could I write about?

Monica, like Melissa, replied to my last email about the photograpies.

"Sí, tal vez habría sido incómodo para la chica que le pidieras una foto. Tal vez si hay una segunda cita le podrías platicar lo que has hecho con tu cámara."

I felt tempted to reply right then and there and tell her how she was the one that rejected me, and the one whose rejection broke me a little in a way that none of the others had managed to.

I didn't. I don't want to talk about it again.
