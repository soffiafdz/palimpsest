"You should come to my place next, maybe next week; make use of the fact that I still don't have roommates yet."

I asked Alexandra if  I could walk her to the bus station. We kissed good-bye and she had already parted away when she turned around and returned. I'll kiss you again before leaving. Right now my anxiety would tell me that it was a sign of her not planning of seeing me again. Only for the fact that she was the one to suggest to see each other again and she replied to my text. 

I sent an email to Louis asking if he had heard any news from Sylvia. I didn't see his first response telling me not to feel anxious and that we'd figure it out. His second response—the one that I saw—was him telling me that Sylvia said yes and to tell everyone to hold the date. I send the first email just to IPN and Louis, since it was the one that worried me. Most of them have confirmed by now the calendar. I'll be having my candidacy exam on May 17th. I am still not sure if I want to schedule another meeting with the Learning Support guy. 

I was originally supposed to meet with Alexandra on Friday. I showered and prepared mentally for it when she texted me asking if we could postpone it to Sunday. She would not be getting out of the lab soon and when she would she'd probably be very tired. She offered me the choice of moving it to Sunday—either her place or mine—or she could come at around 9pm. After thinking about it for a bit I told her to come Sunday.

Saturday I did nothing. 

I'm coming from the balcony with Alda.

Now I'm sitting down with two glasses of Mamajuana in front of her. We are each lightened from the screens of our respective laptops. 

What was I writing about? 

Yesterday I sent Alexandra a text asking if she was still up for our meeting. She replied asking if 2pm was OK. I showered and went outside to the park to meet with her and bring her in. I got distracted and took a picture of the plant in the patio of that house across the park. I heard my name after trying to remember the aperture and speed of the shot for the film log. I showed the place before we sat down to watch The Worst Person in the World. Around her first or second trip to the restroom she asked me if I had a blanket. I am not sure if she was actually cold or her try of sitting again even closer. Must be. After the pizza came, I sat right next to her. Under the blanket, I laid my leg uptop hers and felt the warmth of her full arm pressing mine. In the middle of The House she wrapped her arm around me. I fully laid my bodyweight on her and pressed my head on her shoulder. I was conscious of each one of her fingers on my arm. I was doubting if this shift wasn't instead during the first movie, but it wasn't. I remember the exact point during the second fragment of the The House when the seller is at the hospitial after injuring himself with the bug repellent that I for a moment forgot if it was my turn to inhale or exhale in my breathing. When we shifted again I surrounded her. I made a comment how nice her hair smelled and went towards it to kiss it. I heard a couple of small laughs but I am not sure what they meant. She lifted her face and I met her lips. 

After the movie ended and I wasn't sure if she were to stay or leave we kissed again. This time I kept at her neck and felte each of the fingers—in her other hand—wrapping my breast. 

I sent a text to Amanda asking her if she's still up for our sunset walk this Wednesday. If it happens, it would be after she replies tomorrow. If she doesn't answer back, then it won't. 

I had a meeting this morning with Eduardo. I told him about being bipolar and my difficulties managint time and proyects. He was understanding and warming.

Nico came back from her trip to Ontario. 

I told Alda at the balcony that it all started with one dying plant and now we have our own full garden.

 Do you want to get coffee and at least put a face to the person we're gonna potentially end up ghosting anyway? 

Two nights ago I walked 18km with Amanda. I thought my idea of going to MtRoyal was something cute and original. I was the sixth person with whom she did that exact thing. She grabbed me by the arm when we were at the belvedere. We didn't kiss up there.

Before getting there, we passed a view of the city. I offered my phone to her so she could take a picture. I sent it to her today. 

For a moment I thought she was going to leave me stood-up. She warned me that she had missed her bus and would walk there, arriving in around 45 minutes. I had already left my apartment but since I had my camera with me, didn't really mind. As I got closer to Jeanne-Mance, my camera's shutter started getting stuck. When I arrived at our rendesvouz, I decided to just take the roll out and try to fix it. After that, I sat at a table listening to music. 

"I'll tell you some things and just tell me if you like them or not [...] I'm just trying to see what else we can do later."

She invited me to the drag show that she and her roommates would put at their place. It was supposed to be today. She'd send me the details by Facebook. I knew we didn't have each other, but maybe I said nothing.

We walked to a Tim Hortons and she asked if she could buy me the doughnut. When she told me it was time for her to start walking home—and reassured that it was not towards my place, but her own—after we hugged I asked her if I could kiss her. We did. 

Yesterday I found her on Facebook and sent her a friend request. I regretted it. Maybe I thought about Flore and that rejection. Although I wouldn't see it until hours later, less than a half an hour after I added her, she sent me a message on Tinder saying that her phone is dead and they were probably going to cancel the show. In any case I could find her in Facebook as Amanda Brennan. I didn't see her today. I won't see her until August—if ever. 

I sent a message on Monday to Alex asking her how her lab work was going. She didn't reply. I sent another one yesterday, telling her about the Japanese festival that is happening, in case she still wanted to meet this weekend. That one, too, is still unanswered. 

There is no difference in case we were to see each other if she had replied to those messages or not, yet it still hurts. Is it the vagueness of being ignored? Is it the threat of abandonment that aches more than the rejection itself? 

In my session with Calli I told her how I feel as if I'm distracting myself with these women, but from what? 

I went to get two of my three rolls of film developed. I bought two new rolls. The rest of the afternoon I spent it at the anticafe, working. I regret those two decisions. 

I'm drinking right now. I feel a bit like crying, but I am not sure the reason behind it. 

Am I sad because of Amanda's departure? I'll probably see her in three months. 

Is it the unresponsiveness of Alexandra? On her whatsapp, it appears that the last time she signed on was Wednesday's afternoon. She must be busy. Even if she were uninterested... I'll either get an answer this weekend or next week, or the week will pass and I'll feel better after moving on. 

Maybe it's that I don't have any other girl to distract myself with. Do I even want to go out? I am supposed to be busy with my candidacy exam. I could text Salomé, Alda told me to do it, and yet I didn't. I don't really feel like going out. Why am I this upset, then? 

What the fuck is it that I want?

Neither the psychologist nor the photography club have replied either. 

I was annoyed wiht IPN after they took so long to answer my questions, and even more when the head of the department falsely told Louis I had gotten reminders that never actually came. 

What is it with me that I am so easy to ignore? 

I posted on Instagram a picture of me without a bra. I guess I am famished for attention.
