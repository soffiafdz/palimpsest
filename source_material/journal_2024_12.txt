 I miss the idea I built of you.   It's been sneaking in for a couple of days, but I was expecting this since almost two months ago. It was long due.

I went yesterday to the office after skipping the whole week. I was sick for most of it, but it did not stop me from actually going outside the house. I met Alda to go pick up a gift for Paty, I met with Aliza to celebrate her passed candidacy exam, I went with Majo to make use of the two tickets I bought for the festival triste.

Today, I stayed home for both my sessions with the psychiatrist and with Fabiola.

"I... I don't feel depressed yet, but I feel it coming. I think I'd like to increase the dose."

He looked as if he was faking a face of compassion and understanding. We went from 150mg to 200mg. I received the call from the pharmacy and I requested to have the six weeks and the other month of my hormones and antiandrogens. That would be precisely enough to last me the whole winter break.

I do not remember if it was before my session with Fabiola or after, that I heated some beef and rice for breakfast. When I took out the tupperware containers from the fridge I noticed the months old cans of beer and cider. Have I really not drunk at home in all this time?

I feel tempted to grab one. Even the water bottle filled with Albanian liquor that Alda brought me from her last trip home feels appetizing.

"How about your romantic life?" asked me Fabiola after I said that everything has been going well at the office and with my friends.

Do I want to write in here how before this sentence I stopped writing and went for two sips of raki? I opened the fridge and realized that it was only a deceiving wrapper rather than a leftover can of cider. I considered grabbing the older—and much stronger—beer. I have to leave in an hour. I do not think I will be able to finish it nor that it would be a good idea to arrive at Aliza's noticeably drunk.

Yesterday, rather than sadness or melancholy, I was in an easily-distractable and irritable mood. I got angry with Sonny when, after I had repeatedly told her to just give me a quantity to deposit her, she started over-explaining again after giving me an initial number which I finish transferring by the moment she was in the middle of arguing for me to send her more money. I realized I was not rational, and thus I told her it would be better if we stopped talking. Later that night I apologized by telling her that I was aware I was not being fair, but I still did not want to speak.

Thursday Aliza proposed me to go to her house to put her up to date with my latest dating phase. I guess by now it is over. I have deleted my Tinder account and hid my Hinge one. Both apps are no longer in my phone. I will not be seeing Sarah again this year, and probably it will be the same with Clara. 

It was probably the night between Saturday and Sunday, when she replied to latest messages that I had sent her earlier that same night asking her about her peruvian friend's food and sharing about the short films. She told me the details she had omitted about her latest housing problems. She continued talking about her long night working that same day and finishing with a question about the shorts, half-way twisting it to a request for recommendations. I had my phone in my hands and saw each message come up live. I hesitated but replied immediately. Both my responses that night and the message I sent her yesterday asking her if she would have a free evening this week are unseen. 

As soon as I sent the latter, I regretted it. 

Her latest messages were both a long vent—her own words, not mine—about her roommates and how they need to find two rather than just one replacements, and here long working hours. And my response was asking her to see me. It is not just selfish, but tone-deaf. I deserve to remain ignored. 

I lost count of how many times I have muted and unmuted her conversation. 

I start feeling the raki warming up my face.

 I shut close the drapes and turned off the lights.  I took cover under the cold sheets, hiding myself  from the coming storm within me.   I woke up early enough that I could have gone to the office. I turned off the alarm instead.

In my calendar I had but a single event. Today was a talk about the process of submitting the thesis. It was scheduled to start at noon. I barely made it.

I made myself a glass of coffee with the last paper filter I had left. I sipped it while I half-heard someone talk about the steps I would need to follow in the upcoming year.

I don't remember if it was before or after the talk that I shut off my phone.

The only light inside my apartment is the desk lamp behind this dark screen. Even if the curtains were open, it is dark outside despite being still too early to drink.

I ran out of fingers to count the times I have cried today.

I had something to eat, so my stomach was not empty when I went back again to the reused water bottle almost filled with Alda's Albanian rakia. 

I feel the warm fruity breath with every sip I take.

Last night I drank enough that when I tried to speak at the pharmacy, my words would drag and stumble upon themselves. I sent a text to Majo confessing I was drunk before even getting to Aliza's. Her worry urged her to call me. I declined her call and lied saying I was alright.

I do not know if it was noticeable enough for Aliza.

We had plans, María and I, to meet today after work. I cancelled on her. I postponed it to tomorrow. I asked her to buy coffee filters for me, maybe unconsciously pushing me to actually meet with her tomorrow.

A couple of hours ago, when I turned the phone and got out of bed, I grabbed Albert Camus' book and started reading it. I had not yet started drinking. By now, I have probably drunk more than last night. I do not know if I am trying to hide from my emotions or push them out.

There are, here and then, small murmurs coming through my headphones, interrupting the background music I put to drown my thoughts. I do not know where they are coming from.

Last night, Aliza and I ate burgers at her house. I got myself a poutine with mine. After talking about the girls I have gone out on dates these past few months that she was busy with her school work, she reciprocated by telling me in her words what I have been intuiting regarding Steph.

I do not know if she noticed I am starting to drown or I was already self-medicating with alcohol. I suspected María might have warned her. When I asked her directly, she denied it. I have no reason to doubt her.

I turned back on my phone. I could not last more than a couple of hours. It has not loaded yet, and I am feeling anxious about the idea of everything remaining empty. No new messages, no new notifications or unreceived messages. An absence that nobody noticed. A tree that fell in the forest without making any sound.

I keep drifting off—from these words, from my own feelings, from reality?—but I am back.

I scanned two or three rolls. I watched the first half-an-hour of Lucía y el sexo. I got drunk with the memories of my last kiss and little sips of alcohol from an old water bottle.

Last time I turned on my phone I had the picture from Sonny for the transference to Misael. There are some reels or images in the conversation with Majo and Aliza, maybe another one in the María's.

I am not sure if the Christmas lunch is tomorrow or Friday. I think it is the 6th. Tomorrow I will meet with Louis and then with María. The day after I will go to the lab's lunch and will probably have a good-enough time. Next week I will be waking up in another bed. The week after I will go back to not sleeping alone.

Have I run out of tears already? Or are they just hidden from me.

Why am I thinking about motherhood?

Why are the faceless children I dreamed of, with curly and blonde hair, coming to me now?

I am not capable of making life; only death resides within me.

 I reach for the night we invented love, but the stars blur, their edges unspoken.  A memory fading between dream and shadow, a moment unraveling in silence, its heartbeat dimmed, its warmth scattered like ashes.  Tell me—did you feel it too, this quiet undoing?  Or is it only me, grieving a ghost I can no longer hold?   I am waiting right now.

I am waiting a couple of months before my PhD defense; a couple of days to travel to Mexico and see my friends, my family, my dog again; an hour before walking to station Jarry to meet with Clara and bring her to my place.

Earlier this week she told me of the possibility of meeting Saturday—yesterday—if her long-planned trip to Quebed were not to happen. She explained it probably wouldn't. My replies to her text remained unseen the following days. I tried to convince myself that whatever happened, whether I saw her or not before January would be alright. I went to bed Friday with the sketch of hope about waking up in the morning and reading her text proposing a time. When I looked at my phone throughout the morning, it always remained empty.

I was venting with Majo about my disappointment and sadness and even irritation. She asked me what was it that made me upset.

"cuz it takes 10 secs to write sorry, i can't saturday/tomorrow/today; or not just that, opening the conversation.

"i feel like an afterthought, and i deserve more than that."



It probably was not more than an hour before the notification came. She laughed at the photography reel I had send her, and told me how she had just seen it the day before and thought about me. Then, she said her trip to Quebec had not happen as expected, so we could do something chill at around 6 or 7 if I were still down for it.

I told her to meet me at Station Jarry at 7. She confirmed it, and I continued with my day.

There was still a sense of uneasyness, something didn't sit well within me.

It might have been the night before. I was thinking about my plans for our date—were it to happen. I thought about the questions game that Alda and I used to play. You see, the point of the game is to come up with unanswerable questions; something so deep or personal, that you rather lose a point than to share an answer. As a follow-up thought, I thought of examples of potential questions.

How was the time you lost your virginity? 

I was lying on my bed, face over my pillow and my body under the duvet. I froze.

"i just realized i can't remember when/how i lost my virginity, and words can't describe the sudden grief i am experiencing rn cuz of it."

Fifteen minutes before the alarm I had set on my phone to signal the time I would need to start getting my stuff to leave started singing, I got a voice message from Clara. Its length of almost a minute was the first bad sign.

"Hi Sofia," it started with a voice that despite easily recognizing, felt new and adventurous.

There were also tiredness and pain embroided in her words; that was the second bad sign.

She proposed an exchanged, maybe we could meet this afternoon rather than that night, go for a coffee or whatever I had planned. Of course, if I was not available, she would definitely make it, albeit just a bit later since she needed to sleep some more.

How could I dare to force her to see me, even if I were to have plans today?

"Thanks you are an angel" she finally said.

In less than 30 minutes she's supposed to be arriving.

This morning I reach out as promised and shared my plans for last night, and an alternative option referencing her mention of getting coffee. In the afternoon, she picked my original plans with the exception of the wine, and proposed meeting at 16h. My response confirming remains unopened.

I feel nervous. I feel still unconvinced that it is happening.

This is going to be our fourth date. I don't think I have ever come this far with anyone after Sonny.

What is it with women I have kissed that I rarely see them again?

I have listened to her audio several times. There is something sweet in how she pronounces my name.

"...and it makes me feel as if i'm the one who's been pronouncing it wrong all these years."
