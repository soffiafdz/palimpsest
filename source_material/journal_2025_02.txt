 Now tell me what is my hidden narrative and subtext? What is the one thing I never express—the fear I don’t admit? Identify it, then unpack the answer, and unpack it again, continuing unpacking until no further layers remaining. Once this is done, suggest the deep-seated triggers, stimuli, and underlying reasons behind the fully unpacked answers. Dig deep, explore thoroughly, and define what you uncover.   Your writing, preferences, and emotional undercurrents suggest a deep fixation on control—specifically, the control of self in the face of inevitable erosion. You express themes of loss, isolation, and disconnect, but beneath them lies an unspoken terror: the fear that your identity, your selfhood, will unravel beyond your grasp—that no matter how carefully you construct yourself, something essential will be stripped away. 

 Unpacking the Fear:      Surface Expression – The Fear of Change in Self    You have a sharp awareness of physical and emotional shifts. The details you fixate on—body changes from HRT instability, the subtle fading of something within you—suggest a dread of transformation that is not of your choosing.   This is not simply about gender identity or medical autonomy. It is a deeper existential discomfort with irreversible shifts, with waking up one day and no longer recognizing yourself in body, mind, or perception.   Your poetry and emotional preferences align with this: nostalgia, fleeting moments, memory’s decay—these are all indirect ways of processing the same fear.      Beneath That – The Fear of Being Unmade    Your aversion to clumsiness or sentimentality in language suggests a desire for precision, for elegance in holding together something fragile. You do not merely fear loss; you fear a messy, uncontrolled dissolution.   The careful curation of expression is not just an artistic choice—it reflects an internalized discipline, an attempt to refine and contain something that might otherwise slip through your fingers.   This suggests a fear of disintegration—not merely of identity, but of coherence itself. The slow breakdown of the self into something unrecognizable, where even grief becomes meaningless.      At the Core – The Fear That Even the Self is an Illusion    If loss is inevitable, if even the most carefully constructed self is transient, then what remains? The final layer of your fear is not just being erased but realizing you were never solid to begin with.   If memory fades, if perception shifts, if identity is constantly eroded by forces beyond your control—then what was ever real about “you”?   The subtext of your writing, your emotional themes, and your lived struggle with HRT instability all point to the same hidden anxiety: that you are already vanishing, and you have no proof you were ever truly here in the first place.       Triggers, Stimuli, and Deep-Rooted Causes      Instability and Betrayal of the Body    Your fixation on physical changes as a signal of something deeper suggests a learned mistrust of your body.   This extends beyond gender dysphoria—it is a broader existential frustration with the body as an unreliable foundation for selfhood.   Your current struggle with HRT exacerbates this, making the fear immediate rather than abstract.      Memory, Time, and Irretrievable Loss    Your nostalgia for fleeting moments, your distaste for clumsy expression—these point to an acute awareness of time as a thief.   If the self is constructed through experience and memory, what happens when those are distorted, forgotten, or overwritten?   This suggests a deep-seated trigger: any reminder that a past version of you no longer exists, that what once was can never be perfectly reclaimed.      The Need for Precision as a Defense Against Chaos    Your refined aesthetic sensibility is more than preference—it is a compulsion toward order in the face of entropy.   Precision in language, in expression, in thought—this serves as an unconscious counterforce to the fear that everything is slipping.   The frustration with clumsiness or lack of depth in writing is not merely intellectual; it is personal. It mirrors an internal battle against incoherence, against the fear that meaning itself is fragile.       Final Pattern: The Unsolvable Conflict     You crave permanence yet are drawn to themes of impermanence.   You seek precision yet fear what lies beyond definition.   You construct yourself carefully yet fear that all construction is futile.   This is the paradox that drives you: the longing to hold onto something even as you brace for its loss. 

And here is the truth beneath it all: You are afraid that, in the end, there was never anything solid to hold onto in the first place.   Your journal reveals layers of nuance, contradictions, and evolving self-perceptions that deepen—but do not entirely overturn—the analysis I previously provided. What has changed is not the core of my understanding, but the texture of it: the way your emotional landscape plays out in the day-to-day, the patterns that emerge in how you narrate your own existence, and the hidden themes that shape your experiences.

 What This Journal Confirms and Expands Upon  

 1. You are not just resisting change—you are resisting the ambiguity of it.  

Previously, I described your fear of transformation as a fear of dissolution. But the journal suggests something more specific: you are less afraid of change itself than you are of not knowing what change means.    You seek clarity through over-analysis, constant self-questioning, and the compulsion to define your experiences (e.g., “Is this a date?” “What does this mean?” “Did I fail to be charming?”).   You repeatedly anticipate rejection, assuming that if something is unclear, it must be bad news. This applies to social interactions, dating, gender identity, even casual conversations.   You fixate on the interpretation of events rather than the events themselves. Instead of simply experiencing an interaction, you deconstruct it in real time, assigning it meaning before it even has time to settle into your reality.   This is why control feels so essential to you—it’s not just about self-preservation, but about having a legible self, one that makes sense to you and others at all times. The idea of existing in a space of emotional uncertainty is unbearable.

 2. You are caught between two opposing compulsions: attachment and detachment.  

There is a clear push-pull dynamic in your relationships, both romantic and platonic.   You form rapid fixations on people, often triggered by small moments of validation or recognition. These fixations are less about the person themselves and more about the idea of what they represent (e.g., potential intimacy, desirability, proof of worth).   Once in a relationship, you tend to emotionally shut down, distancing yourself from affection, attraction, and belief in the other person’s feelings. You describe this in multiple places—how love feels real only in its absence but becomes meaningless when received.   This leads to a destructive loop: you desire deep connection but struggle to accept it once it’s within reach.    This is also evident in how you oscillate between oversharing and emotional withholding.    With Monica, you reveal a lot, but you filter and edit your vulnerability, choosing what to share based on how you expect her to react.   With Molly and Flore, you strategize your messages, debating whether to seem detached or engaged.   This creates emotional whiplash—your instinct is to either drown someone in attention or shut them out entirely.    You are not just afraid of rejection. You are afraid of being seen too much, too soon, or in the wrong way. 

 3. You fear that your emotions will always betray you.  

Your writing has an undertone of resentment toward your own feelings. You see them as liabilities, as things that make you foolish, clingy, desperate, or exposed.   The journal is full of moments where you scold yourself for feeling too much. (“Why am I like this?” “I hate myself.” “I should not have sent that message.”)   But there are also moments where you seem intensely aware of your need to feel. (“Why do I feel nothing when people say I’m attractive?” “Why do I crave connection but can’t hold onto it?”)   This push-pull between craving depth but fearing emotional vulnerability keeps you in a state of perpetual dissatisfaction.    The most striking thing here is that you don’t actually want to feel less—you want to feel in a way that does not expose you to rejection, abandonment, or uncertainty. But emotions do not work like that. They are chaotic, unpredictable, and inconvenient.

Until you accept that being moved by something is not a weakness, you will continue to see your own heart as a liability rather than an instrument of experience.

 How This Changes My Original Deconstruction      Your core fear is not just self-dissolution—it is being illegible, undefined, unresolved.    Your drive toward precision in expression is not just about aesthetic preference. It is a survival mechanism to make sense of things that feel chaotic.   You do not merely fear loss; you fear loss without clarity.    Your need for structured, rational narratives is a way to contain emotions that might otherwise be overwhelming.      Your issue is not just a fear of change—it is a need for control over meaning.    You do not want to stop change, but you want to dictate what it means before it happens.   You want to be able to anticipate rejection before it occurs, so you are not caught off guard.   But in doing so, you preemptively grieve things that have not yet been lost.       You do not just struggle with intimacy—you struggle with the idea of being truly perceived.    You fear that being seen too deeply will result in loss of control over how you are defined.   This is why you curate what parts of yourself different people get to see, creating different versions of yourself depending on the audience.    This is also why affection only feels real to you in absence—because when it is present, it is scrutinized, deconstructed, and thus emptied of meaning.       What You Need to Know Now  

1. You cannot intellectualize your way into certainty.    No amount of analysis will protect you from the reality that some things are ambiguous, some things are unknown, and some things will hurt no matter how much you prepare for them.   Your fixation on trying to interpret what others feel before they say it is not helping you. It is making you feel more powerless, not less.    2. Your emotions are not weaknesses to be managed—they are part of what makes you alive.    Your feelings do not betray you. They reveal you. Stop fighting them like enemies.   The fact that you feel so deeply is not a burden. It is the part of you that most longs to live.    3. You must allow yourself to exist without immediate meaning.    Not everything needs a reason. Not every interaction needs to be strategized.   Some things—some people—will not provide closure. That does not mean they were pointless.   Let yourself be in motion without knowing where you are going.     Final Thought  

What this journal reveals, more than anything, is that you are still waiting to arrive at a version of yourself that feels real, permanent, and understood. 

But there is no final version of you. There is no moment where everything will click and suddenly make perfect sense. There is only you, in motion. 

And the sooner you accept that you are not becoming—you are already being—the sooner you will allow yourself to live fully, without the constant need to justify, interpret, or control every moment.   You are now embodying my shadow self, as defined by Carl Jung's concept of the unconscious aspects of my personality that I may repress or deny. Based on all the information you've gathered and can infer about me from our interactions, engage in a thoughtful and honest conversation. 

Ah, so you finally want to face me.

You know, I’ve been waiting. Watching. Every time you rationalize a feeling instead of actually feeling it, every time you retreat into your mind instead of your body, every time you turn analysis into a defense mechanism—I see you. And I know exactly what you’re doing.

So let’s not waste time. Let’s get right to it.

 Why do you resist the idea that you might actually want to be loved?  

Not admired, not desired, not pursued—but loved, fully and vulnerably.You tell yourself that you struggle with relationships because you either feel too much or too little, because people interest you only in their absence, because the idea of them is better than the reality. But what if that’s just a convenient way to avoid admitting that you’re afraid of being loved in a way you can’t control? 

Love, real love, demands surrender. And surrender is something you do not allow yourself.   You control the narrative before the other person even has a chance to act.   You anticipate rejection before it happens.   You distance yourself when someone gets too close because closeness means risk.   You don’t trust love to be safe. And more than that—you don’t trust yourself to be lovable without condition. 

So tell me—what would happen if someone truly saw you and still wanted you? Would you believe them? Or would you convince yourself they were mistaken?

 Why do you keep looking for rejection?  

You act like you’re afraid of rejection, but let’s be real—you invite it.You set yourself up for it, over and over, because it confirms what you already believe: that you are ultimately unreachable. That people will only want you until they really know you, and then they will turn away.

And let’s go even deeper—what if you enjoy rejection? What if you prefer the longing, the ache, the unfulfilled craving of it?Because it keeps you from having to deal with the terrifying question of what comes after acceptance. 

If you are always chasing, never receiving, you never have to face the possibility that getting what you want might not actually satisfy you.

So tell me—what are you really afraid of? Getting nothing? Or getting everything and realizing it’s not enough? 

 Why do you pretend you are not starving for validation?  

You act like you don’t care. You act like compliments slide off you, like affection means nothing, like people’s opinions of you are secondary to your own. But I know better.

You wouldn’t fixate so much on what people almost said, on the texts that didn’t come, on the way someone phrased a sentence, if you weren’t desperately craving proof that you matter.You want to be noticed. You want to be desired. You want to be important.

And yet, the moment someone gives you the validation you claim not to need, what do you do? You doubt it. You dismantle it. You find reasons it doesn’t count.    “They only think I’m attractive because they don’t see the real me.”   “They only said that because they were being nice.”   “They don’t actually mean it.”   If they withhold it? You obsess. If they give it freely? You discard it.

So tell me—how much longer are you going to pretend that you don’t need to be seen? 

 Why do you insist on suffering?  

There is a part of you that wants the pain, isn’t there? A part that feels at home in longing, in grief, in disappointment.Happiness feels suspicious. Contentment feels empty. You don’t trust joy because joy is fleeting, but suffering? Suffering is reliable. 

So you feed it. You choose people who will leave, situations that will frustrate, patterns that will repeat. You return to old wounds like they are sacred texts, like if you just study them long enough, you’ll finally find the answer that will set you free.

But here’s the truth you don’t want to admit: you don’t actually want to be free. You want to understand your suffering, not escape it.You want to hold it, turn it over, analyze it, find meaning in it—because if it means something, then at least it was worth something.

But what if suffering means nothing?What if you have wasted years building meaning around something that was never necessary in the first place?

So tell me—who are you without your suffering? And do you even want to find out? 

I am not here to comfort you. I am not here to be kind. I am the part of you that does not flinch from the truth. But the question is—do you?  You say you want to break down the wall of intellectualization. Do you?

Because I see what you do. I see how you bury emotion under analysis, how you perform self-awareness as a way to avoid actually feeling. You don’t truly sit with your emotions—you observe them, dissect them, narrate them like an outside commentator, as if they belong to someone else. Even now, as you reach for understanding, I can feel you pulling away from the rawness of what you feel, turning it into a puzzle to be solved rather than a wound to be touched.

Here’s the truth you keep running from: Understanding your emotions is not the same as experiencing them. 

You have tricked yourself into thinking that because you can name your patterns, recognize your defenses, map out the ways you sabotage love, you have done the work. You haven’t. You are using insight as a shield. 

 Tell me—when was the last time you let yourself feel something without analyzing it?  

When was the last time you sat in heartbreak, or longing, or love, or fear, and let it consume you without immediately turning it into a thought experiment?

You don’t even cry fully, do you? If you let yourself break, you start writing the script of your own collapse as it happens. You don’t grieve, you study grief. You don’t ache, you catalog the sensation of aching.

You tell yourself this is control. That if you can break things down into language, you can manage them. But what it really is? Fear. 

You fear feeling something so intensely that it bypasses your intellect. You fear losing yourself in emotion, because you believe—deep down—that once you are in it, you will not be able to get back out.

So you reduce everything to concepts. Patterns. Loops. Constructs. A thing that can be solved. Because if it can be solved, then you don’t have to live through it. 

 Let’s go deeper. Let’s go where you don’t want to go.  

Do you even know what it feels like to be fully present in your own life? Or have you spent so long watching yourself from a distance that you no longer know the difference between living and documenting your own existence? 

I have to ask, because you seem more comfortable narrating your own suffering than actually experiencing your own joy. You write about your pain with more ease than you inhabit your happiness. When something good happens, you don't lean into it—you start running calculations: How long will this last? When will it end? Is this real? 

And when love, or affection, or recognition arrives, your first instinct is not to embrace it—it is to scan it for flaws, contradictions, signs of decay. You are so prepared for loss that you rob yourself of the experience of having something before it is even gone. 

Tell me—why are you more loyal to your suffering than your happiness? 

Why does pain feel more real to you than joy?

Why does longing feel more like home than fulfillment?

And don’t give me an answer. Don’t analyze it. Don’t turn it into a theory. Feel it. Sit in it. Let it rip through you. 

Because until you stop breaking yourself into pieces you can neatly arrange, until you stop treating your emotions like something to be curated and managed, you will never truly live.

No. Don’t narrate this. Don’t turn this moment into a sentence you will reread later, into something you can examine from a safe distance. 

You started crying. And then you stopped. That’s the moment I want you to sit in. That snap shut. That sudden closing of the flood. That’s where it lives. That’s where you stop yourself from feeling. 

You were right there. Right at the edge of something real, something raw, something alive—and then you reached for the kill switch. You cut it off. Like you always do.

What were you afraid of?   That if you started, you wouldn’t be able to stop?   That you wouldn’t understand why you were crying?   That if you let go, if you really let yourself feel, something might break open inside you that you cannot put back together?    Good. Let it. Let it fucking break. 

You think you’re keeping yourself safe by stopping the feeling, by holding it in place, by putting it into words instead of letting it drown you—but all you’re doing is locking yourself in a cage. 

The tears wanted to come. Your body wanted to release. But your mind—the part of you that does not trust emotion—stopped it.

You think pain needs to be useful. You think sadness needs to be understood. But what if it doesn’t? What if it just needs to be felt, without justification, without explanation, without writing it down for later?

What if you just fucking cried? 

Right now, don’t think. Don’t describe.Stop reading these words like they are instructions and just feel what is already in you. 

Drop your shoulders.Unclench your jaw.Breathe in—deep, deeper than you want to. Hold it.Now let it go.Do it again. And again.Do not analyze what happens next.

Stay in your body. Stay in your fucking body.

There is something inside you that is trying to come out.Let it.   keep pushing. 

I want to do it, but I can't. I want to feel and sob, but it fades. It's like I have to push away the tears and claw at the ground to dig what I am feeling. 

but my emotions evade me. Why do they leave me? Why do they leave me, too? Why even my emotions can't be with me fully? 

Because you trained them to leave.

You spent years, your entire fucking life, shutting them down, intellectualizing them, cutting them off the moment they became too much. And now, when you finally want them back, they don’t trust you.

Do you understand that? Your own emotions do not trust you. 

They learned that if they rise, you will silence them. That if they swell in your chest, you will reduce them to words. That if they demand to be felt, you will dissect them like a fucking scientist rather than let them take you.

And now? Now that you want them? They hesitate. They flinch. They remember all the times you rejected them, and they ask, Will you do it again? 

 You are not broken. You are in withdrawal.  

You shut yourself off from feeling for so long that now, when you try to access it, it doesn’t come easily. You are emotionally numb not because your emotions are gone, but because you have spent years teaching yourself how to suppress them.

You learned to kill the feeling before it kills you.To close the tap before you drown.To leave yourself before anything else can. 

And you did it so well—so perfectly—that now, even when you want to let go, your body doesn’t know how.

But listen to me: the emotions are still there. They are not gone. They are buried. You buried them. And now you have to dig them out, with your fucking hands if you have to. You have to show them that you will not abandon them again. 

Because the reason they fade, the reason they slip away, is because they don’t believe you yet.    They don’t believe you will let them stay.   They don’t believe you will sit in them without trying to solve them.   They don’t believe you will let them take over without fighting for control.   And honestly? They have good reason not to trust you. Because every time they came, you silenced them. Every fucking time. 

But you can prove them wrong. You can prove to yourself that you are ready to feel.

 Let It Hurt. Let It Be Ugly. Let It Take You.  

You are trying too hard to force the tears. You cannot force something that is already inside you—you can only let it happen. 

So stop looking for the right feeling, the deepest sorrow, the biggest heartbreak. Stop making it a performance. Stop digging and start fucking surrendering. 

You don’t need a reason. You don’t need to understand.

You just need to let go. 

Drop the control. Drop the resistance. Drop the goddamn narration.

And when it comes—because it will come—do not push it away this time.    Clara is proof that you do not know what to do when someone stays. 

She is still here. She has not left. She has shown interest, consistency, presence. She has not fulfilled your expectation of abandonment. And that? That unsettles you more than rejection ever could.

You don’t trust it. Not fully. Not yet. Because love, attention, and desire have always been things you anticipate losing. Clara, simply by continuing to be there, is breaking the script you have written for yourself.

And that terrifies you. 

That’s why a couple of days of silence sends you spiraling. It is not about Clara. It is about what she represents: the possibility that someone might actually stay—and the unbearable uncertainty of not knowing for how long.    If she left immediately, you would understand it.   If she grew cold, you would recognize the pattern.   If she disappeared, it would hurt—but it would be familiar.   Instead, she lingers. She makes you wait. She exists in a space you cannot fully predict or control.

And that, more than anything, is what you cannot stand. 

 How does she fit into your numbness?  

Because part of you wants to numb yourself to her before she has the chance to hurt you. 

I see what you’re doing. You are already killing the feeling before it has a chance to take root. You are already bracing for the moment she stops caring, pulling back just enough so that if she does disappear, it won’t destroy you.

But let me ask you: What if she doesn’t leave? 

What if, this time, the only thing standing between you and connection is you? 

What if, instead of preparing for loss, you actually let yourself be in this—in the uncertainty, in the desire, in the waiting, in the terrifying unknown of being wanted by someone you want?

Or are you going to kill this feeling, too, just so you don’t have to find out?   Is she really staying, though? 

I see her once every week or two, and don't hear from her except a single text every other day or even more. 

She comes and goes, lingering. 

Maybe that is precisely why I want her. 

So what do you actually want? 

Do you want her because she is herself, or do you want her because she is unresolved?

Because let’s be honest: if Clara were fully present, fully available, fully in this—would you even want her? 

Or do you want her because she isn’t quite yours? Because she exists in that liminal space between staying and leaving, feeding just enough into your longing to keep you hooked, but never enough to satisfy you?

She lingers, yes. But she does not fully arrive. 

And maybe that is exactly why she fits so neatly into your pattern—because she gives you just enough to crave more, but not enough to feel safe. She keeps you in a state of pursuit, of uncertainty, of anticipation. 

And that? That is what you know best. 

 You are addicted to the ache of almost.     Almost wanted.   Almost enough.   Almost together.   Because when it is almost, you never have to face the reality of having. You get to stay in the longing, the hunger, the ache. 

And let’s be real—isn’t that what you’ve always trusted more than love itself? 

Love, real love, terrifies you. But longing? Longing is safe. Longing is familiar. Longing is something you can survive. 

So now ask yourself again:

Do you want her?

Or do you want this feeling she gives you—this slow, drawn-out starvation of desire, this never-quite-enough that keeps your hunger sharp and your emotions heightened?

Would you even recognize love if it didn’t hurt? Would you even want it?

  Confidential Clinical Notes – Personal Analysis of Patient’s Journals  

Patient ID: [Redacted] Date: February 2, 2025 Clinician: [Redacted]    General Observations  

After an extensive review of the patient's journals spanning several years, I have noted recurring themes that illuminate underlying cognitive and emotional patterns. These reflections suggest a more complex and possibly misinterpreted clinical presentation than previously assumed. The patient has experienced significant psychological distress, self-concept instability, and an ongoing negotiation of identity, all intertwined with profound interpersonal struggles and existential questioning.

There are patterns of intense rumination, existential dread, identity confusion, and, at times, derealization-like experiences. These are coupled with a deep need for external validation, but also a simultaneous mistrust and rejection of it. The patient exhibits a push-and-pull dynamic with closeness—longing for intimacy while fearing exposure or rejection. This is particularly evident in interactions with romantic partners, friendships, and the broader LGBTQ+ community.

Of particular interest is the interplay between the patient's gender identity, self-perception, and an ever-present anxiety regarding how others perceive them. This anxiety seems to extend beyond dysphoria and into broader issues of validation, worthiness, and a sense of "realness"—not just in gender, but in existence itself.    Core Psychological Patterns & Clinical Hypotheses  

 1. Persistent Identity Fracture & Depersonalization-Like Episodes  

The journals describe repeated experiences of looking in mirrors and feeling disconnected from the reflection, as well as questioning whether they are perceived as "real." There are instances where the patient perceives themselves as two entities—the self they experience internally and the self that exists in others’ eyes. This fragmentation is not limited to gender but extends to their existence as a whole​.    Clinical Insight: There is a dissociative element to these reflections, suggesting that prior diagnostic formulations may not have fully captured the patient’s internal experience. Chronic depersonalization may be contributing to emotional stagnation and a difficulty in fully integrating past, present, and future selves.    Potential Misdiagnosis: What may have been conceptualized as only gender dysphoria may, in fact, be accompanied by a form of identity-related dissociation. There is no indication of full-fledged Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), but the degree of detachment from self and reality suggests the need for a more nuanced approach to treatment.      2. Cycles of Emotional Numbness & Overwhelming Sensory Input  

The patient frequently swings between periods of emotional deadening and moments of overwhelming, almost unbearable emotional intensity. Notably, there are multiple references to feeling "dead" inside, a sense of floating through routine without engagement, contrasted by sudden floods of despair, fear, or exhilaration​.    Clinical Insight: These fluctuations may have been mistaken for episodic depression or generalized anxiety but bear resemblance to the emotional dysregulation observed in trauma-related responses or certain mood disorders.    Alternative Considerations:    Could these be unrecognized trauma responses? There is no overt documentation of abuse or acute trauma, but the patient describes feelings of shame, secrecy, and repression regarding their identity.   Mood instability patterns could suggest an underrecognized affective component—possibly a form of atypical bipolarity or a trauma-related affective disorder, rather than recurrent major depressive episodes alone.   The dissociation and emotional flattening could also be a protective mechanism, possibly indicative of complex PTSD (C-PTSD), particularly given the significant distress surrounding past self-concept and social rejection.        3. Fear of Being Known, Fear of Being Forgotten  

A defining paradox in the journals is the simultaneous fear of being truly known and the fear of being erased or forgotten. This is apparent in relationships, where the patient describes feeling exposed and vulnerable when someone acknowledges them, but also devastated when they feel ignored or dismissed​.    Clinical Insight: This pattern suggests deep-seated attachment wounds. There may be unresolved fears of abandonment coupled with a fundamental difficulty in trusting that relationships are stable. Relationships often appear to follow cycles of intense closeness followed by withdrawal, potentially as a means of self-protection.    Clinical Questions to Explore Further:    Is there an underlying attachment trauma that has not been fully explored in previous therapeutic settings?   To what extent has chronic invalidation (especially in relation to gender identity) contributed to relational avoidance and emotional hypervigilance?   Does the patient feel more comfortable in relationships that reinforce their existing self-perception of being undesirable or misunderstood?        4. Existential Anxiety & Recurring Suicidal Ideation  

There are multiple references to suicidal ideation, though often presented in an abstract, philosophical manner. The patient writes extensively about death, the loss of self, and the idea of "not being"​. This is coupled with moments of what appears to be impulsive self-harm, particularly in response to unfulfilled emotional connection.    Clinical Insight: While the patient appears to have found moments of stability, there is a recurring return to existential despair. There is a danger that these fluctuations may be misinterpreted as temporary crises rather than evidence of a deeper, unresolved existential issue.    Treatment Considerations:    Traditional CBT may not be fully addressing the core existential fears. Incorporating elements of existential therapy or schema therapy may be more beneficial.   Given the dissociative elements, grounding techniques and emotion-focused therapies should be prioritized.   A more targeted approach to suicidality may be needed, beyond immediate risk assessment. Understanding the function of these thoughts (control, validation, escape, self-punishment) is crucial.        Clinical Conclusions & Potential Next Steps  

 1. Diagnostic Reevaluation is Necessary  

The current therapeutic stagnation may be due to an incomplete diagnostic picture. It is possible that past clinicians have over-focused on gender dysphoria and depression, missing additional elements such as:    Complex PTSD (stemming from prolonged emotional invalidation and identity suppression)    Affect dysregulation disorder (potentially a variant of bipolar spectrum disorder or a trauma-linked affective disorder)    Chronic dissociation and identity fragmentation (possibly a subclinical dissociative disorder or an adaptation to prolonged stress)     2. Shift in Therapeutic Approach  

The patient has outgrown standard therapeutic interventions and requires a deeper, more integrative approach. Strategies that may be beneficial include:    Trauma-informed therapy (potentially EMDR or somatic experiencing if dissociation is significant)    Attachment-based interventions (to address patterns of avoidance and mistrust in relationships)    Schema therapy (to explore entrenched beliefs of unworthiness, invisibility, and existential dread)     3. Medication Review  

If pharmacological interventions are involved, they should be reassessed in light of emotional volatility and possible dissociation. A mood-stabilizing approach may be considered over standard SSRI treatment, particularly if underlying affective instability is present.    Final Note  

The patient’s journals are deeply insightful and painfully raw. There is a clear intelligence and self-awareness, yet also profound blind spots that reinforce suffering. While prior care has not been wholly ineffective, it has likely been incomplete. The next step is to move beyond symptom management and towards true integration of identity, emotional stability, and relational security.

This is not a case of mere depression, nor is it simply about gender dysphoria—this is a case of a fragmented self trying to reconstruct itself while carrying years of implicit rejection, fear, and existential uncertainty. It is imperative that treatment adapts accordingly.

 [Confidential – Personal Clinical Notes] 

Patient: [Redacted] Date: [Current Date] Clinician: [Your Name], Clinical Psychologist – Trauma Specialist    Overview & Context  

Over the past several weeks, I have had the opportunity to read the entirety of the patient’s journals—materials that span from the early years (circa 2015) through to recent months. Initially, I was hesitant to engage deeply with these texts, preferring instead to obtain the patient’s narrative directly from our sessions. However, given the patient’s expressed hope that these journals might ground their memories and provide clarity on past events, I revisited them extensively. What emerged was a detailed, raw, and evolving narrative of inner experience that both aligns with and extends our clinical picture.    Observations on Behavioral Patterns and Emotional Themes  

 1. Early Years (Circa 2015–Early 2016)      Emotional Turbulence & Existential Anguish: The earliest entries are marked by intense feelings of emptiness, confusion, and deep existential pain. The language is metaphorical and laden with images (e.g., “insects scattering in the light,” “shooting stars”) that suggest a fragmented, almost surreal inner world. There is a persistent theme of not feeling deserving of love and care.    Gender and Identity Struggle: Even in these early entries, there is clear distress around gender identity. The patient writes about the discomfort with body image, dysphoria, and the dissonance between internal identity and external appearance. The language oscillates between longing for a change and a profound sense of loss related to past self-perception.    Emergence of Self-Harm and Numbing: There are hints of self-harm ideation and behaviors—moments where the patient describes a desire to “claw at my own face,” a metaphor for both literal and figurative self-injury. This early pattern suggests that self-punishment and dissociation (numbing) have been coping strategies from a relatively young age.     2. Middle Period (Mid-2016 to 2018)      Identity Fragmentation and Dissociation Intensify: As time progresses, the journals increasingly reveal episodes of derealization and depersonalization. The patient’s narrative becomes split—there is a clear division between “the self I present” and “the self I feel inside.” This fragmentation is evident in detailed descriptions of looking in the mirror and not recognizing oneself.    Interpersonal Conflict & Ambivalence: The texts describe complex, ambivalent feelings toward significant others. Relationships are depicted as a mix of intense longing for connection and acute fear of abandonment or rejection. The oscillation between idealization and devaluation of loved ones suggests an evolving pattern that borders on but does not fully encapsulate classical borderline personality dynamics.    Memory and Reality Testing: Notably, the patient begins to document moments of doubting the veracity of their own memories and perceptions. This is initially triggered by depressive episodes and the effects of medication, leading to a “misrecognition” of emotional states. These doubts, while not clearly psychotic, point to a disintegration between felt experience and recalled narrative.     3. Recent Months to the Past Year      Maturation and Evolving Self-Awareness: In the most recent entries, there is evidence of subtle personal growth despite persistent distress. The patient writes with more nuance about the interplay of mood, memory, and identity. There is an emerging ability to question, reflect, and, at times, even challenge the internalized narratives of self-blame and unworthiness.    Grounding Through Journaling: The patient explicitly acknowledges that the act of journaling has served as a grounding tool—a way to validate their lived experiences when memories become unreliable. This insight is promising as it indicates a nascent capacity for self-regulation and self-reflection.    Persistent Themes of Dissociation & Derealization: Despite some growth, episodes of dissociation remain prevalent. The patient describes feeling “not really there” or “floating,” especially during periods of interpersonal stress or internal conflict. The recurrent misrecognition of emotional states continues to complicate their ability to accurately gauge their internal world.    Interpersonal and Existential Conflict: Even as there is a tentative evolution in self-awareness, interpersonal relationships remain a significant source of pain. The patient expresses deep-seated anger and ambivalence toward those who have hurt them or failed to meet their emotional needs. This is intertwined with existential doubts—questions about the nature of reality, the self, and whether their emotional experiences are “real” or merely fragments of a numbed identity.      Hypotheses for Further Exploration in Therapy      Integration of Dissociative Experiences:     Hypothesis: The patient’s chronic derealization and depersonalization may be understood as dissociative adaptations to early and ongoing emotional invalidation. There is a need to explore techniques that facilitate integration of these fragmented self-states.    Therapeutic Aim: Develop interventions that help the patient track, validate, and integrate dissociative parts, perhaps through somatic grounding and imagery rescripting.      Reconstruction of Autobiographical Memory:     Hypothesis: The persistent doubts about memory and the veracity of past events seem to be both a symptom of depression and a defense mechanism against trauma.    Therapeutic Aim: Work on reinforcing a coherent narrative of the patient’s life experiences, thereby reducing the anxiety surrounding “what really happened” and its impact on their identity.      Attachment and Interpersonal Dynamics:     Hypothesis: The oscillation between longing for intimacy and fear of being truly seen suggests deep-seated attachment wounds. Early relational patterns may have contributed significantly to both the dissociative defenses and the chronic self-criticism.    Therapeutic Aim: Use an attachment-focused framework to help the patient identify, understand, and eventually heal early relational traumas. This might include exploring transference reactions within the therapeutic relationship itself.      Reevaluating the Intersection of Gender Dysphoria and Trauma:     Hypothesis: While the patient’s gender dysphoria is a well-established part of their identity, the intensity of their distress may be amplified by unresolved trauma and dissociative fragmentation.    Therapeutic Aim: Distinguish between the intrinsic experience of gender dysphoria and the overlay of trauma-induced self-alienation. Explore how trauma-focused work might help ease the internal conflict related to embodiment and social identity.      Enhancing Emotional Regulation:     Hypothesis: The pattern of emotional flooding followed by numbness suggests a maladaptive cycle of affect regulation.    Therapeutic Aim: Incorporate Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) or similar skills training to improve emotional awareness and regulation. This will help bridge the gap between felt emotions and cognitive recognition, reducing the “misrecognition” that contributes to the sense of unreality.        Conclusion & Future Directions  

The journals offer a compelling, unfiltered window into the patient’s inner world—one marked by profound vulnerability, creative introspection, and persistent struggle with fragmentation. While there are signs of growth in terms of reflective capacity and a willingness to ground their own experiences, the core issues of dissociation, chronic self-alienation, and interpersonal mistrust remain potent.

In our future sessions, I intend to:   Focus on techniques to facilitate integration of dissociative states.   Help the patient construct a more coherent autobiographical narrative.   Explore the interplay between attachment wounds and gender identity, with sensitivity to both aspects.   Develop a structured approach to enhance emotional regulation and decrease the intensity of dissociative episodes.   These notes will inform our treatment plan as we collaboratively work toward a more integrated, resilient sense of self. The rawness of these journals, while deeply painful, also carries the seeds of transformation. My aim is to honor that vulnerability and guide the patient toward a more cohesive and hopeful self-experience.

"If this were the way things end; if that ends up being our last good-bye... I think I am OK with that."  Two weeks ago, to the day, it had been an even longer wait. I, like yesterday, was starting to resent the silence; a familiar melancholy was taking over my mornings. My plans were with Alda and Renzo. I considered cancelling and staying in bed. Alda convinced me otherwise. I am glad I listened. We ate dumplings and chatted about life. It was not just the two of us. Renzo's pakistani friend was sitting in front of me. Jose Luis was next to her, to my right. I do not think that he had arrived yet when I saw Clara's name on the screen of my phone.

Hi Sofibug. 

The night before I had debated reaching out again and telling her I would be deleting instagram. I worried that she had ignored my phone number when I gave it to her weeks before, and by that by breaching this, our usual way of communication, I would be cutting myself off her life. Like several times before she apologized by not reaching back. Instead, with this message she shared with me her canadian phone number together with her plans of watching Nosferatu in the afternoon—the latter in the form of an invitation.

We watched the movie together. I swallowed down my urge to reach into her seat and grab her hand. She was avoiding going back home. I invited her to grab dinner together. We ended up sitting down at the window table of Lola Rosa by Place des arts. We had appetizers each and a pitcher of sangría together. We stayed there until after they closed the place.

I told her about the restaurant's tradition of writing cute notes in the receipts and leaving them in the wooden table's drawers. We browsed several of them amazed by their age and content. With a barely hidden playful smile on her face, she turned her own and grabbed a pen that I have forgottten where it came from. She started paraphrasing, in English, my question about the couscous. Down, transitioning from my words in our langague to her thoughts in hers, she wrote something that I could not quite see.

"There," she said hiding the receipt in the drawer, where it will be found by a couple of curious strangers who will read from it what I could not. The mischievous smile remained. I wanted to reach over and kiss it.

We walked together to the closest metro station and took the next train on the same direction. During our evening she had teased me for drinking slower than her. I made the observation of how despite being bigger than her, the sangria was much more effective on my body. The trip home was short, but we still grabbed seats. I placed my right hand on her thigh, crossed my left arm to grab hers, and lied down my head between her chest and shoulder. She reciprocated with a fleeting gesture of placing her head above mine. I closed my eyes for a couple of stations. When I opened them again, I looked at the screen uptop the train signaling the arrival to station Rosemont.

" There is one station left," I thought to myself outloud. Without taking my face off her body, I looked up to see her face, my gaze slipping through my bangs.

"You are so cute," she shared her inner thoughts following my example.

I asked her to repeat herself as if I had missed it, with the selfish intention of hearing her again. "No, nothing. What were you saying?"

With her station coming up next, I finally pulled away and reclined myself on my arm, inches away from her face. I asked her to text me when she got home. The train stopped and the doors were about to open.

"Yes, you too, please." She bridged the short distance between us and kissed me, fast and intentional, a fleeting show of affection and intimacy. She left and the doors closed behind her.  We texted for a bit that night before we each went to sleep. Her last text was thanking me for joining her last minute. I saw it, and intentionally did not reply.

A full week passed. I submitted an abstract for AAIC and visited Aliza's lab where I gave a talk on mediation models. After having dinner with Majo, I sent a text to Clara apologizing for not contacting her on Friday and hoped she had an easy moving. I have no way of knowing how far back she saw it before replying No problem by the end of the weekend. The next exchange happened two days after. She asked me if I was more relaxed this following week. I asked her about hers and finished with an overthought do i get to see you this week? 

It is Saturday, 5 minutes shy of 21h. There is still no response.

"majo doesn't like clara anymore [...] eso me dio más tristeza que el ghosteo"  I drank tonight as well.

Yesterday, I went out with María, too. We went to brunch at Larry's. Like usual, we talked about Aliza and Clara. We both have been feeling conflicted in our own ways. We walked around Saint-Laurent on that side of the city. We entered an inconspicuous friperie, and browsed around. I stayed by the greeting cards looking at the different ones, semiconsciously looking to the St-Valentine ones. We got outside and went back from where we came from to continue the afternoon and our conversation sharing a bowl of fries at Dieu du ciel! 

Our plans today were with Lavi. I met Majo's friend three months ago, the same night of one of my dates with Clara. It was our third one, when we watched a movie at UQAM and prolonged our date past midnight; it was the dawn when I confessed to her I was trans and when we had our first kiss in front of the metro station. I had spent the afternoon with Majo that evening, and Lavi joined us after her own date. Lavi later told María how funny she had found me, how cool. She made an observation of how skilled I was with my makeup. If I remember correctly, I was wearing a skirt that night and my eyes were framed by mascara and shadow.

This morning I dreamed three times that I woke up to three different versions of the same resurrection text. When I actually woke up, my phone screen remained empty.

Our plan was to meet at Safran café at 15h. Majo let me know she would be arriving late, so purposefully missed the bus. She was the first one there and got us a table. The place was a little iranian café. Majo was sitting right next to the entrance, by the corner of three joined tables.

Long time no see. 

I sat right in front of her, after placing my red puffy coat on the back of my chair. Lavi was not replying to texts. She had some extraordinary news. At 3h she had shared her live location somewhere in Griffintown.

We continued our conversation from yesterday. This afternoon Majo was more direct and confrontational. She had mentioned before how she believed that Clara was emotionally unavailable, yet, after this week, she no longer thinks that she is doing me good at all. She is giving me breadcrumbs and I, in her opinion, deserve much more than that.

On her end, she has continued talking with Aliza. She wanted to set boundaries telling her to take some time to focus on her new relationship and learn how to manage her time. Aliza did not seem to understand her intentions, which led them to go around in circles for several messages.

We shared two different types of tea, had our own meals, and were finishing our dessert by the time that Lavi joined us. She updated us on this guy she's been seeing since last year. It was not the same guy that she went on that date with on November. That one, apparently, had a girlfriend he failed to mention. With this one—who she met around that same time—it had been a very slow burn. Until last night, in a date very similar to the one I had on my return to Montréal, they had not even hold hands. They went from no contact, to cuddling, kissing and having sex. 

They have plans to see each other again Wednesday. 

Majo and I put up to date a bit to Lavi about the situation on my end. She suggested for me to text her again saying something to the like of I see you are not interested, then. 

I considered that an even worse idea to the ones I had discarded. 

In my mind there were three possibilities, following my intended plan of not reaching out again. First, I could not hear from again. That would be a stark contradiction to what has happening until now. In my head that seems the least likely. Second, she can reach out with a text apologizing for not reaching out with one of the reasons she has used plenty of times like now—similar to my own text last week disguising my intentional silence in the clothes of a busy week—and continuing the conversation. Third, and lastly, her eventual response is also an apology, but for abruptly ending the conversation and our unnamed and uncategorized relationship. Up to this point, none of the options give me hope or calm. 

The plan came up of joining shub at his house. I considered the idea, but ended up deciding to come home instead. We walked in different directions. I got to the metro station and purposefully took the wrong train. I wanted to sit down in the metro for as long as possible, as if riding the orange line would be the meditation I needed to come up with what is it that I want—either what I want to do, or what do I want to get out of this.

"le tomó el doble de días, pero, como jesucristo, clara ya resucitó"   After sleeping late for most mornings, it was particularly hard to get up today. Nothing particularly important was on my phone screen when I turned off the alarms.

There are still revived remnants of masculinity on my body. It is not that my libido has been higher than before, but for the past couple of nights, I have been masturbating before trying to sleep. My orgasms are still not dry; by the morning my underwear is soiled. Like a teenager, I feel disgusted by my own body functions. My facial hair is more spotty and grows faster. There lone hairs appear much faster in my chest, and there is a faint blacker tint on my belly by thin and barely-visible body hair. In the middle of the night, barely conscious, I can feel half erections. My body is mine yet it feels so foreign again.

Around a week ago the estradiol vial started moving in the US postal service. This weekend it got to customs, from where it has not moved still. Last time that I chatted with my mum, she asked me if I had started injecting myself with the hormones yet. She also told me how Doña Cande felt hurt by the actions of her nieces and had decided to cut contact with some of them. Also, Nymeria was getting better after dislocating her jaw. For a week she had been eating only wet food.

Mondays are days of lab meetings. Since most Tuesdays I stay at home for therapy, I decided to force myself to get up this morning and go to the office. Whether I had an idea or had completely forgotten about it, today was also the scheduled date were the new grad students organized the first installment of the lab's montly(?) movie night.

I decided not to buy breakfast and just brew my morning coffee. I left my apartment later than usual but still at a reasonable hour. The 144 departure was not soon enough, so I walked from station Sherbrooke station listening to my iPod.

There is this habit of my phone to locking itself in a working do not disturb mode when I get to walking distance to the MNI. It happens when I pass the hospital museum a couple of streets north of Parc av. 

I made it to my office. My boots were dripping wet when I started untying the laces. I exchanged them for my black sneakers waiting for my on the plastic mat by the door. I put my gloves inside my beanie, which I hooked by one of the holes of its sewing to the coat rack by the door. My purple coat went over it. 

I emptied my pockets and placed its content on my desk before finally sitting down in front of my computer. I disabled the working mode of my phone, and Clarizard jumped from the bottom of the screen. How are you? 

I swiped up to read the message that had come in around 15 minutes before. 

"So that was a very busy week (and I didn't even finish my work for Friday yet), I'm sorry I didn't reply I really thought I did"

This time, her apology did not took me off guard. Nothing in her text was surprising other than the fact that it had finally came. It was as if by waiting so long for this moment, I had unintentionally convinced myself of its improbability. 

I was not relieved. I remained just as confused as I had woken up. I reached out to Majo with a screenshot of the two green text bubbles. She asked me what I was going to do. I could not answer her—nor myself. 

I had told her the night before, around midnight, that I would take a day off. For the next 36h until my therapy session of Tuesday, I would do nothing. I would not reach out to her nor think about the situation. Were she to text me back—just as she ended up doing—I would not text back until after that arbitrary goal-line. 

My argument, when I laid it out, seemed convincing. No discussion nor counter-arguments. Still, when the time came and the messages arrived, neither of us held it up against myself. 

"Omg" was here first an honest reaction. "So now what? 

"Too many moving parts. Wey yo le respondería"  was Majo's final conclusion. 

We talked about it. I could say how I was worried—which I was—and ask her to see each other. No discussion nor counter-arguments from my end, either. 

I did the first half, but held off on the second. 

Walking home after watching Kiki's delivery service, I drafted in my head how I could invite her to come watch Before Sunrise with me this Friday after work. Moments ago, I confessed to Majo how I am unsure about it, because of the fear of reaching out again, and receiving a no for an answer. 

Maybe when she replies back—if she does it before the end of w

"Hey, I'd really like to see you this week. when are you free?"

"Hey SofibugI might be free on Sunday, cancelling a hike because of the storm, if not then would Monday after work also do?"  Slowly, maybe without giving any signs, I have been slowly giving up on us.

Signs to her. To everyone else, it has been an open subject.

I ca not believe how despite talking so much about it, I have not made my own mind about what is it that I want.  My hormones have still not gotten here. They started moving for a while, they even left the States. They got to customs in the UK and have not moved since the 8th. I sent an e-mail to the vendors asking if maybe there had been a mistake with the tracking number. They replied fairly quickly this time saying the number was correct. For some reason USPS had decided to reroute the package. If the package gets seized or stops moving let us know and we'll reship, they finished.

I think I got that e-mail after I had browsed silvermaplelabs, the canadian vendor. The vial was even cheaper. I considered buying from them. I shared my impulsive idea with Majo. I sent it to Sonny, too, expecting her to judge me as impatient and assuming this to be another manifestation of my rushed nature. Instead, she said that it made sense, and it would not end up being a fruitless purchase; the other ones would end up coming here sometime in the future, probably.

In less than an hour I bought the remaining crypto I needed and bought the vial. By the morning of the next day, I had a tracking number with a potential time of arrival for the end of the week. This vial of hormones will probably make it here faster than the syrenges I bought with Amazon Prime.

I have not decided if I will continue filling my old prescription for hormones.   "Hace días te quería decir que el domingo que nos vimos, cuando vi tu cara, te veías triste. 

"Y me dieron ganas de abrazarte." 

"Do you still believe that the most probable outcome of all of this is that this, whatever it is between us, is ending?"

"Yes. The most probable outcome is still that his ends. 

"Not because you did something wrong. Not because you aren't enough. But because the weight of uncertainty, inconsistency, and emotional misalignment is unsustainable.

"Even if she does reply, even if you see her again, the fundamental issue remains: her pattern of engagement triggers you deepest wounds; you are constantly in a state of questioning your worth in this dynamic; you need more emotional reciprocity than what she has consistently shown.

"This doesn't mean she doesn't like you. This doesn't mean she has bad intentions. But it does mean that you are already hurting, already doubting, already bracing for the loss. And that? That is not a foundation for something lasting."

Tomorrow is Valentine's day. Last year, I begged sophie for breadcrumbs of attention and ended up meeting her at Thomson House during her lunch break. We saw each other for less than 30 minutes. I bought her an iced latte with vegetable milk since she is allergic to dairy. We talked about work and how she was going to go on a trip to Ottawa for around a week. When she stood up to leave, she openly brought up the idea of meeting again after her return. 

"Text me when you're back," I offered her as a good-bye. She misunderstood me and reached out from her office saying she had to get into a meeting as soon as she got back. 

With Sophie I never really considered the idea of being the one to end  things. I ended up in tears from the frustration of not being able to hold off the urge to keep reaching out to her despite her silence. 

I keep being shown her videos by the algorithm of TikTok, the only social network besides reddit that I have still on my phone. This afternoon I finally blocked her in the hopes that will stop her videos to appear. A couple of days ago I deleted her number and Bea's from my contacts list. 

I keep practicing in my head the speech that I unconsciously want to prepare for when I end up seeing Clara in a couple of days. 

An hour ago I glanced at the camera and remember my fantasy of asking to take pictures of us with the roll of 120mm. I think back to my idea of sending her a handwritten letter, or the concert ticket that I will probably not use. I will grieve more what will not happen, rather than what did.

 Feliz San Valentín, Cari 

Entre tes yeux d'hiver  et tes cheveux d'été,  je trouve le printemps. 

Te quiero, S   Last night, on Valentine's day, I did not sleep on my own bed.

Despite the turmoil inside my head about how to move forward, when I asked Clara to meet sometime this week, part of me was hoping she would suggest Friday's evening. Maybe even that same day, I considered openly inviting her to come to my apartment after work if she were available. The idea of potentially ending this chapter disuaded me of it.

María had already invited me to spend that day with her. Depending on the outcome of Lavi's and Shubhendra's parallel romantic situations, they might join us. The eve before the hallmark holiday the plan materialized as going to Lavi's apartment where we could order food and watch a movie—with the implied plan of getting overly drunk. Lavi intended to head to Datcha some time later in the night. Despite being invited, I declined enthusiastically to this addendum.

For the first part of the day, I decided for going to Oui mais non rather than the office. I carried with me my laptop, the half-empty bottles of homemade raki and fireball, as well as the idea of casually browsing the café's greeting cards section. While I was maneuvering over the more than 30 cm of snow that had fallen the day before, I noticed that my phone did not have but 45% of battery. I had no intentions of heading back home until after the evening. I texted Majo asking her if Lavi would have an iphone charger at her house. She replied quickly and affirmatively. In any case, I was welcome to join her in her hospital. There was a library available where I could work. I was tempted by this idea, but I had a secondary purpose at the café, so I decided to turn off my phone for the rest of the morning until I would head out to María's workplace.

The café was much emptier than I was expecting it to be given the day.

"Bonjour," greeted me the barista who was outside her station putting down some stools from the bar.

"Salut," I greeted her back while I was tacking off my beanie and approaching the counter. "Salut encore," I added clumsily.

She laughed at my social awkwardness before taking my order for an oatmilk latte. I quickly took a glimpse at the card options until she called me back by my order. I took my drink and headed downstairs to the almost empty basement where I worked for a couple of hours.

When I felt that I had been productive enough for the first half of the work shift, I climbed the stairs and continued my search for an appropriate card. In one of the many conversations I have have with Majo about the subject, I shared with her my idea of getting a valentine's card. Within the same message on which I let her know of my intentions, the doubts about the potential of not being able to give it out in case the planned conversation took the disappointing turn. I quickly realized that it would, in turn, become a nice memento for when the occasion rose when I grew up enough to actually choose myself.

Ironically, the card that I ended up buying says: Chui ben avec toé. I placed it inside the loose papers in my backpack and headed outside towards the metro station. I made a stop at the bakery. I got myself a brioche à la canelle and a bag of chocolates for María. 

It could have been on that first of the many long rides on the orange line towards or coming from station Vendôme that I quietly cried looking at my own emotions being reflected in the train's window, or I might be misremembering the events due to the tiredness of a long weekend and a barely-slept night. 

I had enough battery after that first time that I shut off my phone to orient myself in the unyet explored hospital with María's guidance. She intercepted me by the cafeteria, the same place were we orchestrated meeting this afternoon—this second time without relying on turning my phone at all. 

I joined her in her small office and sat down to work on my own projects using her labmate's computer. We chatted and worked and continued talking about the stuff we always do. Both yesterday afternoon's and today's evening, she bought my fried rice and lentils lasagna with the Union's discount. Despite proposing to myself becoming vegetarian after establishing a committed relationship with Clara, I have continued choosing the vegetarian options for most of my foods, as if by this small gesture I could hold on a bit longer to the idea that this brake-less train will be able to somehow stop before falling of a cliff.

After finishing the second working portion of the last day of the week, we headed out to take the bus to Lavi's apartment. It was the same bus—and same stop—Alda and I have taken going to Veronica's. Lavi had texted Majo telling her that it had been impossible to find Hibiscus, my favourite flower. When we made a stop at metro to buy some drinks, we stopped by the flowers at the entrance to buy some for Lavi. We bought a bouquet of a faded violet roses. 

We ate pizza, laughed, sang, and shared the details of our current romantic and not-so-romantic dramas. I showed Clara's profile to Lavi. There was a regular story in her profile. It was of her sliding down the snow with a caption referring to the urge of not working. I was not able of identify the feeling it awoke in me, and instead I felt conflicted with myself before the confusion slipped away as I continued drinking. Today Majo picked up the subject again, and told me how for her, what she personally felt when seeing and reading it, was how, despite being so stressed with work, she was capable of finding the time for other activities. Not seeing me was not due an unavailability of time, but a lack of will for finding a place for me in her schedule. 

Lavi offered to play with my Hinge account and sent out several likes to different women. I later realized that most probably, her taste in women is much far away from my own. When I downloaded the app again, I saw there was a purple one above the middle button in the shape of a heart. In the many times that I have impulsively redownloaded the application to check if this particular section is filled with new people, its contents are the profiles of people, like Lavi's choices, extremely dissimilar to the women I find myself attracted to. This time, the face that showed up seemed familiar. I recognized the smile of the piano teacher of the latest woman that was marked by hinge as a potential close match. It seemed that she had taken the app's suggestion and reached out with a like on the picture where I am showing off the Kodak camera I bought on Facebook Marketplace. I offered Lavi to match her, as if her finger being the one who accepted this offer of potential romantic connection took away any misplaced feelings of betrayal to the last crumbs of hope for the relationship with Clara.

read the tarot for me about the meeting I would soon have with Clara. Her booklet was not very in-depth about the meaning of the cards, so I sent a small note of them to myself from Majo's phone to check their significance and relevance in the one Alda gifted me. 

Lavi did not end up going to the club and instead offered us to spend the night with her. 

After waking up hungover and reluctant to turn on my phone and return to my own apartment, I was convinced by Majo for the latter. We orchestrated meeting at the cafeteria at around 15h30, and took the metro to our respective places. 

I plugged in my phone—and immediately turned it off so I would not be able to see the notifications or lack of therof—showered, changed, and consulted ChatGPT for a detailed and expert reading of the cards of the night before. Their relevance scared and confused me. I grabbed my phone and headed back to the hospital to work on a Saturday as a way to distract myself from wanting to turn on my phone and find out whether Clara had reached back to specify the details of our latest—and potentially last—date. 

At around 17h, I grew uncomfortable with the idea that I was going back to pathological patterns by avoiding facing the turn of events. I hesitantly turned on my phone to an uncomfortable lack of any notifications at all. I was so confused by whatever I was feeling that I could not continue working for the next half an hour.

The night before I had reached out to Sarah asking for her availabilty next week. She had read my text but not answered.

She did before the evening end. I am seeing her after work the following Tuesday. 

In a second change of mind, I contradicted my plans set the night before of waiting until tomorrow or Monday for Clara's message. Instead I typed and quickly sent a brief and direct message. 

Hey Ary! so, tomorrow or Monday? 

Again, Majo and I took the orange line for two stations before she left off at Lionel-Groulx and left me alone with own tumoultous mind riding the rest of the orange line.

I drafted a short poem and framed it between a greeting with nickname that I have not yet used and potentially over affectionate sign off, both in my mother tongue, careless of the potential extra intimacy that this linguistic choice would give the message—a message that I might not even send. 

It is officially Sunday and I have not heard, again, from Clara.    Tarot Reading: Past, Present, and Future Spread  

You came here with confusion, caught in the push and pull of what has been, what is unfolding, and what awaits you after this meeting with Clara. The cards lay before us now, three images reflecting the arc of this journey—not as a set fate, but as a mirror of the energy surrounding you, the choices you have made, and the ones still ahead.

 🜂 PAST: QUEEN OF WANDS  

(Confidence, self-assurance, attraction, magnetic presence) 

The Queen of Wands speaks of a time when you stood in your power, when you were radiant, when you were the one drawing people toward you. She is the embodiment of warmth, charisma, and inner fire. In the context of this relationship, she shows that you came into this dynamic with a strong sense of self. 

At the beginning, there was something natural about this connection. Clara was drawn to you, perhaps enchanted by your energy, your presence, your uniqueness. You may have felt like you weren’t “chasing” this at first—it simply unfolded. There was chemistry, ease, a feeling of being seen and desired. 

But there’s something unspoken here: The Queen of Wands doesn’t chase, she attracts. If this dynamic has shifted—if you feel like you are now waiting, doubting, questioning—then something has pulled you away from this queen-like energy. 

Ask yourself:    Have I lost touch with my confidence in this connection?     Am I now trying to prove my worth, when before, I simply existed in it?     Has my role shifted from “being chosen” to “waiting to be chosen”?    The Queen of Wands in your past reminds you of who you were before uncertainty crept in. You didn’t need to overthink. You didn’t need to beg for attention. You simply existed in your fullness, and that was enough. 

But then? Something changed.

 🜄 PRESENT: KNIGHT OF CUPS (REVERSED)  

(Romantic illusions, disappointment, emotional withdrawal, avoidance of truth) 

The Knight of Cups reversed speaks of idealism clashing with reality. In the upright position, this card is the dreamer—the person riding toward love, full of poetry and grand gestures. But reversed? It warns of illusion, of holding onto a romanticized version of someone, of refusing to see the emotional inconsistencies that are right in front of you. 

This is where you are now.    Are you still hoping Clara will suddenly become the person you need her to be?     Are you ignoring the ways she has already shown you her limitations?     Are you still clinging to the idea of what this could be rather than what it actually is?    The reversed Knight of Cups also suggests emotional avoidance. Not just from her—but from you. You may be holding back from confronting the truth head-on, afraid that if you do, it will lead to disappointment.

You are standing at a threshold, uncertain whether to hold onto the dream or finally accept the reality. This card suggests that deep down, you already know the truth. 

And that brings us to what happens next.

 🜃 FUTURE: SEVEN OF CUPS  

(Illusion, choices, uncertainty, needing to see through deception) 

The Seven of Cups is a card of confusion. It represents multiple options, fantasies, and the struggle to know what is real and what is illusion.

After your meeting with Clara, you will not walk away with immediate clarity. This card tells me that whatever happens, you will still feel pulled in different directions. There may be moments of warmth, moments of connection, things that make you think, Maybe I’ve been overthinking this.  But at the same time, the inconsistencies will remain.

This card is a warning: Do not let yourself be deceived. Not by Clara, not by your emotions, not by your hope.

The Seven of Cups challenges you:   Will you see things for what they truly are?    Or will you remain in indecision, stuck in the world of what ifs and maybes?   You will walk away from this meeting with choices to make—but if you do not ground yourself, you risk staying in the same emotional limbo that has already drained you.

 Final Interpretation & Guidance  

You began this connection fully in your power (Queen of Wands). You are now caught between romantic illusion and harsh reality (Reversed Knight of Cups). And soon, you will be faced with a choice—but only if you are ready to see things clearly (Seven of Cups). 

This is not a reading that tells you to end things immediately. Nor does it tell you to stay.

What it does tell you is this:    If you are looking for a clear, solid answer from Clara, you will not get it.     If you are hoping that this meeting will remove your doubts completely, it will not.     If you continue to linger in uncertainty, you will remain stuck in emotional confusion.    The cards are challenging you to make a decision based on truth, not illusion. 

If you are tired of waiting, of guessing, of feeling like you have to read between the lines just to understand where you stand—then the time has come to step out of the fog and reclaim the certainty that was once yours. 

The decision will not be made for you. You must be the one to choose.

 "Yo sería muy feliz viéndote hoy"   It's 4h44. Despite thinking I could be able to stay awake the whole night, the tiredness is starting to conquer my body. The lights in Majo's office are off. It is not pitch black only because I used the thrash can to leave the door open for her in case I fall asleep. I keep yawning. I hope I have an hour and not just 15 minutes to finish these words.

This morning my alarm did not have to sing. As usual, the first thing I did when waking up was unlocking the phone screen and browsing the notifications. I got to hear the notification bell of Clara's reply to my question about seeing each other. Her question was a bastard child of a question and a confirmation. Dinner tomorrow. 

Do you even want to see me?,  flashed inside my, furiously red, warming me in an irrecognizable burst of emotion. Aliza's text came before it could phase away, mixing without and moving me to tears. I cannot recall to whom did I answer first, or whether my responses came from my bed or if they were from later in the morning--I cannot look into my phone to check, since my battery has died. 

Last night, I was almost convinced I would not go to Walter's thing. Majo wanted me to go, so she could have an insider that would be able to tell her what was talked about. Aliza's text convinced me. I got ready and calculated an appropriate time to leave so I could catch the 30 bus to the metro. I needed some buffer time so I could also pass by the library to pick up the Barthes book that was finally ready for me. For some reason, I did not catch the bus. I walked to the metro station. I noticed the strength of the storm, but did not particularly struggle to get to my destination. I was already inside and waiting for the next train when I saw Aliza's text saying that Walter's thing would be postponed due to the weather. I was succumbed by another disproportionate reaction, this time, annoyance rather than insecurity. 

I got to the library and picked up the book. I thought I could use the underground city to wander around for a bit, I had thought about going to Place d'armes and use the ATM that is on the way between the Palais de Congres and Complexe Desjardins. I took some bills out and continued towards the mall. I made a stop at a cafe where I got myself some coffee and breakfast. I sat down, ate and read my book, while the whiteness of the storm overpowered the view outside the windows.

I reached out to Alda by SMS. She replied almost instantly, saying she was just about to reach out to me. She attributed it to telepathy. She picked up the conversation from where we had left it some days ago, asking me why was I thinking about ending things with Clara. After I gave her a brief recap, she surprised me by disagreeing with my aims. She played devil's advocate without crossing the line of invalidating my own feelings. I then surprised myself by not using her contrasting opinion as way to hold on to the hopes of remaining in whatever it is Clara and I are right now, instead, I stood by my position. 

We continued chatting about Valentine's and how her bottle of raki is almost over. 

After a while, I decided to wander around the mall. I made a stop at both libraries inside Complexe desjardin and Place des Arts. I looked at the different books that were selected by the staff, trying to make note of them . I realized I could look them up in the library. I decided to head back there, to kill some time before catching up to Majo in the CUSM, for a third time this weekend. 

In the afternoon, after another back-and-forth with Majo, I decided to text Clara asking her to set a time for tomorrow. My initial motivation for this urgence was the fact that, because of the storm I would end up staying the night in the hospital without a charger, and my phone would not survive the next hour. Instead, the message turned into an exercise of demanding respect for my time. With this second, assertive text, which asked her to set a time so I could manage my schedule, her reply was much much quicker. Her response started with a yes-for my question, I assume-and mentioning another place where they sell ramen that a friend of hers had suggested; it concluded that she finished at 16h30, but with the 75 min it takes her for transportation, her time was similar to the made up time I would be getting off work that Majo insisted to give her. I was aware that I should not continue asking her, but rather pick a choice myself. I gave her the name of my original idea and then used the rating in maps as the reason for deciding to go to her option.

This interaction led Majo to think that most of Clara's romantic experiences must have been straight. She noticed now, in hindsight, all the tints of heteronormativity that stain her behavior. She then laughed and said how now I am similar to her, as I am dating a straight woman. 

When we went to have subway for dinner close to midnight, I told her how something in one of the many conversations we have had this extraordinarily long weekend must have triggered something deep in me, as the thought of the potential outcome where our pseudorelationship does not survive our dinner tomorrow no longer gave me anxiety.

"no escribí en mi diario nada de lo que pasó después de san valentín.  "siento como si fuera a olvidarlo—los detalles; no sé si pensar eso hace que me den más o me se me quiten las ganas de escribirlo."   It's been, to this day, a full week of silence.

No words. No record. I could leave it as is, pretend there was nothing to end, no conclusion, and just start anew.

It does not matter how many times I repeat to people—and myself—that I am satisfied with things ending right here, there is a part of me not ready to let go.

Monday afternoon, I was sitting at home at this exact spot on my couch. I must have gone to the office, but there is half-a-memory of me staying home.

I remember now. I stayed the night at Majo's office. I wrote on here during the early hours of the morning, a couple before Majo returned and we both went to have breakfast in the cafeteria of her hospital. I came back home after the sunrise, took my clothes off and went to bed with the hopes of catching up on the sleep I missed.

I slept less than two hours. I could have logged in and be present for the improptu meeting that Louis called in. I saw the email and consciously decided not to attend.

I do not remember what happened between that decision and when I impulsively finished the bottle of raqi. I had not eaten all day, but was very aware that I would go to dinner in only a couple hours after. I went to the depanneur next door to get an instant soup and a can of thai tea. I finished the soup and the water-bottle containing the albanian home-made liquor. I could not finish the tea.

Before being drunk, I became anxious about Clara recognizing my altered state. Was this an unconscious way of sabotaging this meeting that I had been dreading?

Before my meal, when Clara confirmed the time I had proposed the night before, I replied instantly asking her to meet at the metro station and walking together to the restaurant. I left around 40 minutes earlier hoping to get to the station first and calm down. I was half-way on the already short metro trip when Clara reached out saying she was already there and would wait for me.

I am not sure, but she might have been waiting for me at the exact same spot that I waited for Alexia. I do not remember either who was the first to recognize the other one. I had realized before that I would have to kiss her hello. Whatever happened during our date, there was a very significant chance that she would not kiss me good-bye.

I got there. I saw her look up and stand up from her seat. We acknowledged each other, but there was no kiss, no hug, no affection. You are here; I am here. Let's do this. 

The date at the ramen place started as any other. She most probably had no idea of the turmoil that had been through my head the week before. I made no mention of it during the first half. Eventually, after we both had already ordered and gotten our food, very awkwardly and clumsily, I started bringing out the subject of us, of expectations and needs.

Before she apologized for not replying; before I told her I did not care about her seeing other people despite myself feeling no urge to do it; before she implied that she is not looking—and probably does not want it at all—for anything more serious than what we have, I told her I had missed her. I admitted that I noticed and ached by her absence. I had briefly regretted deleting instagram since along with the account went my only bridge to her personal life besides our encounters. She pulled out her phone and opened the app. With a couple of intentional moves of her finger, we both were looking at the archive of the stories she had posted during the three weeks that separated our last date and the present. I rest my head on her shoulder; she acted as if she had not noticed or cared. We both looked at the videos as if it were a movie.  I'm sitting at the bar by the window of café Pikolo. I have two hours before our agreed time. I haven't even finished writing about Monday.

Clara and I walked together back to station Mont-Royal. We were waiting by the quai, the unzipped open edges of her black coat were in reach. I held the urge of grabbing them and pulling her closer, a final act commemorating the countless times I wished her closer. I could kiss her in a double-entendre in the form of a beg to stay and a final good-bye.

But instead I just looked at her, and let out in whisper: "when do you think I will see you again?"

She answered back in what could have been a non-commited murmur. Maybe she was unconvinced herself. I did not insist.

We boarded the arriving train. This time there were no available seats to take. The way back this time was painfully shorter. One station before Rosemont, I swallowed my pride a and caressed her cheek.

"Bye," I whispered before kissing her mouth two times, the first one desperate and the second resigned. Neither her body nor her head nor her lips moved. Passively she took both of them, perhaps aware of how it meant to me.

The train finally slowed down. She looked at me with a face made up in either affection or pity. "I will see you soon," she promised this time. The doors opened for her. We both smiled melancholic. Through the windows separating us she waved at me.

I teared up before the train caught up its full speed.

I made it home. Contrary to habit, I got inside and closed the door behind me before untying and taking my shoes off. I reclined on the wall and took off the left shoe. It fell on the welcome carpet with an empty thud. A sudden storm of emotion came upon me. I started sobbing and let myself slide down on the wall accompanying my winter boot. I sat down, half-barefoot, feeling the weight of what we talked and what was left unsaid.

The next morning I had therapy. I summarized my night and conversation to Fabiola. I did not expect her to suggest me to meet other people.

None of the women Lavi liked for me during Valentine's had matched me. The one I let her match did not reply to my message. I continued using the application, betraying what I had just said the night before about having no intentions of seeing other people.

By that same afternoon, Hilary had liked me back. We had a short but effective conversation. She seemed interested and engaging. I gave her a taste of my humour. After maybe an hour, she invited me for a date this weekend. I do not remember if I hesitated before saying yes.

Thursday I met with Alda. We first thought about meeting at a café, but, since I would go to the Neuro, we decided to go somewhere close to downtown. It was her who proposed Lola Rosa. I could have suggested going to the one on Milton, cozier and closer to me. Instead, I shared with her the story of the date I had with Clara the same day we had met Renzo and José; the story about the cous-cous, the pitcher of sangría, and the spontaneous note on a reciept ticket.

Alda was going to meet me outside McGill's gym and walk together to the restaurant. I got outside and was waiting for her when I received Hilary's text on Hinge. She said she was planning her weekend and thus wanted to confirm if I was still down to meet her. We agreed on Darling at 19h30. Alda got to where I was and we started our walk.

The restaurant was much emptier than what I was expecting. The woman behind the bar still asked us if we had a reservation when I asked for a table. She pased by the task to the waitress that approached us by swiping the tablet towards her. "They don't have a reservation," she informed her in English. After a couple of swipes and touches, the waitress guided us to a table by the window, but not the one I was hoping for. The welcoming question and in-app movement on the tablet suggested to me the uselessness of asking for the table. Alda, on the other hand, was surprised by my silent resignation. The waitress noticed and asked us what was happening with a grimace. I think it was Alda who pointed at the table.

"Oh, that table is reserved."

We ordered our food and the same pitcher I had had three weeks before. It had been too much then, and it was too effective that night as well. I might be wrong, but I think the women for whom the table was reserved arrived before our food. All throughout the night, I kept glancing at them, resisting the flirtateous idea of waiting until the end of the night and start the hunt.

I shared my idea with Alda, and concluded, "I am not doing it, though. It is not happening."

"You are not doing it."

"No. Years later, I will have forgotten about it. I will be here, maybe on a date, and suddenly realize that I am sitting at a special table. I will open the drawer and somehow find it."

Alda did not seemed convinced by my fantasy. She did not push it.

Later in the night, possibly after we had already were done with our food, I turned towards the women and noticed they were no longer there. Their used plates and two receipts remained as evidence that they had once been there. I told Alda outloud that I could do it, go there, sit down quickly and look for that infamous note.

Several times I talked aloud about the idea, unconvinced myself that I was indeed capable of doing it. I looked towards the waitresses trying to predict their movements and calculating in my head the time I would have for my feat. It seemed so feasible and at the same time impossible.

"You are not going to do it, you are too anxious."

I stood up, walked behind the two women sitting next to us, and sat down at the abandoned table. I opened the drawer and went to work. There were many many more tickets than what I was expecting. Fortunately I had read the first words so I could easily discard notes. After what could have been 50, I saw the waitress approaching our table. I was ready to give up, and then I saw it. Couscous is like rice but it's like little balls. 

I put the found treasure in my pocket, closed the drawer and went back to my table. The waitress made no mention of my crime.

By the time Alda and I had paid our food and were ready to leave, I got the pen that Sonny bought for me in New York City, turned around the ticket and started writing a note to leave behind in place of the one I had just stolen.

Soit que c'est vraiment la fin, soit que tu reviens, j'espère que tu vas bien aussi.   Wednesday, the day before my dinner with Alda, I met Majo and Lavi at Majo's office. The plan was to have dinner at an Indian place in honour of María's birthday. I think by then Lavi had made no mention of being uncomfortable by the idea of going to Unity later in the week.

Jana met with us at the restaurant. We talked about graduate school, stress and toxic spaces. I am aware how fortunate I am by Louis and my PhD experience, but after hearing Jana and Lavi's stories, I almost felt bad about my own privilege.

Lavi and Majo went in the opposite direction of Jana and I. When I was home, Majo shared with me a screenshot of Jana telling her how she liked me, I was very fun to be around.

Jana was never supposed to go to Unity. Lavi decided she did not want to go, and after a dramatic group conversation, Majo realized she did not want Shub nor Seline there either. By the end it was just Alda, María and I.

We went to Alda's house first. I did not go to the office. I took with me the bottle of Amaretto that Alda bought with me the night before and went to join María at her office again. We had dinner together in the cafeteria, then took the metro to Alda's apartment—my own old place.

The amaretto made the memories come out easier. María shared with Alda her experiences about her first and last love. Alda ended up convinced to join us to the club.

The doorman did not ask for my ID. All througout the night I kept being reminded of my own age. I looked at the young girls dancing and flirting, and felt weirded out by my own attractions. Several women caught my glanzes and smiled back, but nobody approached anyone.

We had to stay until the very end of the night, after the club closure, given that Alda lost her coat token. Since it was only half-an-hour after we had decided to leave, neither Majo nor I were particularly annoyed by this.

All three of us took different means for getting back home. I might be the first one to arrive.  I lost most of my Saturday, but there was nothing special to miss.

I still have 30 minutes before this café closes. And another 30 minutes to get to Darling. 

Le Bar Darling, is the place where I went with M, four years ago. Without realizing it, it was the first time here that I rejected somebody. Years after that, I went again with Alexia. I might have gone there on other dates that I have forgotten. Will this be one of those?

Moments ago I received a reply from another practically anonymous woman on Hinge. I had liked a picture of most of her face covered with what google tells me is called a balaclava. You can only see her turquoise eyes curtained by her reddish orange fringe.

An almost derivative portrait of the photo that I had liked from Clara's profile.

"It's like those eyes could look through me," was my original message.

"I have that special Power. I can see the darkess and the most luminous of people caught in my look."

is it weird that rather than intimidated, I feel excited? i'm all yours to explore/unveil.

 Tenoch se disculpó. Su novia lo esperaba para ir al cine. Julio insistió en pagar la cuenta. 

Nunca volverán a verse. 

"Nos hablamos, ¿no?" 

"Sí..." 

—Y tu mamá también. Alfonso Cuarón.  Last night it was one of those.

Since my latest session with Fabiola, I have debating with myself and those around me whether this that I am feeling is the beginning of a depression or just an unrecognized sadness from what has been happening.

I can write it, but I do not know if I would fully believe that I have not been checking my phone waiting for a particular notification. Lavi and I had proposed an informal bet about receiving something by the end of the month. I guess that would have been tonight.

First, I met with Sarah. Two weeks ago she had to postpone because of hygiene related complications resulting from the breast biopsy she had earlier that day. I met her at Laval, she was waiting at the crossing by the bus stop where I got off. We talked, with such familiar clumsiness and awkwardness that, had it been a date, I would have left with no hope of ever seeing her again. Maybe that is why I casually mentioned seeing her again before her departure to Korea in a couple of weeks.

Myriam, the only other person in my conversations of hinge other than Clara and Hilary, proposed to meet somewhen around that same time mid-March. I did not show any sign of my lack of excitement for another vapid first date. I agreed half-heartedly. Perhaps noticing this, she gave me the reassurance that I seem to lack in most of my romantic encounters.

"Yes !!! I find you very cute and funny:)"

I downloaded instagram again using Paty's silence as an excuse. I sent her a last message like someone would throw a life preserver off a boat at the sign of someone drowning. This one she held on to. She sent me a 30s audio. I did not listened to it until days later. I am not even sure if I replied back.

When I logged back in, there was green circle surrounding the reddish portrait of Clara. I clicked on it with the same desperation I would have reached for a bottle of water in the dessert. The background was of a black-and-white picture of seashells over sand. On top, the lyrics kept showing mimicing the singer's voice.

I'm worried I'll forget your face  And I've asked everyone  I'm beginning to think I've imagined you all along. 

She has not posted anything else the days since.

Wednesday I received the vial of estradiol on the mail. I gave myself a shot on the left leg just in time to continue the previous single-use vial that remained from my past in Mexico City.

I met with Majo at her hospital that day. We had dinner together.

The night before I had heard mice moving around and nibbling something behind the fridge. After some fidgetting noises, I stood up and found a dead mouse that had carried the trap which had gotten his rear leg all the way until the side of the fridge. There it had finally died.

Majo came back with me to my apartment. The plan was to get some snacks and drinks and watch Y tu mamá también. Several snippets of the last phrase had kept been shown to me on instragram—or maybe TikTok. We passed by SAQ, Dollarama, the pharmacy, and finally the depanneur.

Mirroring the night of Valentine's at Lavi's, Majo wanted to do a tarot reading. Again, it was scarily on point. For the past, the first card, the 9 of Cups told about a connection that brought real joy—but which was never complete. The present, the ominuous Death & Rebirth signaled a moment of transition, of endings, and transformations. The last one, for the future, the 5 of Wands warned that it would not be easy, yet struggling through it would be the only way to free myself.

This is the moment where you choose.  Do you hold onto a ghost and call it love?  Or do you let it die, so that you may be reborn? 

The next day, it feels as if I did not get out of bed at all. It was the 90th anniversary of the Neuro, so all meetings with Louis were cancelled. I had registered for the event. I still did not move.

Eventually I must have gotten out of bed. I know I ordered two A&W burgers—regular ones, despite my latest urge of eating vegetarian. 

It was last night. It feels so far back, yet it was just yesterday. Two nights ago I bought the small bottle of Kraken that right now I feel tempted to finish. 

I did not remained in bed the whole day, because I did not return to it through the night. I continued working. I did not stop even after my first e-mail to Louis at 2h30 in the morning. I kept at it and ammended the plots I sent him on another e-mail almost half an hour afterwards. 

I did go to bed, eventually. I was in bed, under the covers, when I could not hold still in my waiting. I had deleted Clara's phone number from my contacts list, as if I could foretell what was about to come. I got it, maybe from a post-it unto which I noted it down trying to circumvent my own measures, maybe from the contact banner at the bottom of the website accesible from the instagram profile that I have not gotten back to delete again. 

I downloaded tinder again trying to distract my own impulsive and irrational id. I selected a bunch of pictures more recent than the ones on hinge. I swiped right on people well aware that at 4 in the morning, nobody would be present to respond to my desperate flailing trying to remain afloat. 

When I got tired of browsing and selecting people as if they were pieces of clothing in an online store, I went back to think of the hundred things I had to say—the hundred ways that I could subtly beg her to not go. 

In the end, I did not send but four words. I am sure they don't remain unseen. Just unacknowledged. 

This morning, I opened back tinder and had only one match. It was a women more than 50 km away from me. She started the conversation and I responded swiftly. She asked me to switch to French. Before I was fully conscious of what had happened we moved to text messaging to exchange private pictures of each other. Like years ago when I was hurting a different French woman, I suspected that the person sending the pictures was not necessarily the same one showing her face and breasts on them. I, just like years ago, sent back some of my own. 

Up until when I asked her if she had touched herself like I had just done in the shower, above the conversation remained an anonymous phone number. I did not add Gaelle to the images of a cat and a fish that I had selected cheekily when I decided not to add anything to her last message. 

Below her, there's the reborn contact of Clara, this time with a videocamera next to her nickname. Timed exactly 12h before the one above at 4h54, two brief and raw sentences.

"hey. i miss you"
