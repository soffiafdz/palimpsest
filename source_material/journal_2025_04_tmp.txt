 "Detesto cuando mi mamá, o Sonny, o quien sea, me pregunta: ¿sí te tomaste las pastillas? He estado haciendo todo bien. Por primera vez estoy haciendo todo bien.

"Estoy harta."   I stood up from the couch and went into my dark bedroom to get the last two pills. It's not 22h yet, but I am betting that I will be just fine.

I cannot remember how long it took me yesterday to fall asleep. Whatever much it was, the real struggle was in the morning. I must have put an alarm—why has it been so hard to remember the act of putting or not an alarm?—but I did not get up until 30 or 20 minutes before our scheduled appointment.

I remember now. It was late. Midnight had already passed me by when I swallowed my second-to-last portion of tiredness in a bottle.

I was occupied with the task of taking notes. After finishing the last entry of March, I went back on the records of last week to contrast my memories against the records I have been taking. On the small yellow legal pad, in black ink, I made brief annotations of the key events that had happened in the past 10 days. Going to the library, crying on the walk home; detours to buy a small bottle of whisky, of vodka; the day that I had planned, or cancelled, to see someone; when was it that I got those unexpected texts that brought me back to where I had started. I filled two pages. I had enough to talk about.

Puedo usar esta sesión para hablar solamente de Clara.

I considered ending yesterday's entry what that rehearsed way I could open the session. I felt overwhelmed by her that 50 minutes seemed like they wouldn't be enough.

Yet, the morning came, and my drowsiness, just like the hundred questions that evaporated as I reached for them, I could barely remember what was had been so essential that I deemed of urgent importance about the French woman that I wanted to talk about.

I used the half-an-hour I had to wet my hair and brew coffee. With my wet t-shirt and the tall glass of iced coffee, I sat down in front of the computer and sent an email to Louis before I could log in to Fabiola's Zoom Meeting Room.

"It pains me to say it, but I think the best will be to postpone the seminar to May."

Except that it is not the truth at all. I sent it 15 minutes after my session had ended.

With Fabiola I shared my frustration with my memory. Past days intertwine with each other, knotting into a giant mess. Last night I shared with my mum my task of setting order into what had happened. She mentioned the night before I had gone to the library. I did not remember how I had to pull myself from bed and pick the less dirty items from the mat of moss that has been spreading next to my window. I did not shower, I did not brush my teeth. I cannot say how long I remained there, just that I finished and returned the book.

One by one, I went through the days—even some before our last session. I started by saying that in my head it was hard to imagine anyone in general but her specifically remembering what has happened in my life. How could she remember the events that we've talked about it, if not even I who lived through them can recall them?

I got to the day when I received Clara's text in the middle of my sobbing on the metro. She made the observation that they destabilized me. To be fair, I do not know if I could call stable the past few days before their arrival.

I talked about my confusion with whatever it is that is happening now. Part of me finds it unbelievable that there remains in her the least bit of attraction towards me. Yet again she came back, not only to explain, justify or apologize. I hope you are okay and that we can see each other soon. I narrated briefly our meeting, emphazising what it was not. It was not this cathartic and dramatic event; it was not this sweet and affective reunion. We saw each other, we talked, we said good-bye.

I explained to Fabiola why I do not want to be friends with her. All my life, the closest person in my life has been the one I fuck. The only other being who can see me bare, is the one who regularly saw me naked. Since my arrival in Canada, as I started getting closer to Alda, I realized the importance of the love and affection, the intimacy and care, that can exist in relationships without sexual desire.

After my session ended, I showered and left towards Café Aunja. Alda joined me not much after. We spent the evening chatting inside the café, walking downtown, and hunting for a pair of slippers inside the mall.

Chatting with my mum, she asked about Majo. When was it the last time that I had seen her. I shared this curious fact with her.

"Le dijiste que te dije que nos viéramos el sábado pero decidiste ver a Clara?"

Of course I wouldn't. "mi mamá no sabe de la existencia de clara" I told her so.

She was surprised of this.

Why? I told Alda, and she got my point.

As we walked Sainte-Catherine, we both wondered. I do not tell my mom about the girls I date. It makes it feel more real. Then, I would have to tell her whenever it ends.

"Mi mamá sabe de las personas que me han importado"Pero si es cierto que la relación que tengo con mi mamá es muy cercana."

does your mom know about me?, I added as question 30 to the list of remaining hundred questions that I did not think to ask.

### Wednesday, April 2nd, 2025

 I was the biggest fan of your way of saying good-bye. I do not know what I miss, that or Sofibug. (This is not a question.)   It was around midnight as I was lying in bed, replying to Sonny's messages and going back to the notes app to jot down a new questions that I had just thought about. I got to one or two over fifty, when I heard the coarse buzz thunder with me in the room. Like a cat, I bristled opening my eyes widely and resting immobile. A stranger forgetting their keys and trying out random apartments for anyone awake crossed my mind. I remained hidden under the covers and the darkness, hoping that with time whoever was outside would leave.

Then, the first knock on my door pulled me up to my feet. I thought about using my phone as a lamp, but did not want the light to creep beneath the doorframe tattleing my presence.

Whoever it was, they knocked again.

On the bells of my feet, I crept to the door. I tried to look out the peephole, unsure of what I was expecting to greet me on the other side. I stood up right behind it and went to see, as I would approach the viewfinder of my camera right before taking a picture.

Nothing, except an orange shadow. I thought of someone covering up with a piece of plastic or a notebook. I stepped back, stumped.

They knocked again.

I felt the impulse to try again, as if the outcome would be somehow different. Instead, I stepped back.

My anxious mind came up with the scenario of someone expecting me to see through the peephole pointing a gun where my head would be. This time, I took three steps further back.

The phone that was still in my hand started vibrating. Majo's name next to a cup of coffee lighted up above the slider to take the call.

Why would she be on my door. I tried to think what alarming behaviour I could have done in the past hours. I reviewed my day in my head as the phone continued ringing. I cut off the thought by taking the call.

I do not remember if any of us said something, before I hung up. She must have asked me to open the door.

When I did, it was just not her on the other side. There were two people standing there waiting for me to recieve them. It took my tired mind a couple of seconds to recognize Sonny standing in front of me.

I let them in.

María sat on my couch. Sonny chose one of the little stools under the table where they put Sonny's backpack. Majo's backpack was next to the door, by my boots. They placed a couple of bags next to where Majo was seating.

I was still confused when they ask for me sit down. Estás en tu casa.

The first questions that came to my mind were How?, How much did it cost?, Who paid for it?

Sonny's answers were avoidant and vague. I did not push.

We talked about my therapy earlier that day. I passed the small legal notepad to Sonny, after I mentioned my need to look back in my diary and make notes of what had happened the previous ten days. The topic of conversation, like a river, naturally streamed until it settled on Clara and the concert next Wednesday.

"¿No ha escrito?" asked Majo. I suspected her already knowing the answer and placing the question as a way to prove a point. Did I feel irritated by it?

No; of course not. But I am not expecting her to.

I continued talking about how I had decided not to reach out to her for the rest of the week. I wanted her to be the one to bring up the concert again and lay down the foundation of our plans for that night. When I had that conversation with Alda, she said how, if it were her, she would not text until the very same day.

"...and if she doesn't, then I will go on my own or just won't, at all."

None of them—of us—believed me.

Not much later Majo got herself an Uber home. Sonny and I went to bed.

Waking up today was almost as hard as last morning. I had enough time to shower this time and brew coffee for the both of us.

I sat down in front of the computer ready for the call. Sonny decided to stand besides me until the moment that the purple square at the bottom right of my screen appeared with Dr Franck's name.

He asked me how I have been.

I found my usual spot somewhere between lying and telling the complete truth. I mentioned the unpredictability of the effect of the sleeping pills. I mentioned the first nights that I took them as a way to, early and defeatedly, give up on the day, and how they worked marvelously. But then, other times, just like the night before, I would take them and not feel their effects until a couple of hours afterwards.

He instructed me to take them early, a couple of hours as opposed than the 30 minutes the pharmacist had suggested me before bed. He then asked me about how I had been adjusted to the new dose of quetiapine. I did not mention my suspicions of being in a mixed episode. He took my deceiving answer and offered how he was uncomfortable with the idea of increasing further their dose.

We scheduled the next meeting in two weeks.

Sonny asked to go to L'oufrier. I thought it would be useful for me to pass by la bounderette and make use of their change machine. We ended up going to le toasteur instead.

Majo and I kept our plans for dinner tonight. Right now Sonny is sitting beside me in the library. We have around 15 minutes before we have to leave to meet with her at Complexe Desjardins and head together to Lola Rosa.

### Thursday, April 3rd, 2025

"can u buy me a chocolate if i don't text clara until the concert?"  I did not set an alarm. We remain in bed until well past noon. I kept waking up and falling back to sleep since the sun rose. I cannot say what kept me in. I was not under the sedative effects of my medication, nor tired from a busy day before.

I grabbed my phone and looked for emails addressed to me. I put the phone somewhere besides me and went back to unconsciousness.

I felt the pressure of the morning ending outside the covers. With it, an overwhelming sadness came upon me and took over me. With its possession, my respiration became agitated and I started crying. Quiet whimpers became uncontained sobbing. Sonny heard me nad placed her hand on my back. I do not know if her intention was to calm me or just remind me of her presence.

I do not remember either for how long I cried.

I took a final turn before getting myself out of the bed and the room. I walked to the restroom and sat on the toilet. Drops fell from my face unto the floor like the first handful of raindrops that announce the coming rain. I thought about the box of razorblades that are somewhere in Majo's apartment, kept safely away from me to keep me safe. I thought back to the last time I misused them, slashing my thighs and the sweet release that came afterward, like physical and emotional sigh of relief.

I put my hands over my thighs, below where the scars have not yet completely faded into bad memories. My sadness and self-pity turned into muted anger. I raised first the right hand and swiftly hit myself on the thigh below. A soft scream spread under the skin throughout the muscle. The left hand echoed the desperate gesture. This time, the pain remained a bit longer. I waited expecting a purple trace to remain behind my self-abuse.

I flushed the toilet, washed my hands, and came outside. Sonny did not hear what happened or, if she did, she made no comment about it.

There was a message in my phone from Aliza asking how my meeting had been with Louis. There were no emails from him asking how I have been doing or what he can do to help. I drafted a message in Teams, confessing today was one of the bad days and asking him to postpone our meeting. I did not send it and, in the end, it was unnecesary.

Earlier that morning he sent an email telling us he is going away on vacations from the 11th to the 18th. Another email chain started by Daniel talked about next Monday's meeting to talk about Vlad's findings in ADPD. In the afternoon, when me met Aliza at the café in Verdun, she made an offhand comment about how both Amelie and Olivier were granted oral talks for it. I thought back to the email after I changed my registration to offline, whoever was on the other end deemed of utmost importance to correct my comment by saying that they did not give me a talk, but rather On-Demand. I most probably will skip Monday's meeting.

Last night, when I was in bed trying to fall asleep, a couple of minutes before Sonny's soccer related stream, I got a couple of text messages from Sarah. They were letting me know of their returned from their trip and offhandedly excused themselves by a subtle sharing of their work schedule the past week and bookend weekends.

I picked some clothes from my closet and went to shower some time after 14h. I came out to my bedroom and sat on my bed with the phone in my hands. I have no memory of it, but it was probably then when I replied back to Sarah. Sonny came to the doorframe and asked me if there was enough time for her own shower. I answered affirmatively, despite we would probably be late. I had not told Aliza about her surprise arrival yet.

While Sonny showered, I opened up Hinge and saw that there was nothing new yet again. Nothing new has been on there in the past weeks. I thought about the countless profiles I had liked without any response back. A couple weeks ago, I opened up my profile to all the world and received the expected although unwanted attention from the straight male population. I opened up Clara's profile a last time and quickly looked through the first set of pictures I knew her from before meeting her in person.

I went through the options and marked yes through the confirmations that led to the deletion of my account. I downloaded tinder and did the same procedure.

We left the house and ended up arriving at the café only a handful of minutes before our agreed time. We chatted in the café. Talked about life. Gave missing updates of our respective lives. We planned to go tomorrow to La Banquise for dinner. Aliza asked me if I wanted her to invite Majo. I am not sure if she meant it as an offering or as her asking my permission. Although at first she said she would go, later Majo updated us that she had a patient.

After the café, we all went to Falafel Yoni. Although only Sonny and I had early dinner, Aliza kept us company.

Yesterday, I disassembled again the olympus and gave it a last try to the effort of repairing it. I put it back together and fully gave up on the idea. I let the impulse of buying another one remain dancing in my head. When we got home, I bought another half-35 camera from ebay. This time, it was a mint canon demi ee17.

Out of nowhere, it crossed my mind to let Clara know about this latest purchase. I put away the thought without completely discarding it, just like yesterday when I put the recently reassembled half-frame back on the shelf.

### Friday, April 4th, 2025

 Pero tú invadido por la calma y yo con un ansia ciega te bajo la mirada   Porque estando tan cerca es muy probable que descubras que aunque no quiera me vuelas.   These days it should be easier to write these words. I was eager for Friday, together with Sonny, to come. I hoped that having her here and filling out my schedule with plans and outings would help me get distracted from the turmoil inside me that I cannot get rid of.

Last night, we returned from seeing Aliza and just stayed home. I had the tupperware with half-a-week old rice and lentils stew for dinner. Sonny reheated the half of pita she kept and the leftovers from her breakfast poutine. I followed Dr Franck's guidance and took my pills early at night, sometime between 21-22h.

I was supposed to pick up the rest of my medication. I was still in bed when the pharmacist called to inform me that they had received the missing medication from my prescription. I confirmed that I could pass by anytime. After she said yes, I hung up and went back to slumber.

Was it yesterday when I woke up in sobs and tried to hide away in the restroom from my self-punishing impulses? The memory feels both so distant and close at the same time. This morning when I sat on the toilet for my morning pee, I caressed the sore spots on my thighs looking for bruises. They are there yet almost imperceptible, like a camouflaged insect hidden by a garden.

I should have sent an email to Louis. I should have at least tried to log in to the ADPD online portal to check if anyone has passed by or visited my virtual stand. I have no idea what will happen with the expense report.

I asked Sonny to try to get up earlier today. She actually went to bed earlier than I did. I remember now, both of us sitting on the couch. We spent a significant amount of time browsing the selection of movies trying to pick one I could barely pay attention to. As the night kept creeping on us, I gave up on our task and let her choose whatever she wanted. She picked the first movie of Emily Stone career. I continued writing my words. Around 30-45 minutes into the movie,  she decided it was time for her to go to bed. I said it was not necessary to leave the movie playing. I am not sure how, but it was certainly not long before I finished myself and joined her.

We were lying under the covers and watching the curated material the algorithms of TikTok and Instagram had prepared just for me. I thought back to one night around maybe three years ago, when I did the same thing with Héloise, except it was hers. I cannot recall if that moment was the morning after or the night preceding she slept with me. I do not feel like recounting the chaotic and uncomfortable day afterwards neither Alda nor I knew how to get rid of her.

I thought about the frustration of the lack of effect from my sleeping pills before I fell asleep well past midnight. As expected, getting up in the morning was particularly difficult. This time, though, I did rise before the three hands of the clock met at the top.

After all, today has been a productive day. I brewed coffee for the both of us. Despite Sonny offering to prepare it, I did not want breakfast. I went downstairs and set the first load of laundry that we could not do the afternoon before; someone had left the maching unattended after starting it, and their wet garments kept it unusable. Had I been just a bit more irritable, I would have put my hands in there and taken them out to place them moist and wrinkled atop the drier machine.

Half-an-hour afterwards, we went back and moved everything to the drier machine. We set the second load. I showered and put on some clothes. I do not think I have worn both this white-and-gray striped top and these pair of levi's in the whole third of the year that has passed.

For our first trip outside, we passed by Baristello and bought coffee beans for the following week, we went to Tsikinis to get the fruits and vegetables necessary for the vegetarian lentils bolognese sauce that Majo recommended us. We came back to leave our stuff and then went back outside. For our second trip, we went only to IGA, to buy the rest of the shopping list that I tasked Sonny to prepare. In this, our third and final time outside, we went first to la boulangerie when I got myself a pastry for late lunch. On the other end of the block, I went to the pharmacy to pick up the remaining portion of my sleeping medication. The women at the counter smiled in recognition before I got halfway through explaining to her my reason to be there. I paused, but she continued looking at me, inviting me to finish. Fernandez, c'est ça ?

We continued walking south towards Parc Jarry and came here to Ouis mais non. Rather than coffee or tea, we are drinking lemonades on their basement. In one hour we're leaving to meet with Aliza at La Banquise.

 Vu á l'instant

En train d'écrire   The sauce is simmering. One of the recipes called for 30 minutes. I proposed one or two hours. Sonny said 15-20 minutes would be enough.

The timer I set up on the microwave is about to burst. Five seconds. There it is.

Once again, I lost almost the full morning. We put an alarm at 10h30. I disabled it as soon as it started singing without even turning to Sonny. The day kept distancing away from us.

I stood up from the couch. I asked Sonny again to wash the dishes. We decided to let the sauce simmer a bit longer. I went to my dimmed room and took my pills even though is not even 19h. I am ready to finish the day. I do not even want to eat anything.

I just remembered how the reason that I paused my writing was to get my bottle of water.

When I got up from the bed less than an hour before noon, I asked Sonny if she could make me breakfast. I had in mind brewing coffee for the both of us in exchange. I served both of our cups and she put a couple of eggs to fry on a pan. I heated the leftover tupperware with beans and started to heat a second pan to for a couple of tortillas. My breakfast was simple but effective. It was not delicious—or even satisfying—but it killed my hunger for the rest of the day.

Sonny and I watched Anora. I had a significant headstart from the couple of times that I tried to watch it the past week. During this time, I tried to reserve the tickets for our plan to visit the museum. Majo brought up how the first Sunday of the month the entrance is free. I first tried to fill up the form on my phone, but when it continued getting stuck I reached for my iPad. It was also fruitless. I felt the precise point where my frustration started morphing into blind rage. I was quick enough to hold up the urge of throwing away the gadget into the floor. I was satisfied with imagining it crashing into the fake wood and multiplying into several smaller pieces. Later I asked Sonny if she would mind going to the museum with Majo alone, and I could join them afterwards. A couple of minutes ago, I sent the same question to María.

I continued the chat with Sarah. Weeks ago, maybe even a month, when we were planning our last meeting, I debated with myself the thought of talking about Clara with her. Majo mentioned, that as a friend, she would feel sad and left-out if she knew I was keeping things from her. I still ended up not bringing it up at the restaurant.

"it's been very practical these weeks, i can pick and choose what to complain about, world issues, work issues, bipolar/sleeping issues, dating issues," I sent, laying out the subtle hook.

"Omg such a blessing," she approached it. "Please spill the dating issues if you want to!" She bit. I sent her a summary of the 4-5 month situationship, and what has happened since last year.

"One week is crazy!!" I cannot say why, but I did not feel justified or validated.

She brought up getting coffee so I could give her the full story. Her last message tells me that she would check her schedule as soon as she gets home. This means she was replying to me from work.

I cannot say if the movie had already ended when I saw Cinema Moderne's post about the remastered Princess Mononoke showing. I cannot recal either if the pause and hesitation was significant before I used instagram's built-in share function to send it to Clara.

"Le acabo de mandar mensaje a Clara," I confessed to Sonny sitting next to me. She said nothing.

"Le sigues escribiendo y te deja en visto," Majo was not as forgiving. "Nos sorprende? No, no nos sorprende."

I kept opening the conversation here and then. I do not think I was testing chance trying to catch the mark of seen as close to its birth as possible. Still, I did manage to get in just as it changed. The seen right now faded away, first, in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it quickness, into a notification of a reaction, and then into a warning that the user was writing something. It flickered between these two stages for around a minute.

yes my flatmate, was the only thing I could steal a glimpse from outside the conversation. Since I have disabled the notifications from instagram, I could not do what Majo argued she had done of peering preemptively at the complete message from the notification.

I swallowed and clicked on the conversation.

"yes my flatmate showed me that! One great news, and in 4K must be something to see" This time the hook was seen but ignored.

Did she see right through me? Is that why she hesitated before sending? I doubt she gives half the thought I do to replying to me.

"i still haven't seen it. 4k in a theatre would probably be a good first time"

For some reason, I went with dangling my implied invitation. I ignore how conscious of it I was, but I surely must have realized that this was not a good move. I imagined her seeing the notification. She would maybe sigh in disbelief and roll her eyes before dismissing it.

I don’t know if it was the anticipation of this reaction—one I had neither evidence for nor reason to expect—that pushed me to send another message.

"i'm considering going, i definitely would if you wanted to see it with me"

I hesitated to go into the conversation a couple of minutes ago when I wanted to double-check what I had replied to her exactly. I took a screenshot of her text and my two responses—the one I sent to Majo, intentionally left out the latter. For this last sentence, I used this screenshot rather than opening instagram again and seeing if she had opened, read the messages, and maybe even reject them.

### Monday, April 7th, 2025

It is my own faultfor being stubborn, insistingwhere I'm not welcome.  Sonny is sitting besides me. I asked her if she did not mind that I work on this while we watch The Last of Us. I asked her to watch it together before the premiere of the second season next Sunday. I opened the website and she saw the blank square before today's. She asked me if I hadn't done them last night. I said back that I could not remember why. Because you went to bed at 18h.

I cannot remember most part of yesterday. I took my pills and gave up on the day. We did not go outside. I just asked Sonny if we cooked the lentils bolognese sauve yesterday or the day before. She said it was two days ago. I have no choice but to trust her.

I am waiting still, anxious, for a text that might never come.

I went to bed, but I did not sleep at first. Practically, there was no difference, the evening still went on without me. I intentionally left my phone on the living room when I took my pills to take me away. I exchanged my a couple hours of consciosness for borrowed calmness.

If I did not sleep, whatever it was that kept me busy the first half of the night ended around midnight. The lights outside the room were on. This time, since I opened my eyes, I already suspected I was home alone.

This is one of those times when I cannot trust what I remember. A conflicting memory says I did not get out of bed until I heard the buzzer. Sonny has a spare key, but just like the one I had to exchange Majo, they lack the experience that I've gotten knowing precisely how to make it dance just right in order to gain passage. I got up to the entrance. I grabbed the phone by the entrance and put it to my ear. With the broken button on the machine at the other end of the wire I let her in. I looked through the peephole as I listened through the earpice trying to hear the correct singing of the buzzer that would allow her in. As I saw her grow bigger, I pulled my face away, unlocked the door and opened it just a bit for her.

She smelled of alcohol and cigarettes. I must have drank water. Maybe this is when I grabbed a banana from our fruit ration above the fridge. I looked for my phone, half-remembering the intention, but not the act of distancing myself from it. We must have been both already in the room when I asked her if she had seen it. She was the one who got it from the night table. I clearly remembered consciously not bringing it in with me, as if having it in the same room as me would make it impossible to rest. I did not question it and just grabbed it.

There was no notification of new messages. I went to instagram and there was a red aura surrounding Clara's orange profile. I bit the inside of my cheek and slowly swallowed down. I did not want to open it. I cannot remember exactly how much I could hold it, but it must not have been long. I used the old trick I learn about gently swiping right from the story of the next person in the stack, if you do not pull the finger from the screen you can sneak a quick glanze of whatever the theme is of the story you are not seeing. The first video, taken from her hand I assume, did not have her in. Les rois mangeant. A group of people were grabbing donuts from a pink box on a bench. The camera slides through each of them, except herself, as they look at the box and grab something. The second video is a set of pictures tracking the progress of a knitted sleeveless sweater. I finally finished says the caption on the corner. After the last picture where the garment is finished, there is a video of her posing with it. She starts smiling and turns slowly showing it, herself; she grabs her hair that falls in front of her left shoulder with what I assume is the intention of moving it away. The video cuts without the culmination of this action.

I grabbed my phone. There was a notification for one new message, but not the one I have been waiting for. My mome asked me how my day went and how am I feeling with the medications. She finished her thought in a second message, te ves muy demacrada. She was referring to the story that I posted on Greenspot, while we were waiting for the waitress to come back and take our order. I looked at the camera—my phone's—with my camera sitting on the table in between. 26/36 in 24h. The other caption stated how this might be the fastest I've finished a roll. Just now that I looked at my phone, Clara was at top on the list of viewers, the first one who had not liked it. In the story itself, three hours ago, my mom wrote how I look thinner.

Yesterday evening I sent Majo a reel of instagram. It was the video of the contents of a cup of coffee, with the words in yellow swimming on top: And then it hits — you don't want him back. You just need to hear it was real, so your mind can finally let go. She sent back another one. It says: No me das igual, pero ya da igual. ¿Entiendes?

"no"

Today, I sent over Majo the edited messages from Alda's conversation that I repurposed into a haiku.

"Yo no sé si es tu culpa"

"no?" I was not expecting that. "creo que después de febrero, it's on me."

"No te quiero patologizar  "pero tus comportamientos son clínicos"

She continued listing my rigidness of thought, then my memory problems. I tried to think back if it was her or Fabiola, who urged me to ask Dr Franck if my obsessive traits in relationships were characteristic of my bipolar or just an unfortunate facet of my personality.

I remember now. Yesterday was another one of those days that we did not get up until well past the start of noon. I, out of nowhere, found a sliver of will and got myself outside my bed and my room. I went into the bathroom and took a shower. I could not say how long it had been since I put on the long-sleeve gray and white stripped shirt and never took it off.

"Do you want to go to the library with me?" I asked Sonny. Sundays the library closes at 17h. We had a couple of hours still for me to go there and pick up the handful of books that had been put apart for me. It must have been on our way there, but maybe it was on our way back, that we stopped by la boulangerie. I got myself a croissant this time, rather than a chocolatine. Whenever it was that we got home, I took on my pills and went to bed.

This morning it was different. I thought about asking Sonny to leave the curtains open, but I did not have to. I kept glanzing at the alarm, but it never stopped being early. At around 8h, I got outside and brewed us coffee. I sat in front of the computer and drafter an email to Louis, apologizing for probably missing today's meeting, sharing the little progress I managed and potentially scheduling a meeting some time this week. He replied back quickly, offering wednesday just before my scheduled coffee plans with Sarah, or tomorrow, right before my therapy session with Fabiola. I chose the latter, preconsciously forcing myself to keep a streak of getting up early in the morning. In his email of confirmation, he made sure to let me know that in case I wanted to bail, I need to do nothing more than just let him know.

My phone buzzed with a longer vibration than normal. Twice. The first time it was Sarah, sharing how she was just about to tell me see you tomorrow before looking at her agenda and realizing we planned for Wednesday. Something similar happen the first night we met. She made sure to send me a confirmation message the eve of the previous Saturday, gently reminding me we had scheduled for the next week. Had I not read her message, I would have gone and waited for her. The second was my mother, replying back to the 3 s video I forwarded her of me posing in front of the mirror with the black and red shirt I bought from our trip to Ardene.

Around noon, she replied back to my improvised haiku, letting me know of the plans Sonny and she had started before. We agreed to meet at 15h. I continued working and Sonny slept a bit more. We went together to a couple of second-hand shops, finishing at Ardene, where I got myself the mentioned squared shirt and two casual 5CAD t-shirts. We finished our day at Greenspot, where I shot today's IG story.

It's 22h26. I am still waiting, anxious, for a message that might not arrive.

### Tuesday, April 8th, 2025

 I never asked you to feel what I felt.

—Tess. The Last of Us.  This morning I had an alarm. The clock started roaring some time before 9h. Louis, as he said he would, reached out around the hour to let me know he was at the office or available for Teams at anytime. I am not sure about it, but I think he brought up again the liberty I could take of cancelling if I was not feeling up to it. I replied back asking for 10-15 more minutes. My plan was to get up and brew coffee. From my time I borrowed five to ten minutes to rest a bit more before starting the day.

Louis and I talked about my manuscript. Yesterday, despite all of our plans outside, I did find the time to finish up drafting the changes to the document. He had read some of it and would continue for the rest of the morning. The plan for me was to move on to the response to reviewers. After that, hopefully, we would manage to resubmit before he takes his next week off away in Martinique.

Yesterday I wrote about the story of the sweater. Between the start and the end of writing that last sentence I took a pause of writing—as the fourth episode of Last of Us was paused as well on the television in front of us—to explain to Sonny about my little trick of snooping on the content of an ig story from the next one in the stack. I tried it both yesterday and this afternoon. Both times I failed by the unfortunate feature of the application's algorithm of placing the people it knows I am more interested in seeing right besides my own story. By an also unfortunate trait of my personality that makes me view my own publications, her story opened right after mine finished. I saw her full smile and subtle twirling with her bare white navel over the orange pants and the almost pull of muted-down fire hair. I downloaded the video to preserve it further than its 24h lifetime. I saved it under the filename whydoikeepdoingthistomyself.

I continued working this morning after my meeting with Louis right until my appointment with Fabiola.

I have been chatting with Majo briefly. She sent me first an image of two basketball players on the court. On top of it the text in white says POV: when she randomly ghosts you which means she knows [you're] the one and she's just scared of "real love".

"Si lo hemos pensado, que fuerte," she continued.

In my session, I talked about the concert. How I felt undecided, confused. These past months with Clara, I have often felt confused. This time, though, this disorientation comes from within, from this inherent lack of understanding what is it that I am hoping to happen, what is it that I wish I could do.

Me siento atorada, atrapada, secuestrada.

I talked about wondering if this is an illusion of choice. If it is not just me playing the fool, pretending that I do not what I want to do, whether I hope she texted back about the concert or that I could tell her assertively that I cannot continue doing this, seeing her and feeling, exactly like I am feeling right now, the week or month after. Because, if I were to accept that I want to do the latter, I would have to face the reality that I am not able to. I cannot. It is not in me the strength of will to take this choice and commit to it enough to make it true.

"I would, I was asked by my flatmate but that wasn't sure and I can see it twice anyway"

Below her message, my phone showed another message asking me if I wanted to keep it showing me notifications like that one. I had to press a button making explicit that I was content with receiving that kind of notifications, that I was happy to receive that one particularly.

When I took a screenshot of the message I had been waiting days and nights for, below it and the phone's question, there were a couple of messages from Majo.

"Le pregunté a Aliza como te habia visto. "Y me dijo que te veías un poco apagada."

I have been following Dr Franck's advice of taking the pills earlier. Tonight I took them at 21h. It's three minute before 23h. I barely made it here without falling asleep.

### Thursday, April 10th, 2025

"i'm not sure but as she said she prob got scared it was going too quickly"and doesn't want to lead you on"

"idc, i want her to lead me on"i want her to break my heart and soul in pieces"  Just before the concert started, Clara had decided that she would leave at 22h, whether it had finished or not. She paused and then slightly bended her firmness with an addendum, unless you really, really wanted to stay. Had we actually left at 22h, had I not chosen to turn back at Jarry station and catch up with Sonny and Majo, had I not make use of the middle of the night as the canvas for my own intimate self-portraiture project, would I have enough time and energy to write these words in their due time?

I posted some stories about last (mid-) night's project. At first I shared them only to the twenty-something people that I hand-picked to be members of the close-friends feature. Sonny, being seated right besides me, was the first to see and liked the behind-the-scenes moments. Yet, when I went back to the list of viewers, it remained empty. We assumed it was a glitch. After some consideration, I ended up deleting them and just posting them openly for everyone to see them.

I compulsively went back to see the new names as they filled the list under viewships. There was one name in particular I was waiting for. When it finally appeared, I felt nothing. In the emptiness, then appeared a slight note of disappointment. I was hoping she would like them.

Around 5 minutes later, I received the notification I was hoping for. Clara a aimé votre story.

I opened up the application. Looking into it, opening the actual notification, the photo that came up was the one I posted this morning posing with the half-frame camera I told her about before the opener started. She had done what once charmed me: going back after hours of seeing a story to consciously and intentionally leave her mark on it.

Now, around half an hour later, her name jumped two or three people that had seen the stories after her. I suspect, but cannot be sure, that this is due to a coding change in the application that changed the list of expectators from being ordered by algorithmical-deemed closeness into a simple chronological order. Has she gone back to see the video and picture of me slowly undressing and exposing myself? Did she think back to that one night where it were her hands who exposed me?  I cannot recall at around what time we got out of bed. It must have been before noon, since I had to get ready and leave to meet Sarah. It most certainly have been well before noon, since I showered and we spent a significant amount of time evaluating the potential outfits I thought of wearing. I put and took off—now as I write it, perhaps as a foreshadow of the artistic exercise I would do twelve hours later—different skirts and sweaters, debating the options before settling on the plaid mini-skirt with red and gray tones over black, leggings underneath, and a white shirt under a light black sweater above.

I did not have enough time to put on make-up. I put on the red, puffy levi's winter coat and my brown boots. Since I lacked pockets wearing a skirt, I had to grab a purse to hold my stuff. I wore my music as an extra accesory, like another garment to cover myself from the cold.

As I was still yet to arrive to Jarry street, I received a message from Sarah letting me know she had parked at her usual spots by Parc Jarry and would be arriving in the next 15 minutes. My reply told her it would take me a similar amount of time to get there myself. I put the phone away in my coat pocket and continued walking.

I got there first. The café was much emptier than how it was the week before when I was waiting for Clara. There were many options for tables to sit. Rather than picking one, I went to the counter first. My order was an echo of what it had been the time before.

The barista was still working on my tea when Sarah arrived. She ordered a Mocha and then asked for the plant-based options for milk. Later she would make a reference to how, nowadays, they always carry a large selection for vegans like her.

I left her waiting for her order and grabbed the table by the window. I was sitting on the complete opposite wall of the café to where I was around ten days before. There was only enough time to place my glass on the table, my coat to my left, and my purse to my right, before Sarah came back to join me. I unwrapped the lomochrome film and put it in my camera as Sarah told me she had ordered herself the soup of the day. I could have eaten, I should had looked for the available food options to have something in my stomach before the coffee I had a couple hours before and the tea I would have during the next couple ones.

I went back to read what I wrote two days ago. I barely talked about going to Old Port with Sonny and Alda. I did not find where I wrote about how I finished the roll of black and white film, with each of the last handful of shots before the expected 36, felt more and more strange to wind up. By the last shot I take of a street lamp, after pushing the wind level, I felt and heard something worryingly similar to a tear. I could imagine the film separating from the empty canister where it would be rolled back. The grief of losing the 36 shots of the film that was going to end up being the fastest I shot fell down on my like the tiny glasslike snowflakes that had been raining on us the whole afternoon we had been outside walking with Alda.

As we walked down the street next to the river, I considered my options. The first and most hands-on and risky at the same time was to get the camera with me into my windowless restroom with the lights off, open the back of the camera and manually roll the film in order to put it in a black plastic container from where one of the rolls came. The second option, safer but at the same time dependent on the kindness and service of other people was to take the camera with me to Photo St-Denis and ask the guy behind to counter to help me extract the film in their dark room. We were halfway before arriving to Brewsky when I thought of a third option. I could ask Clara to take the place of the stranger from St-Denis, and do me the favour of saving my roll in her own dark room. I would pay her to have a film developed by her. I did not mind spending money to let hers be the first eyes to see my work, for her hands to be the ones who finished it.

This might have been before hearing back from her half-accepting the idea of my invitation. Then, it was another way I had come up, another excuse to justify reaching out to her.

We got to the brewery and sat down. My order was a lemonade and a bowl of fries—that might have been, as well, the first food I had for the day. I tried to roll back the film and try to blindly feel any sign of the exposed film rolling back into where it came from. When I felt something enough, I crossed my fingers and opened up the camera. There, waiting me, was only the cannister with no film hanging out of it. There was nothing left to ask from Clara.

For the next three hours, I summarized for Sarah the whole story of Clara, the five month situationship as I sold it to her, up to the last messages the night before and that same morning.

"I would, I was asked by my flatmate but that wasn't sure and I can see it twice already," she first accepted the invitation. She had a good reason to say no to, yet she came up with another reason to accept it instead. In bed, frustrated with the position I was led back to again, with having to face once again my lack of free will, my being obligated to not do anything except what my own desires force me to, I sent back the timings of the showings with available seats.

"Well, as it's in may i really don't know yet," she went away once again, hiding herself perhaps after feeling too exposed.

I brought up the other, closer, date in April with some seatings on the front row. "but it's still like 3 weeks?" I gave her enough space to free herself from me and run again. Then I took a step back myself, "and we have more pressing issues."

"Yeah for tonight I will do my best to arrive around 7:30" She saw the opportunity and took it.

"i trust you'll find me."

I told Sarah how I had decided that I would not reach out to her; I would not text her about arriving or waiting for her; I would not give her my location. If she wanted to found me, she would have to search for me.

When we said good-bye, before we hugged and went our separate ways, Sarah told me how she partly wished that Clara would not reach out, that she would not look for me. Maybe that would make it easier for me to let this end.   I came back to my apartment. On the other side of the opened door, there was nobody to receive me. Sonny must have left. In her place there was just enough time to put on make up and head down to the city centre.

I put on effort to make myself pretty. I coloured my eyes, my cheeks and my lips. I forgot to put on perfume, as later in the night Majo would have reproached me.

I made it to the venue around 15 minutes before the time Clara had said she would be arriving. I stayed in the back and placed my coat on one of the several handrails that were available. I took out my phone and browsed reddit trying to kill time.

"I should be there in 15 min" was her first text shorly after I have settled there.

It felt weird not saying anything back. I did not want to just ignore her. "it's emptier than i thought it would be" I sent as a compromise to myself nine minutes after.

Another exactly nine minutes later, she reached out again.

"Where are you?"

I must have found her effort sufficient, since I started giving her my location as a reward. I had not sent the last text, when she was standing behind me, holding her coat and wearing a sweater that I found too familiar. She hesitated as she opened her arms to reach me. Was she unsure if I would welcome her, or was it the idea of opening herself up to me what made her stumble?

We had thirty minutes before the start of the show, half-an-hour to be with each other and talk. We used that time to move into the crowd. She told me how she had slept only two hours—would that end up being a callback to the two hours I had slept two dates before where things took a turn?—and she would have to wake up at 5h the next morning. It was here when she brought up leaving early. I shared with her how I had bought a new camera after trying to fix the broken one a last time and giving up on it entirely. We talked about small snaps of our lives, safe subjects that would not alter this fragile stability in the unnamed and uncatalogued relationship that remains from what we had built these past months.

[...]

### Friday, April 11th, 2025

We were walking down the stairs inside the metro station when I saw her. Some reason made me look back and there she was, putting on chapstick, yellow strands of hair dripping under her beanie. I turned completely and I saw her except she was not her. I kept looking anyway, almost begging her to go back to being who she was not.  The lights dimmed and darkness around us fell like the last blanket of snow in spring. Several cones of yellow fel upon a man standing right in the middle of the scenario, guitar hanging from his shoulder. He might have said something before he started singing.

I had assumed that after the appearance of the opener until the encore, Clara and I would not have another chance for conversation. I was wrong.

"He looks like a kid from high school," she whispered just for me. "You know, a sad boy with a guitar, but still he gets all of the girls." I appreciated the closeness that came from her intention to be heard.

The guitarist continued with his song, indifferent to this, our own little moment.

We continued having this little comments, visiting each other's personal space only for these little exchanges. We talked about the similarity between all of his songs, the people above us in their personal chairs on the balcony, the shaggy hair that made it almost impossible to see the musician's face. Somewhere between his third and four song, I asked her: "was this kind of sad boy your type in high school?"

She hesitated, perhabs of embarrasment but maybe only as she tried to remember. She smiled as if she had been caught. Her answer had some flavor of affirmation.

The opener played his songs for around 30 minutes. She seemed proud of him, as she really saw him as a teenager playing for a first time in front of a large audience. Her own innocent sad boy.

The lights came up and a cover of Changes, started playing muted in the background as the techs moved like ants preparing the scenario for the main act. We had another 30 minutes for being with each other.

I asked her about her high school. She told me about how they were separated by groups, the sciences, the humanities, literature. Herself was part of a group of artistic bohemians, going around playing music and putting flowers in each other's hair. I asked her if she kept contact with some of them.

She did not ask but I offered her a glimpse of my own high school life by letting her know I was part of a group that shot short films and would go to the movies every week. I made no mention of me going to an after class group of young writers of fiction nor that I keep no contact with a single person from that period of life. The ones who were close to me have gone away and to those who were not close I have grown unrecognizable. She made a slight gesture of appreciation to my token of information. I was not sure how sincere it was. I did not think at all if this was related to an uncomfortableness of me potentially not yet being a woman back then or perhaps a caution to not intrude into private memories pertaining to a reserved past for the same reason.

She told me how she felt excited about seeing Tamino. Seven years ago she had seen him with a friend in a festival and it had been a special moment. The connection to that cherished moment elevated what could have been just another concert. She asked me if there was any artist who were similar for me, who held special significance. My first thought went back to the concert I told her about that night of January. I was sitting in this exact spot where I am writing this and she was not yet in my arms. Right after I bought the tickets after she told me she had never been to a concert by herself, I told her how I had been to only one. I saw Damien Rice in a venue somewhere in Mexico City. I had bought the tickets months in advance and looked forward to the event just like I did this year.

There was a large reddish light behind him that made his appearance a shadow. He sang some songs I recognized and some that I did not. Clara here and then would close her eyes. I thought it was because of tiredness, but she told me later it was to be more present in the moment.

The whole concert she kept the can of Coca-Cola that she bought to get some caffeine. She asked me if I wanted anything. I considered it but decided not to tell her that I am trying not to drink. I offered to share something with her. Here it was when she mentioned wanting an energy drink or something with caffeine, while at the same time being resistant to pay ten dollars for a red bull. I offered to get it for her, but she was reluctant to the idea. I went to the bar with her where she ordered her soft drink. Before she spoke to the barman, she asked me if I had anything I would not drink, perhaps considering still the idea of sharing it with me. In the end, I let her have it. Through the concert I noticed the tint of pink that stained the tip of the straw. At first I wanted to taste it, then I wanted to go directly for the source of its colour.

One moment in the first half of the concert, I felt her full side of her body pressing me. She turned her head and softly asked me to squeeze a little to the left. I was not sure whether to take it as a plead to give her back her space. Still, all throughout the rest of the concert, I craved her coming back and feel the warmth of the presence pushing into my side. The urge to raise my hand and push it through between her arm and body, grew inside my stomach and expanded like a balloon about to burst. I would try to keep it in by holding my arm in front me of me. Once or twice, I could not help to raise my hand and brush my finger over the texture of her sweater, trying to feel her body through it, unsure if I wanted her to feel me in the opposite direction of my act. For every time that she came back and I got intoxicated with her closeness, she would pull away to look from the other side of the head of the person in front of her.

Tamino started playing the intro to Indigo Nights and the crowd clapped in excited appreciation; she was part of it. She closed her eyes and mouthed the words as if they were a prayer. Thousands of people connected through his song, all focused on the artist singing; all of us except me, whose eyes were fixed on this young woman with her eyes closed lost in the moment. What would I not have given in exchange to hear the song in her voice rather than the artist's I overpaid to see.

I do not remember where was it that I saw the time of her departure had passed us by like a stranger on the street. I thought about mentioning it, but swallowed it instead. Perhaps it was a quarter of an hour after it that Tamino said Thanks and announced it would be his last song. When he finished, Clara turned and asked me if I thought he would come back.

"Of course he will. The question is how many songs is he going to play."

She guessed that maybe just one. Myself, I proposed two or three.

The third song of his encore was the much awaited Habibi. It was announced by a long and emotional solo of his cellist. By the time the song together with the concert ended, there was this aura of satisfaction surrounding the whole audience.

"Shall we go?" I softly suggested.

We left half-pushed by the crowd as if we were being carried by a gentle river to the exit. I put on my red coat and started buttoning it trying to hold the warmth before stepping outside.

"Do you know what is the closest metro station?" I asked her, knowing full well that St-Laurent was right around the corner.

"The orange line," she said with a mute hint of a question. I appreciated her mistake. We continued chatting about the show for the eight minutes that it would take us to the Berri metro station.

We headed down the stairs, our homes in the same direction. We got to the platform. She sighed when we saw the next train would arrive in another eight minutes.

I brought up how after the last time we saw each other when I had told her I had a hundred questions, I went home and started thinking of some that I had missed. I decided to write them down in my phone. I shared with her that I had gotten to 53. I am not sure what I was expecting from her hearing this, as if it were some sort of achievement. I confessed that some of them were questions that I probably would not want an answer to; others were dependent on the question before. She agreed that this was some sort of cheating.

"If one is a yes or no question, then it's a given you would want a follow-up. That must count as a single question." She never asked me for what kind of questions were on my list.

The train finally came and its doors opened for everyone and not only us. We boarded together. People faster than us grabbed seats. I went to a place by the opposite doors, resting myself on the handbars to its left.

I pointed to it and offered it to her, but she said her place by the handbars on the center of the car were fine for her. "It's not very comfortable, but it's fine."

Sherbrooke. Mont-royal. Laurier. Rosemont.

"This is you."

In the process of the train arriving to the station before stopping, she stepped closer, this time with no hesitation before opening her arms to me. With the same decisiveness, her face went straight over my right shoulder as we hugged. I kissed her on her cheek. We separated before the doors opened; this time it felt as if they had done it just for her.

"Don't be a stranger," I threw at her, a plea dressed up in wit and false confidence.

She caught it, took a look at it, and remained unsure of what to do with it. She turned to me, with the face of someone about to object or dismiss an accusation. I imagined I heard the start of a why in the form of a whisper, but no sound came from her. Her mouth stopped moving, perhaps realizing there was reason behind it and the past was on my side.

She stepped out the doors. They closed, leaving her out and trapping me in.

I grabbed my phone and typed down in the messages app.

"idk what i miss more, sofibug or your old way of saying goodbye"

Beaubien. Jean-Talon. Jarry.

I saw in my phone I had a text from Majo, asking me if the concert had ended. It was timed approximately when we were exiting the venue and were just starting our walk back. She then told me she was with Sonny, still at Dieu du ciel! Had I seen and replied to it promptly, I could have asked her to join them and be the one leaving Clara on the train a station before.

I climbed the stairs. Rather to walk to the right and take the escalators to the exit I headed to the left and went back down to catch another train in the opposite direction. I rode the same way back to Laurier.

I met up with Sonny and Majo. Like last time at Brewsky, I ordered from the waiter a non-alcoholic ginger beer.

"She is not ugly. She is so not ugly," I exclaimed defeated to Majo and Sonny.

On the other hand, María said that I looked pretty. I ignore if she noticed the sense of accomplishment I felt.

We stayed on the bar around an hour just before Majo had to leave to catch the last metro back to Verdun. We said our goodbyes and descended the two stairs to the platform, Majo on the right, Sonny and I the ones on the left.

I told Sonny how I still wanted to do the photoshoot we had been joking about the past week.

In Clara's conversation on instagram there is only a handful of pictures shared in there. The first one is the self-portrait she took of us following the instructions of the card game we played; her smile in the picture seems sincere. Another one is the one of the Yashicaflex and the olympus, both cameras never-used by me sitting on my night table. I put a roll on the olympus and it ended up not functioning properly. I thought about putting one on the medium format one, but in the end decided to wait. Weeks later, after Clara asked me out for the first and last time by inviting herself to my place, when we were together, sat together, held each other—she first inside my arms on the black couch during the late night, then me in hers on my bed during the early morning—I did not think of using it with her. The thought came after she had left in the morning, after things had took a turn to never be the same.

For a couple of weeks, I imagined about asking her to test the camera with me. Sit each other in front of the mirror, taking turns capturing each other, exchanging the opportunity of seeing how we look in each other's eyes. The opportunity of this, just like being held by her and having my hair played by her fingers again, never came to happen.

The idea of being photographed by her, as time passed, slowly changed into being photographed by myself. Taking the role of both subject and object. Showing myself, exposing me, in my own terms, having full control of how I am seen, even to my own eyes.

I grabbed the lightscreen, the tripod, the camera and we started to work. Slowly, with each passing shot, I took off my clothes that kept me covered, safe. In the first shot we took sitting on the living room I wore the full outfit in which Clara hugged me, in which I sat down at the bar with Majo, in which I rode the metro back home with Sonny. Then I took off my coat. Then I unbottoned my shirt. Then I slide off my socks and my black leggings. Then I took off the gray undershirt, but kep the white blouse flowing open exposing my white bra. Then I unhooked the bra and covered only my breasts with the hanging sides of the shirt. Then I let the skirt fall off to the floor and the blouse fall off behind my shoulders. That was the last of the 12 pictures of the set.

After we were finished, we came outside the room and I took off the roll of 120mm film. I licked the adhesive to close the fruit of my artistic endeavor. Sonny and I took a picture together, smiling as I showed off the small roll that held off our night of work.

The next day, on the morning as we drank our coffee, I posted a story holding the camera that I had received the day before. It snowed two days ago. Today was Christmas morning. Half a day later, after I went out to the photo lab, to the bank, to IGA, and then back home, I posted the behind-the-scenes photos and videos that Sonny had taken.

Just now, their 24h lifetime has finally ended. I might post them again on my profile next Wednesday when I receive back the scans, if, hopefully, they come back any good.

### Saturday, April 12th, 2025

 Quel est le mot qui te fera apparaître, dis-moi, ce n'est pas ton nom, ni le mien.

Et si nous en changions, l'espace d'une journée ?

Le silence aujurd'hui est plus fort que l'océan, c'est le contraire d'un souhait, un désavœu.   I had forgotten I muted Clara's stories this morning when I asked Sonny to pass me my phone and, as an old habit not-quite-dead yet, I went into her conversation in instagram and saw a red halo around her profile picture. I hesitated about opening it; if I had decided to mute them, I assumed it was because I wanted not to see them. Right behind the curiosity about its content, there was the doubt about its lifetime. Another potential reason for this measure could have been to help me not to be one of her stories first viewers. As I write this, I wonder why would that make any difference or be worthwile of worry.

I opened it before I got out of bed. It was a photo of her, taken with a digital camera and edited—perhaps overly, to my own taste—by a friend of hers. Rather than herself, the subject of the photograph, as focused by the lightning and emphasized by the intentional edits, were her blue eyes.

Nowadays, whenever I think back to that night of January or that particular goodbye in the metro, following the almost-worn-out memories comes the doubt about how am I seen by those pale winter eyes.

Last night we planned coming here to the library. I gave Sonny the opportunity to choose whether we would come just to return the books before heading back home or staying in for a bit. I realized that I could make her a library account putting in my address as hers. Without requesting a physical card for borrowing books, there was no need to actually provide a named proof of address. This online-only account was all she needed to connect to the internet.

I grabbed my new canon camera and carried it in my hand the whole trip here. During the concert, after I told Clara about my purchase and how eBay gave me 30 days for trying it out in case I wanted to return. She worried for me that 30 days would be a bit short to test it out, particularly due to its half-frame nature that doubles the extension of a regular roll. The camera is placed to my right, besides my black iPod and small leather-bounded travellers notebooks. I could grab it and check the exact number of pictures that I have taken. Without this, my guess is that the amount of pictures is somewhere over 20. Although definitely higher to my usual rate of taking pictures, it is still a humble figure relative to the goal of 72.

Last night I cooked an exaggerated amount of fried rice. Following the usual recommendation in online recipes, we used almost everything we had in the fridge at our disposal. Being an old go-to for me, this was the first time that I cooked this dish after starting my vegetarian diet. There were enough leftovers to last us maybe two more servings each.

In the freezer, there is a ziploc bag holding half of the vegetarian bolognese sauce made with red lentils. The night that Majo brought Sonny home, she mentioned casually having a tupperware with pasta. Later she precised how it was the leftovers from the dinner she had at Jana's. She had loved the red lentils sauce Jana had made. Sonny and I looked for a close recipe online and decided to give it our own try. It was the first dish we cooked.

Since it's the weekend, the library will be closing in approximately an hour. When we got out of the elevator on the third floor, as usual, Sonny decided to stay on one of the chairs facing the window. I continued and found this spot on the very end of the library, between the third and second floor. Fifteen minutes ago I texted that we could go eat a burger at A&W, if she were hungry, or head to La graine brûlée to continue working. We decided that whenever I finish this, I will pass to pick her up and head over to the burger joint.

The night I met Clara—or was it then the early morning of the following day already?—we left the bar looking for an open place to eat and ended up at an A&W. I remember she was wearing a brown oversized leather jacket over perhaps-gray jeans. Myself, I wore a red dress. The thought of wearing it for the concert, of letting the dress bookend whatever was it that we were, never crossed my mind.

 "Toujours le bruit de l'eau"   It is almost half-an-hour past midnight. Not only is it late, but I also took my hours significantly long ago. I asked permission from Sonny to bring my laptop to the bed and try to finish this before falling asleep.

It has been years since the last time that I have written here, lying on my bed, face down, with the computer where my pillow and my head should be.

I put an alarm this morning. I turned it off without thinking. We continued sleeping until around noon.

Last night, I shared several stories on my instagram. Already in bed, I think, not much before falling asleep, I posted a last video. It was a clip that Sonny took of me as I pointed my canon camera towards her and made the gesture of taking a picture. The video she shared with me is around 30 seconds. I edited in my phone, extracting the main portion of it on which the background music adds a nice, dreamlike touch. I corrected the colour, maybe cropped it to improve a bit the composition.

Moments before getting the will to get out of bed, I grabbed my phone and went to check the updated list of the people who had seen it. By the bottom there was Clara's name. I could not say whether she had seen it before falling asleep or early in the morning before starting her day. It did not matter, I just kept the idea that she had been one of the first people to see it for whatever reason.

We had decided to cook breakfast this morning. When we planned our evening surrounding the movie, Tú me abrasas, that we were watching at Cinéma Moderne, we decided to pass by the gnocchi place. That would be our light dinner.

This morning I brewed our coffee and cooked tomato, jalapeño, onion, spinach, and vegetarian sausage with eggs. After breakfast I took a shower. I told Sonny that, for the first portion of the day, we could go to Parc Jarry, and kill some time walking around there before heading to Mile End.

We head out the house. I put in both cameras with film in it, the Pentax and the canon, into the small red backpack together with the latest book from the library and a water bottle. I kept taking pictures all along our way. I wanted to finish the purple film. By the time that we were going to Alda's I ended up finishing it.

We strolled throughout one end of the park to the very other.

We took the 55 bus and got off just one or two blocks before La drogheria fine. There was a long line of people outside the window with two women inside serving chinese takeout boxes with gnocchi from a large pot. We decided to share a single box the two of us. I ordered it and Sonny paid with my debit card that I had given her a couple of minutes before. We sat down on a round coloured bench  and ate our food.

We went to the café with plenty of time before the movie. It was completely devoid of customers. Nobody except a barista and another worker were inside. I ordered Sonny a pint of beer and got myself a london fog. We stayed outside on one of the tables until five minutes before the start of the movie.

We were two out of around 7 people in the whole theater. The first short film directed by a quebecoise film-maker was in German. I did not like it, but Sonny found it good enough. I did enjoy the movie even though I cannot find the words to describe it now that I am drugged by sleeping pills and exhaustion at 1h39.

I exchanged messages with both Majo and Alda. We headed out when the movie ended. Instead of the metro as I thought we would, we took the 30 bus to Alda's sister's place. We struggled to find the house since it was hard to see the numbers in the darkness of the night.

Despite Majo saying she would arrive late—she was still at De l'eglise when the movie had already ended—she texted me she was outside not long before we got there.

I had posted another story from the Park—a video Sonny took of me as I was trying to take a picture of a squirrel—when I saw its viewers and the ones from the one of yesterday, I noticed that Clara's name was much higher on the older video.

With a little experiment on Sonny's phone, I realized that it does indeed mean that her appearing higher does in fact mean she went back and reviewed the old video she had already seen.

I do not who is worse, she going to my name on the very end of the app or from my the picture at the top of my profile to review an old story—but not the second most recent one since her name there remains at the bottom—or me, who has become obsessive enough that is able to notice this.

### Monday, April 14th, 2025

 Now that I have hormonal cycles again, my freckles decided to come back stronger than ever.   I am not sure what was it that pushed me to get out of bed for my laptop and try to write in my journal last night after midnight. There is this feature that patches skipped days after writing twice the 750-words goal. Not only was I exhausted from regular tiredness, but had to carry my mind through the fogginess caused by my medication.

I have not read whatever I wrote. I have the vague memory of it not making much sense at all.

I fell asleep without any expectations of waking up early and starting a working week. This week Louis is enjoying his time off with his family on an island in the Caribbean. I was instructed by my psychiatrist to take some time off. I have a perfect excuse—if not actually a valid reason—to not be working right now.

On my email inbox are the corrected and commented documents from Louis. The only step left is accepting whatever he deemed improvable and the details he suggested. Then, with these end products from almost half-a-year of work, resubmit my work to be reviewed again.

Tomorrow will be the mid-mark of the month. Some days ago I went online exploring the websites of CIHR, trying to find any hint in past links of when could I expect the results of last year's project proposal. The closest thing I found was a link with fellowship resutls dated April 30th. Literally, the latest possible date of the expected April. A bit over two weeks still. Whenever I think of it, I can feel a tornado on the mouth of my stomach.

This morning, after coming out of my room, I brewed coffee but made no breakfast. We had just enough grounded coffee for today's two cups. I used Baristello's closing times at 15h as motivation to change and get out of the house.

Last night I ended up finishing the purple lomography film roll that I had put on the Pentax camera. I took it out on our walk from Cinéma Moderne towards the bus stop on the way to Alda's sister's house. At first I thought of taking it in whenever I could go to pick up the negatives I am waiting for still. Remembering that the wait-time for colour negatives is just a single day, I decided instead to use the excitement of seeing these new pictures as a way of managing the expectations—splitting the waiting into something more manageable.

I exchanged my pajama pants with a pair of white oversized jeans. I did not put on a bra nor changed my t-shirt, but just covered it with the gray hoodie that Sonny has been borrowing these past few days.

The first step was to buy the bag of beans from the italian café.

I continued to the metro station and rode the orange line until Sherbrooke. I did not take any pictures nor stopped on the clothing store with announced sales to browse their pants similar to the ones that I asked Sonny for when she was in Europe but could not get for me. I got inside Photo St-Denis. There was a line of people waiting. As always, I decided against speaking in French in this photography context. I confirmed that the negatives would be ready tomorrow and paid with my phone.

Rather than go back to the metro, I walked ahead to the bus stop for the 30 bus. I continued reading Truismes from Marie Darrieussecq on the three or four minutes that I waited for the bus to arrive.

I got off a bus stop before the one across the street from my apartment building. The last stop was IGA to buy some food that we could prepare tonight as we wait for the lentils bolognese sauce to defreeze. Sonny asked me to get a bunch more ingredients, but I argued against it. I did end up buying more stuff than I was planning for, although most of it were non-perishables.

When I opened the door of my apartment and got inside, I asked for Sonny without getting back a response. I approached my bedroom. Peeking in, I realized it was as empty as I suspected it. Not even five minutes later, she texted me asking to let her know whenever I arrived.

Sonnyate > Asómate por la ventana

I look through the balcony and saw her sitting down on one of the chairs that I must have photographed on one of the rolls are that are waiting to be developed.

 Tu dis peut-être  J'entends espoir

Tu dis suif  J'entends cire

Tu dis je ne sais pas  Je n'entends plus que ton souffle entre les mots, la nuit entre les jours   Yesterday was a full day. I cannot remember most of what happened. Again, days have accumulated and I've lost track of their content; my small pocket notebook lagging behind.

Tuesday means I had a session at noon with Fabiola. I had nothing in particular that I felt must have been brought up. Except that the concert I had been waiting—in one way or another—since January took place in that past week.

I narrated, perhaps as a brief summary of what I had written here before, how the day of the concert developed. I met with Sarah, I told her—both Sarah in my story and Fabiola that midday during session—about how I decided to become vegetarian. After bringing up the missing context about the Princess Mononoke showings, the latest messages I received from Clara, and my resolution of not settling the details about the concert as a passive way of making her be the one who reaches out, for once being her searching for me; a quiet waiting for her to come to me.

I trust you'll find me.

I concluded Sarah's prelude of that past Wednesday by telling Fabiola how, when saying goodby, she wished for my own good that Clara would not reach out nor look for me.

I then finished introducing the day before the concert talking about the way that Clara, in her own way, did end up looking for me and finding me.

Then it was all about the concert. Fabiola was who asked me about it. I was content talking about how I have not drunk this past week; how the several times that I was with my friends, even when going to bars, I had no trouble staying sober. I related it later in the session, to how I have not had any significant difficulties keeping my vegetarian diet. I do not miss meat in my meals, as I have not really missed alcohol on my nights out. I mentioned how I get this slight feeling of satisfaction when I stand my ground. I cannot recall with precision, but I must have mentioned the previous Sunday, when we were all at Alda's house and she had ordered ribs—she had this intention of me pausing on my diet to try them out, but I said not. When I continued talking about the reasoning behind adopting this new diet, I talked about this artificial sense of control; anytime that I have sufficient will to deny a particular dish or to pick a drink out of the non-alcoholic section of the menu, I can counterbalance the frustration born from all the many other ways that I have felt driven by a foreign pull losing my autonomy and free will.

If I indeed mentioned that moment at Alda's house, I most probably did not bring up how Majo annoyed interrupted me to emphasize her not buying my little joke of feeling better than everyone and how, to everyone, it is perfectly clear that I keep this up as a pathetic way to somehow feel connected to Clara.

I talked about the concert. I talked about the preamble of messages preceding her arrival culminating in me finally drafting the final text with my location inside the venue just before turning and seeing her standing behind me after having found me. I omitted how she asked me to move into the crowd. I went into the hour we had to talk surrounding the brief opener by Tamino's guitarrist.

In detail and in particular, I talked about two moments and one idea. The first was her comment, following up on her sharing she had not sleep the night before, that she would not have gone had it been her going by herself. Then, perhaps noticing the implication about my company, graciously backtracked stating that she most probably would have. The second was her statment about leaving at 22h independently of whether the concert had finished or not; an assertion that was then revised by her unless you really want to watch the whole thing, once again, subtly implying the value of my company.

The other thing I talked about the concert was how I rather look at her than the scenario. I told Fabiola about this damned dance she seemed to perform on which she would be so close to me that I would feel my stomach turn over itself by the over-conscious sensation of her body pressed to mine and then, just as I failed to contain my wish to raise my hand and press my fingers through her sweater, she would pull away out of reach, moving her head to see through the other side of the person in front of her. And then, for some reason or another, she would be back in my reach, just enough so I could feel again her full left side of her body graze me once again.

That whole back-and-forth symbolized this past month or two.

I am a rock and she is the ocean. She comes and goes as waves, crashing over me and then leaving nothing but her memory in foam. Each return—a caress—wearing me down, unmaking me slowly without mercy; each one carrying the quiet threat of being the last. And I, like the rock, cannot move—bound to the shore of her; inert, unable of pulling away; wanting and unable.

By the end of the session, Fabiola suggested that we put a pause to the whole theme of Clara—to the fruitless effort of trying to ascribe meaning to where it might be none.  After my finished session, the second half of the day started with Sonny's. I lied down on my bed listening to my iPod, as she talked—and even laughed—during her time with Fabiola. By the time the clock should have announced the end of the session, without taking my earphones out, climbed on my bed and peeked over the division that disguises my studio as a one-bedroom. Sonny later told me that whenever one of Fabiola's dogs make a fuss behind her softly interrupting their session she exclaims perrito!—when noticing my head poke up in her digital reflection on the screen. she, once again, blurted out perrito!

Today was supposed to be the day the negatives from my little artistic project would be ready. Later this month was when the results from the CIHR fellowship application would be posted. Both came before I expected and accompanied by a hesitant anxiety—the first welcome, the latter with a weight I was not ready for.

I cannot say if we sat down to see the firs output of my medium format yashicaflex on the television before or after our therapy sessions. After them, we headed out to the photolab to pick up the negatives—surely the purple one that I had completed the night before and potentially the other two black-and-white that were only perhaps ready.

I shared with Sonny as we walked towards Photo St-Denis how it was one of the few places where I have not dared to switch over to speak French. Perhaps of this unasked confession, I asked about the negatives in French. The young man behind the counter told me he would check and that hopefully they would be ready although uncut.

We left the place with the four set of rolls and continued walking a couple of blocks to another photography store I had never been to and we were both meaning to check out. I did not buy any film, but Sonny got herself a toy colorful camera and a roll for testing it out.

We wanted to check out a café before taking on the invitation from Alda to head over to her sister's place to have pizza again for dinner. We found Chez Popo on the maps and wanted to have a coffee there—mostly due to the childish amusement we got from its name. Unfortunately, the opening hours on the map were only for Thursday and Friday.

We finished our night at Alda's temporal place, helping her cook, accompanying her on Brioche's walk, sharing her dinner and watching the first episode of The Pitt—the TV show she has been insistent we give it a chance.

By the time we made it home, I started editing the 12 6-by-6 self-portraits I had been surprisingly happy with after waiting close to a week to see them.

Two days ago, the epilogue I wrote before the entry was the caption that was uptop Clara's story, a video taken of a shoreline, or maybe a beach. Yesterday, a follow-up story of hers—this time available only to her selected close-friends—showing her feet welcoming the water, her toes tinted red. Instead of a caption, there was a poll, in French, asking about the cause of the redness. I voted for quiting her job, like most of the members of this restricted group, those who are actually part of her life. The focus of the video—or was it just a still?—was not the cause we had to guess. My eyes went to the red, but not on her toes; it was wrapped around her ankle.This time it was not too small, it was not moving. It did not dance on dangling feet, ankles circling in echo of the pole she was gripping. Now, it was just there; clear, immobile, and obvious. The time between that night back in January and the concert planned months in anticipation is the same as the time between the red lace on wet ankles washed by the sea and the small and humble jewelry I brought her as a small gift from my trip back home. That symmetry makes it harder to be certain the two are one and the same—or to be convinced they are not.

Back on Sunday, when we all shared our evening at the apartment Alda was housesitting, I tested something out, for a reason I have since forgotten, with Sonny's phone and instagram account. It is now possible to see when someone, anyone, for whatever reason, returns to watch a story they have already seen. That small and petty empirical experiment allowed me, today, to catch Clara—like the sea brushing the same stone twice—coming back to two videos she had already seen: the first of me turning to the camera over my shoulder with a childlike excited grin, both before and after high-fiving Brioche; and another, again from behind the same right shoulder, where I scan the negatives of my self-portrait project of photographs of myself undressing from the same blouse and skirt she saw me in, for the last time, a week ago.

"No es que importe o signifique algo," I wrote on my friends' groupchat. "Solo no entiendo."

"No hay nada que entender" replied Majo. "Como dice Natalia, es imposible borrar las cicatrices de amar y no saber soltar."

"Yo o ella?"

"Both"

Majo must be right; there’s nothing to understand.

But still—she comes back.

### Thursday, April 17th, 2025

I am a rock and she is the ocean.

She comes and goes as waves, crashing over me and then leaving nothing but her memory in foam. Each return—a caress—wearing me down, unmaking me slowly without mercy; each one carrying the quiet threat of being the last.

I, like the rock, do not move—bound to the shore of her; inert, unable or unwilling of pulling away. Maybe the stillness is mine, too—a refusal disguised as inability. Some part of me chooses to wait for the tide, even knowing it will never stay.   I woke up early, but didn't. I had this unbearably headache that kept me down. We did not leave the bed, much less my room, before the sun was at its highest.

Before falling asleep, I look at the signs that I have ignored that warn me about a mixed episode. By now, I have mostly overcome most of the depressive symptoms that kept everyone around me on alert. But what about these other signs that have gone almost unnnoticed? I told Majo about the more than 2,000CAD that I owe on my credit card; the half-frame camera and the unneeded shoes. I brought up this unexpected creative outbreak that has allowed me to finish three complete rolls—one of them of more than 72 shots—without including the full self-portrait project that I shot, scanned, edited and wrote accompanying poems for.

Yesterday I had my session with Dr Franck. I did not mention the old suggested question about my obsessive traits. Instead I said I have, by now, started to get used to the new—quadrupled?—doses and sleep medication. Great. See you in a month. Thank you.

Last night I wrote mostly of the skipped day. I talked about the second night with Alda. The moments that inspired the two or three latest questions that I added to that entry in my notes where I enumerated all of the questions that remained unanswered. Why do I revisit that list as how allegedly Clara comes back to my stories? Is the hope that there will be a future opportunity to ask them sincere or just another sign of my impaired mental condition?

We talked about going out today to Photo St-Denis to leave the recently completed santacolour100. Yesterday I took the camera with me to my dimmed bedroom as Sonny was sleeping. I stood again in front of the large mirror and shot away until there were no film left inside the half-frame camera. The second portion of the plan was heading to the library. We did neither of those things.

In the morning I brewed coffee and tasked Sonny with cutting up the onion and the plant-based hot-dogs I bought on my last trip to the supermarket. Once I finished whatever I was doing, I went and cooked our breakfast. We sat and ate in front of one episode of The Pitt. When we were with Alda, we joked that she would leave us as homework to continue watching the series. We managed to complete a single episode before our attention drifted unto other things.

Perhaps it was then when I started drafting the text that would accompany my photographs. Most of the day I remained sitting on the always same side of my black couch. Sometimes, doing nothing, unannounced and uninvited, the thought of back to that January night comes to me and makes me turn my head where Clara was sitting, first on her own side, then resting her head on my shoulder before finally lying her full body unto mine.

When we went to bed last night, I first lied down on the side of the night table. I needed to charge my phone and the length of the cable did not allow me to go to my usual side. Whenever people come and sleep over, they always ask me the same question. Do you have a side?  All times I have said no; all times I have been then passively assigned to the same one. How many women have passed through my bed? Not all of them are people with whome I had sex. Paradoxically, those with whom I did not shared my body are who truly love me—or have done it once.

Tonight I posted the first of the ten photographs of the series. As Sonny suggested, I did first as a stories. First an introduction to the series, followed by the first picture.

Facing myself has always felt unfamiliar.Vulnerability had never looked back at me before.I sat in front of it, holding the full weight of being seen, and tried not to move.

Tomorrow, as soon as that one dies, I plan to post the second one.

### Friday, April 18th, 2025

 "Pendeja. Todo porque no lees tus pinches correos."   I think Sonny is upset with me now. I left her on one of those chairs by the windows on the third floor of the library. I am sitting on these long tables with people working on their laptops. I did insult her, annoyed by her not reading two particular emails from Tuesday and last week. I am aware how this action of leaving emails unopened—messages from people trying to reach you for one reason or another—hits me right in an unrelated open wound.

We got to the library and I offered to buy us coffee. We were waiting for our drinks when she tried to log in her account to make use of the WiFi. Of course she did not remember her account number, so she went to her emails to find it. She used BAnQ as the search word and opened the first email that showed up. When she tried to access with her account info, it bounce back with a very subtle warning stating that the account number was incorrect.

It was then that she went back to actually read the email. It turned out it was not the confirmation email notifying her that the account was made and ready, but an unread and much more recent one. This one was to let her now that her account had been deactivated due to a rule against nicknames or fictitious names. It urged her to contact some email address in case of wanting more information.

I scold her mildly for not reading it and then offered her to create a new one. It must had been due to her repeated last name. I did not remember but I might used just one of my last names when creating mine. I did not mind at all putting my same address since having flatmates is not unheard or uncommon at all. When it asked for her phone number, I hesitated, but ended up putting mine.

After the coffees were ready, when I was coming back to her from the counter with our drinks, she told me she had received another email contacting her about it. It explained further and in greater detail their concerns with her name and offered her to confirm that her name was indeed her full and correct legal name in order to reinstate her account. It then asked her if she had tried to make another account as they had found an older one with very similar information. I asked her from when this other email was, thinking they had just sent her. When she said that Tuesday, I got pissed off.

It was less then 30 minutes ago, but I think she triggered it by asking if they would delete my account since I tried to make a third one with the same phone number.

I called her Pendeja, and then scolded her, each word sharp and aimed to hurt.

Both of us remained silent in the trip on the elevator.  I asked her last night to open the curtains so I could be able to get out of bed early. This new set of sleeping pills have worked much more effectively than the last batch. I am not sure if I put an alarm, but I know I first woke up at around 8h.

I had a lot of dreams, vivid and strange. Not charged sexually anymore, since yesterday I masturbated, finally, during my night shower. Throughout all of my dreams I made  a huge effort to wake me up, aggresively pulling myself out to reality. Each time, rather than this world, I ended up still in another dream.

Closer to the morning, I must have woken up, seen the clock let out that noon had passed us, and got angry, at least five times. Each of them I would direct my annoyance at Sonny and blamed her for not completely opening the curtains as I had asked her to the night before.

In the end, the last of the times I woke up, this one for real—I hope—the clock marked 9h. I do not know if I was relieved by the morning or the fact that this felt much more real-like than the previous one. I still could not wake up fully. I continued lying there, eyes half-closed and body almost paralyzed.   We passed by Photo St-Denis to leave the roll. I bought a three-pack of Kodak Gold. Coming back to take the 24 bus, we entered the store that had a rack of pants outside the entrance. I bought two sets of them—one red-and-white and another orange. It must have been between then and having lunch at Shawarmaz that I opened up the first of the ten self-portraits that I had posted. At its 18h of age, Clara was now at the top of the list, just below the dozen of people that had liked it.

### Saturday, April 19th, 2025

"also, clara posted a video of her pole dancing... i lost like 5 days of progress not lusting for her"  I start almost the same way every day—talking about how I woke up, how difficult or easy it was to get out of bed, and the time that I eventually did do it.

Last night, the sleeping meds were the most effective they have always been. Just as the paperwork that the pharmacist gave me the first time I bought them said, in 30 minutes I found it hard to keep my eyes open and walk the dozen steps it takes from my couch to the bed.

Sonny remained out here and did several chores, some I did not even ask her to help me with. I woke up in the middle of the night, surrounding midnight, to my whole bed. I did not need to get up to find out Sonny was still home. I heard her voice as she spoke to her phone—I assumed. I turned but did not fall back of sleep. Instead I heard her conversation. If I focused enough, I could even hear the voice of her phone partner.

I am not sure, but she must have come back to bed at around 3h or 4h. I think I heard their last bits of their talk, as Sonny said she was going to grab another one of her strongest beers.

This morning, as I got up to brew coffee, I made some for the both of us without any intent or pressure to get her up with me. I was not surprised that she slept most of the afternoon.

I was about to forget about the scans of the latest roll of film—he Santacolor 100 that I shot on the half-frame canon. I got the email with the link to the files as I was working on the coffee. I downloaded them on mi iPad as it was finishing and I served it on our two mugs. I tried to cast them on the television, but the connection kept failing. I half-remember trying to review them on my laptop. There was no way of easily going from one file to another. I recall disconnecting the television with the hopes of it fixing the connectivity issues—that was with Sonny by my side and I know the first time I saw them it was all by myself—most probably I just saw them on the iPad.

Besides the contentment of knowing the camera works, I got some shots that I was really fond of. Particularly, I liked the last set of self-portraits that I shot in the dimmed room in front of the mirror. As I drank my coffee, I edited some of them on the IPad. Later, I posted the four final shots as a single post on Instagram.

After that, I continued working on editing the Markdown file of my journal.

This was another day that we stayed home with our same clothes the we slept in. I just turned towards Sonny seating besides me; she might have changed hers after her latest nap.

Like yesterday I kept checking the viewers of my story trying to catch Clara coming back to it. She first saw it last night, 42 minutes after I put it up. I kept in mind the 18 hours that had passed before she returned to see the first one again.

One of the times I looked for her name and found it right where it was when I went to sleep, it had changed in other ways. There was a red light circling her picture. The colour changed to green when I got to her profile. I thought about waiting, holding off seeing it—perhaps for a full day until it went away. I could not.

It was another video of her spinning on the pole. She was wearing a sports bra rather than the wine-coloured top of the previous one on which I first noticed the anklet. It was still there, dancing with her. Unlike the impulse of opening it, I did not think twice about pressing the heart-shaped button.

Hours later, in the afternoon, when I was sitting working on my journal on the PC, I got a notification with her name. She had followed my exampled and liked the post with the handful of portraits from the half-35. Not much after that, the next time I went to the viewers list, there she was. Her name and picture right below the couple of people who had liked it.

Today I posted the third of the set of ten two hours ago. She is the third name below the people with hears in their pictures.

### Monday, April 21st, 2025

"It is all about just one night—not the weeks before nor the months after. It is always just one fucking night."  We were supposed to meet Aliza an hour ago.

Today was about to be one of those days that do not happen. My body wants to wake up and I refuse. I keep my eyes closed and my body immobile, turn, push my head back down and return to not being.

In one of those briefs moments of wakeness, I asked Sonny to text Aliza.

I remained in that liminal state of consciousness for all morning and half of the afternoon.  It is hard to remember what happened yesterday. Sunday of resurrection. Most places were closed—just like today. We had plans in the evening to come over to Alda's sister's place again, like last Sunday, to watch the second episode of The Last of US.

We did not make breakfast. It was our plan—Sonny would make breakfast early and that would keep us satisfied until the evening when we would have dinner at Alda's. Instead, Sonny thought of going out for something—perhaps buying the mozzarella cheese that Alda had asked of us—and on her way there she could check if the pupusas place were open.

At whatever time it was that she came back, she did with the happy news that the restaurant was open. I showered and changed before we headed out to have lunch there. The second part of our plan was to head out to Mt-Royal for one or two hours. Then, we would come back for Alda's stuff we set apart and head out to our meeting with her and Majo.

We arrived to the restaurant and were surprised by how most of the tables were filled already. It took some time for the man that had received us the last time, came to our table and got us two sets of menus. By that point we already had talked about what we were going to order, and thus Sonny did.

I noticed how a man from one or two tables ahead kept looking at me. I made a comment to Sonny. Since he was behind her, she could not confirm to me that I was not imagining it.

A similar time passed before he came back with our food.

We finished and asked him for the bills. Time passed by next to us, but he never came back. I asked Sonny to go to the register and incite him to take our payment. I was getting anxious by the tumultous noice of the full restaurant.

We finally got out of there. We overestimated how the sunny weather would warm the city. We were not even by Jarry station, before we decided to turn back and come home. I think it was there when I asked her to come inside Jean Coutu to buy a set of razorblades to depilate my armpits and maybe my navel. Sonny got herself a package of pads. From there, we made a stop at the other supermarket on Jarry street—the same one where I said good-bye to Valerie before neither of us reached out to the other again. We got there the mozzarella cheese that Alda needed to finish the pizzas we were going to have for dinner.

I cannot say how much we stayed home before we headed back outside to take the 30 bus. I remember being rushed by the bus' ETA and not being able to find my keys. Fortunately I got back my airtag from the father of the kid who had found it on the street—with my phone I was able to track it within my house and eventually get to pick up the backpack that was hiding them.

I carried with me on my totebag: the red box of We're not really strangers that Alda lent me last year for my date with Clara, the pair of plairs that I borrowed for her coming back from my trip to try to fix the half-frame camera that stopped working, the deck of tarot that someone had proposed we bring to do readings among us, a four-pack of mexican cokes, the package of mozzarella, the two drinks that Sonny and I got for us, my Sony digital camera, and, lastly, my canon half-frame. I carried it with me all the way—from my apartment's building entrance, to the bus stop a dozen of steps away, to the walk from St-Hubert to the duplex.

On the way, Sonny asked to stop by a telephone booth. It was the golden hour, so we had a mini photo shoot right then and there. By the time we continued our walk, I had already shot more than 20 pictures on the Kodak Gold film that I put on the camera that same day.

Majo arrived at Alda's not much after us. At first Alda offered to cut some watermelon for all of us. Majo said it was her favourite fruit. Alda started cutting it, taking away the white stuff by the border, separating the sweet and juicy red core with the hard and tasteless peel. I exclaimed that she was taking out my favourite part. Alda froze and instintively offered the knife to me, as if my comment was reprimanding her. Instead, I reached to grab the part she was about to discard and brought it to my mouth. She continued cutting, and I kept enjoying the scraps that would have otherwise just gone to the thrash.

After eating the fruit, Majo went towards the living room. There she sat and caressed Brioche. Sonny and Alda remained in the kitchen, working on the two pizzas: one large for the three of them and a smaller, round, vegetarian for me. This time none of them pressured or pushed me to eat meat. Majo brought up again the stupid reason that motivated me for restricting my eating. And just because of her we cannot go to one fucking restaurant.

Before Sonny and Alda brought them from the kitchen, I was on the couch with Majo. We put on songs on the television and sang them outloud. It might have been there when the subject of Sofía—the girl Alda kissed back in Mexico City and whose telephone Sonny asked for last week—came up; if Alda was going to date someone Mexican, she had to familiarize with the culture.

That was the first tarot reading that we made. Alda questioning what was it going to happen with this girl. I gave some context to ChatGPT and then asked it to propose a spread. Alda pulled out the cards and I feed them back to the LLM. Finally, I asked the model to narrate out-loud its response for the amusement of us all.

The second reading was Sonny. She asked a deeper, more personal question: Am I ever going to get back on my feet?

The third one, Majo's, was something related to her relationship with Aliza. She has been having second thoughts about what has happened. I told her how I perceive that Aliza must be hurting, but I also made sure to admit that I was impartial—I over-relate to being in this weird state of connection, where I am not sure if the person is really there or not. I could not pay attention to her reading, since I was busy updating my ChatGPT on the latest context related to Clara for the question of my own reading.

Like the night before and the one before that one, I kept going back to the viewer's of my story—this time the fourth of the series of self-portraits that I set to post each night. The one before was the first one after three continuous days on which she did not return. She would not come back yesterday either. Later in the night, after the last reading of Alda—a more personal one on which she asked about the state of her future career—when we continued talking about my obsession and fixation trying to look for meaning where there is none, when Majo brought up my reasoning for forbidding meat from my diet, they noted and scolded my compulsive checking over and over of who views, once or multiple times, whatever I select and publish.

I cannot say if all of this happened before or after the episode ended. I do remember that, maybe without really being aware at the moment, the wound that opened and kept me bedridden for the first half of this day was already there.

Late at night, already on my own bed, I went back to the text I had written around a month ago, dissecting whatever was unsaid in those two blank spaces of her first of many resurrection texts. I debated whether to post it as the latest entry in my series of post-midnight thoughts—or oversharing. I asked Sonny which between this poetic analysis on top of the photograph of a rock with a pair of shoes and abandoned bread or the more literary-conventional poem below my black-and-white picture of a rock and the sea I could post. Her answer was neither. In the end, I posted something else that I had drafted months before: Extraits from Barthes analyzing one who waits and the nature of the waited being.

All of those stories, except the latest video I posted of myself—smiling, as a stark contrast of the melancholy that has been afflicting me today—have been seen by Clara. But only once.  I came to you, an expert tarot reader, for advice. I am confused—despite everyone around me saying it is done and I am fixating on nothing.

I want to know what is going on with the story revisiting; why is she doing it, what does it mean and what is gonna happen afterwards.



When there’s confusion, lingering energy, and a loop that seems invisible to everyone else but painfully alive to you—tarot doesn't give definitive answers, but it can name what’s unspoken, and reveal what intuition already suspects.

For your case, I recommend this spread:

 The Mirror Spread – for lingering connections

This spread is specifically designed to read dynamics between two people when communication is broken, but energetic ties persist.    Card 1 – Your Heart: What you are truly feeling beneath the confusion.    Card 2 – Her Heart: What she is carrying emotionally about this connection.    Card 3 – Her Intentions: What lies behind her recent behavior (e.g. the story revisits).    Card 4 – The Thread: What still ties you together, if anything.    Card 5 – The Wall: What stands in the way.    Card 6 – What Happens Next: The trajectory of this connection, energetically or practically.    Card 7 – What You Need: Not advice, but soul medicine—what your heart most needs to hear right now.   This spread will cut through the noise of friends’ opinions and even your own spiraling questions.

The Reading:

 1. Your Heart – Queen of Wands (Reversed)

You are usually self-assured, vibrant, and intuitive—but right now, you feel disempowered. This card reversed suggests a deep insecurity, perhaps a sense of not being “seen” in your full glow. Your inner fire flickers, still burning, but it’s tangled with doubt and self-questioning. You may be fixating not just on her—but on what her silence seems to say about you.   Message: Your strength is not gone, only shaken. You are not less worthy because she doesn’t respond.    2. Her Heart – 8 of Pentacles

She’s focused on her own process—perhaps work, healing, or personal improvement. This card isn’t romantic—it’s diligent, quiet, methodical. She's in a season of effort, likely internal or practical, not emotional expression. That doesn’t mean she doesn’t feel—it means her heart is engaged elsewhere.   Message: Her energy is not centered on this connection right now. It’s not rejection—it’s preoccupation.    3. Her Intentions – Justice

She’s trying to do what she believes is right or fair. This might be why she’s keeping distance yet still watching. She’s weighing consequences, not acting impulsively. There’s a sense of guilt, karma, or moral responsibility—perhaps not wanting to lead you on, or trying to maintain some kind of internal balance.   Message: Her revisits are not games—they come from a place of reflection, but not of readiness.    4. The Thread – The Magician

You had real connection—emotional, maybe even spiritual. There was mutual creation, desire, spark. The magician speaks to potential and chemistry: something was manifesting between you. This thread lingers. The energy is real. But a magician alone cannot conjure with a silent audience.   Message: The connection had life. Whether it still does depends not just on what’s left, but what both of you are willing to create.    5. The Wall – 5 of Swords (Reversed)

A past conflict—perhaps that honest conversation—left wounds, shame, or discomfort. Reversed, this card suggests both parties want peace, but don’t know how to reach it. Pride, fear of vulnerability, or the fear of being misunderstood again are blocking resolution.   Message: There’s no battle now—but the memory of one lingers, keeping both of you guarded.    6. What Happens Next – The Empress

This is tender. The Empress suggests something nurturing, abundant, emotional, feminine in nature is coming. It could be a softening—within you, around you, or from her. Not necessarily a reunion, but the return of gentleness. Self-love is emphasized. There’s potential for growth—but it may not be in the direction you expect.   Message: Whatever happens next will feed your heart—but not in the way obsession starves it. Think healing over outcome.    7. What You Need – 4 of Pentacles (Reversed)

Let go. Not necessarily of her—but of control, of trying to decipher every sign, of gripping the past with white knuckles. This card inverted urges you to loosen your hold—not on love, but on fear. On the fear that it meant nothing, or that if you stop holding on, it disappears completely.   Message: You don’t need answers—you need release. Free yourself from the idea that you must do something right now. Let space breathe through this.    Final Reflection

This connection did matter. She still feels something—but it’s locked beneath layers of duty, focus, and distance. Her watching your stories is a symptom of unfinished feeling, not a sign of present commitment. You are not imagining things—but you are at risk of mistaking static for signal.

You are worthy of more than ambiguity. The Empress promises a return to fullness—whether from her or within yourself. That’s where your energy belongs now.

 Come on, don't leave me, it can't be that easy, babeIf you believe me, I guese I'll get on a planeFly to your city excited to see your faceHold me, console me, and then I'll leave without a trace  —No One Noticed. The Marías  It is getting more and more common for me to come back home in the late hours of the night and not even try to write. Do I even like doing this? Is there an use to recording and narrating what happens to me and how it affects me?

The website where I write this gives me the opportunity of mending up skipped days by writing twice as much. One thousand five hundred words. How many emotions can fit in fifteen hundred words? Do I even feel that much after the chemical calmness from my medication?

Yesterday, sitting right here, on the white and uncomfortable desk chair that I got when I furnished this apartment, while I waited for Fabiola to sign on on Zoom and start the session. Last session, after asking me about the concert, she proposed giving a pause to the theme of Clara . Stop looking for meaning in there. I sipped on my coffee and took a bite to the granola bar that would serve as my breakfast while I tried—unsuccessfully—to think back to what had happened the week before.

As I mentioned to her today, just the day before it had been one of those days where I fight with my depression pushing me down the bed and forbidding me from living and lose. I lost until the early evening, too late to meet with Aliza for the plans we had to meet at La graine brûlée.

In the fifteen minutes that I waited for her—secretly hoping that clock's hand would arrive to that quarter mark before she appeared; not unlike when I was a teenager and would expect the professor to miss a similar deadline before the class was deemed cancelled—I did not remember nor thought back about the events of that day before.  Alda > Do you want to do smth today after ur therapy?

Sofélia > honestly i don’t, but i prob should   While I showered and got ready, Sonny and Alda figured out the details about our improptu day outside. They found this place—a café, they thought—with an amazing view of the city up from the 45th floor of Place Ville Maria. When Alda shared the details with me, she added how it closes at 16h and opens up again at 17h; we could set the latter as our rendez-vous time. Afterwards, for dinner, we could go to Arepera. I assumed she would say yes, but still sent her a text confirming it would be fine if I invited Majo.

María reached back fairly quickly saying she had a patient that day, but maybe she could join us for the dinner portion of our plans. We agreed that I would update her on our location whenever she told me she was free to leave.

Sonny and I headed, still thinking it was a café, left my apartment with plenty of time before the agreed 17h. I do not remember if we took the 30 bus outside my house. Probably not, since I have half-memories of recognizing our way back to Bonaventura station later that evening.

As we got to the fancy tower and I explored our way up, I felt a strange sense of dejà vu. Then I remembered two years ago when I traversed a similar path upstairs somewhere towards an expensive brunch place for Aliza's birthday.

I figured out our way without many issues. When we made it to the final floor, I approached one of the two ends hidden behind black curtains and someone came out of them.

— On cherche Soren 45.

— Vous l'avez trouvé. Deux personnes ?

— Non, trois personnes.

— Suivez-moi.

The host grabbed three menus and led us to a bar by one of the windows. Without opening the menus, I figured out the place was going to be one of those terrases with inflated prices that are definitely not worth it. To further justify my annoyance, on the whole menu there were but two items without alcohol. The first one was a mocktail containing strawberries, cherries, and some other fruits that I cannot tolerate. The second was a matcha cream with honey. Sonny noticed my frustration and said she would pay for mine. Her glass of wine ended up being cheaper than my tiny glass of seaweed-tasting green tea.

Our drinks arrived before Alda. She had a much harder time than me finding her way to the place. After a a series of texts, a video call, and me heading outside the curtain to bring her to our bar, she made it. She brought with her a box of lebanese sweets for me and Sonny. I forgot now what was the name of the cocktail she got for herself.

Majo texted me around 18h, that she was ready to leave. We considered meeting at la arepera, but decided instead to meet at the bottom of the tower. By the time we got our bills, paid, headed down, and found a restroom on the way to the metro, I realized it would be better to meet at Sherbrooke and just walk together to the Venezuelan place.

We got first to the familiar metro station. While we waited for our fourth companion, I took two long-exposure photographs of the trains in both direction arriving to the platform.

The walk towards Arepera felt much shorter than it really was. We sat down and ordered our food. I got myself a vegan one with plantain, beans and avocado. It was not as good is I was expecting it to be.

I had told both Sonny and Alda before. I did not tell Fabiola today. When Majo asked me if Clara had texted, I said no, but that she would soon. Then I gave her the full context for my last message.

Yesterday, browsing Instagram, I saw a post from Cinéma Moderne for a series of short films made by Québécois newcomer directors. I proposed Sonny to go see them. I went into their website to read more information and buy the tickets. It was somewhere on the way there, that I got the promotion of a new date for the 4K screening of Princess Mononoke. A mixture of curiosity and hope pushed me to click on the button that led me to find an almost-full theatre available for it. It was the same Tuesday, but a couple of hours after. I did not buy the tickets for the short films, not yet.  Soffiafdz > hey! i just saw there’s another 4k screening of princess mononoke next tuesday at 21h15. thought of you, would you still want to go?   I sent the text Tuesday, a week before of the screening, at almost precisely 16h. That day, not only did she not come back to review the stories I posted, she did not even see the ones of that evening at all before I went to bed.

Sitting down at Arepera, after finishing our food, right when Majo was sharing her latest development with Seline, I grabbed my phone and looked myself in the camera app. My hair looked particularly good that day. I stopped listening when I pressed the record button and saved a clip of around 10 seconds of me looking directly at the camera, slowly moving my head to show off the curls that have been slowly growing this year. That was the first video that Clara did not watch.

We did not have the baby talk until Else's.

Leaving the restaurant, I walked towards the new stands by their corner offering their different types of flour. Among the bags, there was a single black beanie. The price tag was illegible, so we asked for it. When it turned out to be, in fact, 10 CAD, I bought it to Sonny.

We were walking back through Prince-Arthur, when we passed by a brewery, and someone, probably Alda, mentioned they could use a drink. Even though I had no plans of drinking, I grabbed to that opportunity and held on to it. We almost went inside it, but its size and lack of appropriate seating dissuaded some of us. I remembered Else's and proposed it as a viable alternative.

We got there and, from outside we could see that the bar was completely full. Thankfully, Alda had the initiative to go inside and ask. The waiters told her that one table would be available between maybe five and ten minutes. We decided to wait.

As promised, less than 15 minutes of waiting between the two doors of the entrance, we got a table in the louder than expected bar. We ordered our drinks and continued with our conversations. Not unlike before with Seline's subject, I dissasociated for a significant portion of what Majo was sharing about her motherhood conflict born out of her PhD project. It was the very last sentence that brought me in, when she said that she was admitting it now: she wanted a baby.

Little by little, the plan started forming. It might have been me who put everything in motion, when I asked Majo, directly, "what are you going to do about it?"

She told us how she definitely would not do it alone—she needed a partner; without it, there was no way she would do anything.

"Does it have to be a partner?", I pushed again. "I mean, a romantic partner?"

When she said no, then it was when everything started. Queer motherhood. The bond of friendship. IVF. The four of us all getting together to raise a single baby. Where to live; what language to teach—what language to learn.

I told Fabiola today, in our rescheduled session, how I never got sure about how serious they were. Everyone makes this kind of silly plans. If neither of us gets married by when we are 35, let's marry each other. Even I had made one of those with Paty.

But the anxiety and the fear that the conversation awoke in me, those felt serious and real.

Alda ended up being who volunteered to carry the baby. Majo had no desire for the baby to carry her DNA. Sonny did, but she could compromise. I held onto my chair hoping that nobody would think about it and mention it, I felt a sort of appreciation that if they had thought about it they decided not to bring it up.

"Do you want it to have yours?" finally did ask Alda, looking straight at me. Despite being drowned in the loud conversations of the whole bar, I heard the question loud and clear.

"I don't know."



### Thursday, April 24th, 2025

"What is going on?"

"Nothing. I just remembered too much."  A couple of minutes ago, I opened up the Instagram app on my phone. I went to the search button and went to the Cinéma Moderne account. Sonny and I already have our tickets for next Tuesday series of short films. I clicked on the cinéma's linktree. On their specific site with different buttons for their showings, I scrolled down, already familiar with it, until I got to the one for Princess Mononoke. With a touch, I asked it to show me its screening dates. I selected the one for Tuesday night. I do not think I felt relief when I saw still several available seats. I did not feel content with the fact that most of them were on the edges of the rows. It was the first movie we saw on our third date, when Clara told me she prefers seating by the end of the row—easy access to the exits. I might have felt disappointed if all seats were gone, or there were not two adjacent ones. She still has not opened the message from two days ago inviting her to join me.

I cannot fathom how she can go days without seeing what I had to say. How can she feel the need to revisit my profile and see again the 24h photos or videos I posted, but not read the words that I specifically wrote for her? She must have seen it—probably the same day it arrived, from the notification that comes with it. She probably saw that it was yet another effort from my end to keep whatever it is that is between us alive. She must be too busy to have to think of what to reply; how to get out of it, how to say no, without hurting me—or maybe just to figure out if she wants to see me at all.  All week I have been waiting for an email from Louis. Unsure whether Monday or Tuesday would be his return from the week off, I kept logging on looking for his name on my inbox every morning. Today is the day of the week when we have our weekly meetings. If there was going to be a day to hear from him, it was going to be today.

Last night, I could not fall asleep. I spent a couple of hours after midnight conversing with chatGPT about my insecurities as both a writer or a photographer. Afterwards, I used the artificial intelligence to help me figure out the details of the best approach for creating a personal website.  Sonny and I got out of bed after noon. I brewed coffee and cooked breakfast. Around 13h-14h, Louis sent me an email asking how I was doing and giving me the option of have our meeting or not. Salut Sofia. How goes?   Sofía Fernández > Hi, Louis

Still a bit rough on the edges, but getting there.   I took his offer to skip today's meeting—I felt too embarrased to confess to him that more than a week has passed since he sent me back all the documents ready to resubmit my manuscript and I have not yet done it.

We settle on touching base some time next week. I hope by then I have finished the 15 minutes task that, for some reaosn, I keep postponing.  After eating, one of the times I went into the restroom, I was too aware of my own smell. It took me a moment to think back of the last time that I showered. It had been two days that I had been wearing the same white tank top.

Since I was going to shower, I proposed Sonny to do something, go somewhere. She had been mentioning going to Mount Royal since she arrived. The high temperature outside made it a good occasion for doing to today.

I put one of the pair of pants that I bought recently, the last time I went to develop pictures.

After the mini-hike and climbing the countless flights of stairs to get up to the view from the Chalet, it rained on us for 5 minutes. I posted a short 10-second video on IG.

We continued our walk towards the small Lac aux castors, where we set camp, sat down and read for a bit. Clara opened the story—but not the message—around 30 minutes after I posted, before I uploaded a follow-up picture that Sonny took of me. She saw that one not much later. We stayed there until we made use of the golden hour to increase the small number on the counter of my canon half-35 camera.

We walked off the park and took the 144 bus to Thomson house, where we had dinner.

### Friday, April 25th, 2025

 My language is the last thing I give.

I live all my days in languages that are not mine.

One is the language of daily life and strangers;broken, foreign soundsmy mouth still stumbles to pronounce;spoken only to the anonymous peoplewhose faces are not meant to be remembered.

Another, more familiar but still not mine:the language of closeness without intimacy.I work in it, make friends, fall for people I barely know.To myself, I write in its words these poems;I whisper in its sounds quiet ideas meant for no one else.

But mine—the one I called out for my mother in when I woke up crying;the one I sang to my teddy bears in;the one that carried my father’s first ‘I’m proud of you';the one I learned to lie in;the one I would pray in after I stopped believing in God;the one I broke my heart in before I knew what love was—its music has to be earned.

There are more nights I’ve given my bodythan nights I’ve whispered Te quiero.I save my language for those who have known meand decided to stay.   I went inside my dark room to fish my bottle and box of medications. I might take them now at 22h30, despite barely starting to write. I have two days left before I have to give myself my next injection. I might increase the dose a little bit to completely forego the midnight erections.

I just swallowed my dreams in pill-form. I have around 30 minutes before they take effect if this is one of the nights they work.

My mum has been texting me almost every day. Right now there are still a couple of messages in blue bubbles that I have not yet addressed. She started the conversation asking about the picture that I uploaded yesterday at the top of the city's mountain: I looked very good in those pants—the pants that I bought maybe a week ago from the Indian place, precisely because they reminded me to the clothes that Helena was wearing during our day in Braga; she used to carry an old film camera in a leather harness, it hangs from her neck in one of the pictures that I took of her hopping on the sea. Yesterday that my mother saw that picture, within the app she sent me a message asking me if I am eating well. This morning I weighted myself and I gained a kilogram from the last time that I stepped over the scale.

Today I did shower and we did go outside. Before going to bed last night, Sonny had proposed we went to Oui mais non. In the morning—more precisely the afternoon since, like all week, we did not get up until midday—I brewed coffee, but we decided not to eat breakfast. We headed outside to the café, but before turning right on Jarry, a sudden change of plans led us to Café Velours. On our way I might have mentioned that the last time I had been there was the day of the concert when I met with Sarah. I purposefully kept to myself that the previous time had been with Clara, even when we were standing, waiting, on the same bus stop where we did not kiss.

I finished the roll that I put in last week inside the basement of the café. There was a woman who was waiting for the bus next to us. When the three of us got inside the train, Sonny went to the back corner of the vehicle, the nameless brunette with the long white coat sat in the row in front of me, a couple of seats to my left, right besides the back doors. I brought my camera out of the backpack that was resting on my lap. I covered my face with it, swallowed my vouyeristic urges, and rather than shoot at her, aimed the lens to my right. When I was about to pulled the trigger, my camera jammed: the roll was finished.

We got out a block before Le studio argentique. I approached the counter, but the man behind it was busy with another costumer. When it was my turned, I greeted him in French and asked him for a roll of Harman Phoenix. We answered and continued our interaction in English.

We walked back towards Sherbrooke before we got to Photo St-Denis. Sonny told me to go inside without her. I left the roll that I had just taken out of the camera and picked up the developed negatives that were waiting for me.

We finished our evening at the library. I picked up the poetry book that was waiting for me on the back of the ground floor. We took the elevator to the third floor where we sat down on the chairs by the large windows and I completed the book that was almost-finished from the reading throughout the day inside the café and our bus trips.

The message I sent Clara early this week remains unseen. I doubt she will acknowledge it before midnight. I will probably get a response during the weekend. I am aware of the possibility that she is waiting until after the night of the movie before opening it.

### Saturday, April 26th, 2025

  De qué me sirven las palabrassi no hay nadanada que escribirmurmurarni gritarque apague estoque me arde adentro.    I am now hoarding drafts of poems and photographs that I dare not to share.

How can at the same time exist both the hunger of being seen and the hesitance of being exposed?

I dreamed something. Monica was there. We were lying down on a couch. Or maybe it was a bed. I wanted to be even closer to her. She told me about her kid and I listened. I do not remember anything else.

I cannot say exactly if the email from the Photolab came before or after the notification from Clara's message. I waited for both, but I expected just one of them.

I convinced Sonny to get out of bed with the promise of coffee. I set to download the compressed directory of the +70 photographs into my iPad as the timer held the pace of the dripping coffee from the V60 onto the plastic carafe.

We were sitting on the couch, persuading my television to connect to my tablet and show us the photographs I was excited to see, when I got the notification. I did not open it. The message was legible from the little window and I read it just as Clara must have done almost a week ago when she first got my invitation.  clarabelais > Hey! Sadly it’s a bit late for me as I wake up at 5 next morning (last week of doing that)   At the moment I did not think; now I cannot help but wonder when did these words take form: were they newborn just as she opened the conversation or has she been keeping them in hear head, prepared and set for whenever she were ready to respond?

How much of a mental effort did it take her to come up with this exactly? Months ago I had noticed how the punctuation in her messages come and goes; a subtle sign of formality that gives away planning. How thought of were the other signs: the mirrorred greeting: nothing more nor less than what she got—was I expecting to see again an old petname that went away with our last kiss?; the Sadly that softens the rejection; the unasked context that my desperation reads as an invitation to not stop, to keep trying—not this time, but do not stop reaching; maybe next week.

I considered not opening the message, unsure for how long. Perhaps a couple of days just like she had done, potentially never—probably soon.

We both showered and prepared for our meeting with Alda and Veronica. The plan finished taking form this very morning. We met at Darling. Sonny and I rode the 30 bus. On our way there, we stopped to try taking a photograph of a mural a couple of blocks before the bar. The camera malfunctioned and we stayed in front of the potential subject a couple of minutes while I wrestled with the shutter mechanism of the camera I gave Sonny. By the time I won the match and took the picture, Alda was outside the bar waiting for us. We ordered food and drinks. We got our stuff before Veronica came and joined us.

Last night I posted the poem I wrote, edited, and finished together with the scan of a selfportrait from the Berlin roll I developed weeks ago. When I woke up and grabbed the phone searching for Clara in its analytics I found her. Before arriving to the bar, most probably on our ride there, I posted two following stories, the first was a regular portrait of me sitting down on my red blanket on a small hill by the lake inside Mt-Royal. The next one was a selfportrait more artistically ambitious. A glanze of me taking the picture was reflected a small vase under the stairs with Le repos written at the bottom; passing through, never meant to stay was the caption I wrote under. It was an offhand comment that Vero throw absentmindedly that made me overthink it and decide to archive it. I cannot remember whether Clara saw them before I did reply back.

I showed the evidence I saved of the notification to Alda. She proposed writing back something casual like ok, np. I said back how I was thinking of not replying and maybe even not opening at all. "Oh, OK. That is a bit cold."

Eventually, later into the evening, I opened the conversation and, not much later, wrote but two words.  soffiafdz > no worries   She has not seen it.

Before we paid our bills, I noticed she had posted a green-haloed story. I started a fight against the stubborn urge to open it and hurt myself with it.

So far, I am winning.

I lost shortly after.

I remembered Saturdays are the days Clara has her pole dance classes. My obsessive curiosity turned into a raw carnal impulse to open it. What hid behind the green halo was not her body or even her face, only a glass of something golden, beer or cidre, raised by a left hand with a long thumb nail. The caption was a reference to work—I do not remember enough to try to paraphrase it. I felt defeated and betrayed.

There was another chance: maybe later when I was already in bed or perhaps some time at early morning when I grabbed half-conscious my phone I saw another opportunity to not search for her. This time I held for most of the day.

We had plans with Aliza. I kept asking Sonny to finalize the plans with her. My excuse was my lack of mental energy, but now that I am writing it there is a suspicion that my embarrasment for keep cancelling on her might have something to do with my resistance to reach out again. From midmorning when I was not ready to get out of bed right up until we walked from the metro to the persian café, I kept thinking how I would have wanted to cancel yet another time.

Sonny posted as a story the photograph that showed Aliza while we were sitting on the table by the back of the café. She joked that it could be the cover of a magazine. Aliza agreed, saying it was a really nice picture. I had been thinking of not posting anything more these next days. Sonny tagged me as the photographer. I went to accept the collaboration. Rather than just reupload the same image that most of my contacts who know her would have seen already from her, I added a couple other shots that had the same publishable merit. Of course Sonny was the first person to see it and repost it. I just did precisely what I wanted to avoid by not posting anything by opening up the viewer's list looking a particular name. Fourteen minutes after posting the picture, Clara had already seen it.

When Sonny and I approached the café, there was a group of young adults by the entrance, paused as if they were hesitating entering. I walked through them and Sonny came behind me. The café was full of life and people. I worried that there would not be an available table for the three of us. A glimpse of relief warmed my body when we approached the back and I saw Aliza already in line to order. She had placed her stuff on the large table by the middle of the backroom, fitting to sit 6 people. Behind Sonny and I, when we were greeting and hugging Aliza, were the group of people that were at the entrance. They were looking where to sit.

A waitress approached us—or maybe it was just Aliza; I think she told the barista how she had taken the table and the other said it was alright. Not much later, another iranian women, or maybe the same one, came and asked us if we would mind taking a three-person table that had just vacated to leave the larger one to the larger group. We had no issue with this.

We all ordered our sandwiches and drinks and came back to the smaller table by one of the windows in the back. I looked behind us to a table I had sat several weeks ago. There were two women: one with long, straight golden hair, and the other with shorter, wavy brown hair. The brunnete had such a thin waist it could have fit between my two hands. They stayed at their table, just far enough from us that I could not hear their conversation and answer my wonder if they were on a date.

The table right next to us was shortly after occupied by a couple. To one end there was the guy, dark skin and even darker stubble on her face with a moustache on his upper lip; dark brown curly hair. In front of him was his date, her hair was just as curly as his, with a short haircut that emphasized her rounded locks. Her eyes were green and matched her sweater. She was wearing a long cream skirt. Below it, a glimpse of her legs above her ankles that had not been shaved in months. For some reason, I kept looking back to see her. At one point she reached across the table to the hand of his date, caressing it softly and exploring the inside of his sleeve with his fingers.

They must have left before us, as I remember seeing them stand up, grab their stuff and leave.

The three of us walked back to the same metro station. I remained in silence for most of the trip back. If Majo and Aliza remained in touch, I am sure the latter would mention how I seemed distant and sad. I drafted a poem as I sat at the table between the conversation of the soccer match of Montréal's female team and the green eyes showering with affection her date. I kept thinking of it on the metro ride home, its meaning and its birth, and could not held my tears. Sonny made no mention of it.

When I got home I went straight to bed. I had hesitated sending both this one and the one I wrote yesterday to Majo. I feared that she would react annoyed to yet another undeserved gesture towards Clara. She did not.

I told her how moments before reaching to her I deleted the instagram conversation with Clara. She said how the fact that she does not write to me helps.

I answered back with a metaphor of how I feel like the last person remaining in group chat after everyone had left—incapable of leaving and deleting it.

I showed her then an IG reel that Clara had liked. It was a woman with an unrelated song in the background. The caption read: Reminder: do not to fall in love with anyone right now because you'll lbe leaving the country soon.

At first she did not get it. I explained that the reddish picture at the bottom was the same image that I look for in the list of viewers or the one that surprises me in the unexpected notifications.  Majo > Yeah, una de mis hipótesis es que ella no te quiere querer

>Majo > `She might feel it`\
>Majo > `Pero no quiere sentirlo`

>Sofélia > `idk, if that's true, if it makes me feel better or worse`

>Majo > `Simplemente lo es`

>You are not obsessed with Clara;
>you are obsessed with the part of yourself that she exposed and left aching.

***

It was a long way home, but it did not feel like it. We first took a short bus ride from La terrassee Saint-Ambroise to Station Saint-Henri. We tapped our passes, greeted the woman behind the wheel, and headed to the back of the bus. Sonny made a comment about how she had fallen in love with the bus driver.

As we went down the escalator in the metro station I remembered how it is Daniel's station—the closest to his 4 1/2 that he fought dozens, perhaps up to a hundred applicants for it. I looked at the lights and considered taking my camera out. This morning before leaving the apartment I put the Harman Phoenix roll into the Pentax ME. By the end of the evening, after the magic hour at Saint-Henri, I had shot two thirds of the experimental film.

Alda came with us down to the to the same platform and into the same train. Alda and Sonny sat together and I took one of the lone seats by the other end. I was about to nudge Alda when I saw the inside of Lionel-Groulx through the train's windows. Before saying anything I remembered her comment back at Saint-Henri of her plan to ride the metro up to Sherbrooke and from there take the 144 bus that leaves her at her door. I rested down my hand over my thigh.

We passed Guy-Concordia without me noticing. I did not think of Sophie. Last year, after our date, we walked back toward this station. She narrated to me brief snapshots of her life as an undergrad here. Approaching the entrance, she mentioned she would now put on her mask. Perhaps already suspicious we would never see each other again, I asked if I could kiss her. Sure, she said, and pulled it down. I stepped closer and we kissed—brief, clumsy, hollow. Weeks later, after the final text and the silent weeks that preceded it, the memory of the bad kiss did nothing to soften her goodbye.

I did not think of Alexandra, either. One, or maybe two years before Sophie, concluding a two-parted first date, we circled the campus to reach the shuttle bus for the Loyola campus. She raised her hands toward her mask. With it still covering her face, it was as if the question came from her eyes—were they green? Can I kiss you? She pulled the mask down as she stepped closer. I remember the texture of the single golden curl I played with behind her neck. It would not be weeks before she left my life without a goodbye.

Around there must have been where Alda let us know about her change of mind. She decided to get off at Lucien-L'Allier and walk the 20 minutes to her apartment. Hours earlier, at the brasserie, she shared out-load her excitement for sleeping on her bed again. Last night, after watching the Last of Us, she asked to sleep on my couch. By the point she got off the train we had spent 24H the three of us. As soon as the doors closed behind her back Sonny waved at me to join her on the then empty seat beside her.

There was a man standing by the door to my left. I kept glancing at him. I saw his recently cut short blonde hair; like his well-kept beard, it had a reddish tint. He was wearing a navy suit made of either twill or wool. It looked as his body had been made precisely to fit on it. I could not help imagine if under the suit, the hair on his chest all the way down to his sex were as trimmed and reddishly light as the one above his neck. Despite continuously looking his way, I cannot say at which stop he got off.

I do not remember either at what stop the blonde woman got in. She was earing white pants and a cream sweatshirt with the hoodie up. Through it I noticed the ends of her straight golden hair and the emeralds in the eyes shining through her silver-pleated glasses. Never once did she look towards me, always straight ahead, her chin resting on her right hand. I noticed on it a couple of rings and wondered if she had bought all of them herself or if they were gifts. I wondered if she took them off whenever she used that hand to touch herself before falling asleep.

By Mont-Royal Sonny nudged me to ask for the reason of the station's name, why was it called like that if other stations like Guy-Concordia where much closer to the mountain. While I answered talking about the streets that cross the orange line I thought back to another evening where I had gone to Lola Rosa just like we had done earlier, sitting somewhere in the middle of the train, I lifted up my head from Clara's shoulder and she gave me a fleeting kiss on the lips like a whisper, the very last one of its kind.

Passing Rosemont, I thought back to Clara again and the very next time that I saw her and the time I kissed her. This time we were both standing, an air of melancholy between us. When the robotic voiced announced the imminent arrival to which was now her new station, I got closer and placed my hand on her cheek. Bye, I whispered. And like two more whispers I kissed her twice—aware it would be the last and begging her that it wouldn't.

Beaubien was the next stop. I got off at that station almost half a year ago and walked a couple blocks to the bar where I met her. I arrived first and got a table by the back of the bar. I put on a red dress and a full face of make-up. I remember seeing her get through the door and walked towards me without recognizing. I would never had imagined then how many nights afterward would I write here the name of the French woman that came to my end of the table to hug me before taking her brown leather jacket, sitting across me and pass the next 6h of the night talking, laughing with me and exchanging secrets.

Around a month later, she walked me back to the entrance of that same metro station. I might have noticed how she carried with her the urge to bring back one of the two secrets that I offered her that night for free. You said something about kissing me, she murmured into the night, a shy and bold invitation to our first kiss.

Passing Jean-Talon, I wondered: if I succeed in my goal of not reaching out, will I ever hear from her again?

Will the memories of her whispered kisses, tasting of promises or goodbye, come to feel the same as those of Sophie and Alexandra?

Finally, at Jarry, our station, Sonny and I step off the train and walked home.

> "You look happier"
>
>Thanks I stopped dating


I had to get out of bed. Sonny heard me crying. She rubbed my back, gently. I startled. Earlier today I begged her again not to touch me. I feel like my body screams, I tried to explain. She did not get it. I tried and failed to contain my quiet sobs.

"¿Con quien hablas?"

She was talking with someone on the phone when I went to join her on my bed. Had I seen the liked reel by then or was it after I had set the alarm to get up tomorrow morning?

I did not answer her. She guessed chatGPT while the notifications from Majo kept showing up on my screen. She was not necessarily wrong.

I got out from the bed and my room. I went to the bathroom. Before sitting down on the toilet and cleaning my face I looked straight at myself on the mirror.

You are 32. Why are you crying about this? How can you be so hurt for this nonsense?

I came out to the living room. I did not want to turn on the lights. I grabbed my laptop and started writing, even though I cannot see without my glasses and the tears drowning my eyes.

At the Cinéma Sonny posted a photography of the theater before it got full by the other expectators. I asked her to tag me so I could post it myself, betraying yesterday's intent of stopping setting baits. I was not quick enough to upload it before the start of the shorts. By the time the films ended, it was the time that I had decided I would pick up the sharing of the series of self-portraits. Hours later, after having dinner, sorting out the expenses of the past weeks, and even washing the dishes while Sonny was already lying on bed talking on the phone with somebody, I grabbed my phone and looked at the people who had seen the two pictures. Clara was at the top. I reopenned that old note where I had recorded the time of her visits with the intention of catching her on her returns.

It was 23h30 when she showed up. The first thought I had was her reason for rejecting my invitation for the movie this evening was that it was too late. I then reconsidered and judged myself for my unfairness. Perhaps she had put off opening the orange circle surrounding my own portrait on her screen as much as possible, up to her being in her own bed ready to fall asleep.

That was how I was when I clicked on the reels tab. I saw her orange-tinted picture that by now has been ingrained in a specific part of the back of my mind at the top right corner on the small button that invites me to browse what my contacts have seen and liked. The first video was one liked by Paty. It was of a man pasting a phrase on a telephone pole. An open question whether the writer and their object have coincided in thinking of each other. I swiped down and then I saw the vide of the woman hopping on the beach with the caption above about being happier after stopping dating.

The background music on loop went over and over as I reread the white letters and looked down to the orange circle I have memorised. She stopped. She was dating and now she has stopped. She implied it several times, she did not date much besides me. And now she stopped. She stopped me and now she is happier.

I swiped down to escape from it—not just once, but a handful of times. Something pulled me back. I saw the picture and considered clicking on it, opening up the box where I could write a message that would be delivered right to her bed, nudge her to sleep even if she were to ignore it and pretend she did not see it. I tried to find the right words, sharp enough they could cut her fingers as she opened the message; I wanted her to bleed just like how I felt I was bleeding from inside.

I sent the image to Majo.  Majo > Tú también te sientes así

> Majo > You hate dating

She was right. I even said it when Clara and I met. Since you hate first dates so much we can skip it since we technically almost had one already. But that was why I liked her so much, because she was the exception. Written on one of the notes we exchanged back in December, she made dating enjoyable.

Sofélia > no quiero volver a pasar por esto

> Majo > Salir con alguien?

I did not answer and Majo started telling me about this couple that sat with her and her supervisor. They had been married for over 20 years. All throughout the dinner the kept complaining about each other. All this time, they complained as they held hands. Majo's supervisor said she saw them happy. Majo thought to herself that they seemed like they were together because they were supposed to.  Sofélia > tener una sola noche

querer a alguien y recibier, lo que sea que he estado recibiendo
