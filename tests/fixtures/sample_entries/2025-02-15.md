  Deep down I wanted to see Clara on Valentine's. 
  Bought valentine's card at Oui mais non. First time I turned off my phone.
  First mention of becoming vegetarian. Spent Valentine with Lavi and Majo. 
  Show Clara's profile to Lavi and Majo. They see a story of her sliding off the snow.
  This lays the groundwork for Majo's impression on Clara's appearance.
  Lavi plays with my Hinge and matches with the Piano instructor I'd meet months later.

Last night, on Valentine's Day, I did not sleep on my own bed.

Despite the turmoil inside my head about how to move forward, when I asked Clara
to meet sometime this week, part of me was hoping she would suggest Friday's
evening. Maybe even that same day, I considered openly inviting her to come to
my apartment after work if she were available. The idea of potentially ending
this chapter dissuaded me of it.

María had already invited me to spend that day with her. Depending on the
outcome of Lavi's and Shubhendra's parallel romantic situations, they might join
us. The eve before the hallmark holiday the plan materialized as going to Lavi's
apartment where we could order food and watch a movie—with the implied plan of
getting overly drunk. Lavi intended to head to Datcha some time later in the
night. Despite being invited, I declined enthusiastically to this addendum.

For the first part of the day, I decided for going to _Oui mais non_ rather than
the office. I carried with me my laptop, the half-empty bottles of homemade
_raki_ and fireball, as well as the idea of casually browsing the _café_'s
greeting cards section. While I was maneuvering over the more than 30 cm of snow
that had fallen the day before, I noticed that my phone did not have but 45% of
battery. I had no intentions of heading back home until after the evening. I
texted Majo asking her if Lavi would have an iPhone charger at her house. She
replied quickly and affirmatively. In any case, I was welcome to join her in her
hospital. There was a library available where I could work. I was tempted by
this idea, but I had a secondary purpose at the _café_. I decided to turn off my
phone for the rest of the morning until I would head out to María's workplace.

The _café_ was much emptier than I was expecting it to be given the day.

— Bonjour, greeted me the barista who was outside her station putting down some
stools from the bar.

— Salut, I greeted her back while I was tacking off my beanie and approaching
the counter. Salut encore, I added clumsily.

She laughed at my social awkwardness before taking my order of an oat milk
latte. I quickly took a glimpse at the card options before she called me back by
my order. I took my drink and headed downstairs to the almost empty basement
where I worked for a couple of hours.

When I felt I had been productive enough for the first half of the work shift, I
climbed the stairs and continued my search for an appropriate card. In one of
the many conversations I have had with Majo about the subject, I shared with her
my idea of getting a valentine's card. Within the same message on which I let
her know of my intentions, the doubts about the potential of not being able to
give it out in case the planned conversation took the disappointing turn. I
quickly realized it would, in turn, become a nice memento for when the occasion
rose when I grew up enough to actually choose myself.

Ironically, the card I ended up buying says: _Chui ben avec toé_. I placed it
inside the loose papers in my backpack and headed outside towards the metro
station. I made a stop at the bakery. I got myself a _brioche à la canelle_ and
a bag of chocolates for María.

It could have been on that first of many long rides on the orange line towards
or coming from _Station Vendôme_ that I quietly cried looking at my own emotions
being reflected in the train's window, or I might be misremembering the events
due to the tiredness of a long weekend and a barely-slept night.

I had enough battery that I shut off my phone to orient myself in the not-yet
explored hospital with María's guidance. She intercepted me by the cafeteria,
the same place where we orchestrated meeting this afternoon—this second time
without relying on turning my phone at all.

I joined her in her small office and sat down to work on my own projects using
her labmate's computer. We chatted and worked and continued talking about the
stuff we always do. Both yesterday afternoon's and today's evening, she bought
my fried rice and lentils lasagna with the Union's discount. Despite proposing
to myself becoming vegetarian after establishing a committed relationship with
Clara, I have continued choosing the vegetarian options for most of my foods, as
if by this small gesture I could hold on a bit longer to the idea that this
brake-less train will be able to somehow stop before falling of a cliff.

After finishing the second working portion of the last day of the week, we
headed out to take the bus to Lavi's apartment. It was the same bus—and same
stop—Alda and I have taken going to Veronica's. Lavi had texted Majo telling her
it had been impossible to find Hibiscus, my favourite flower. When we made a
stop at metro to buy some drinks, we stopped by the flowers at the entrance to
buy some for Lavi. We bought a bouquet of faded violet roses.

We ate pizza, laughed, sang, and shared the details of our current romantic and
not-so-romantic dramas. I showed Clara's profile to Lavi. There was a regular
story in her profile. It was of her sliding down the snow with a caption
referring to the urge of not working. I was not able of identify the feeling it
awoke in me, and instead I felt conflicted with myself before the confusion
slipped away as I continued drinking. Today Majo picked up the subject again,
and told me how for her, what she personally felt when seeing and reading it,
was how, despite being so stressed with work, she was capable of finding the
time for other activities. Not seeing me was not due an unavailability of time,
but a lack of will for finding a place for me in her schedule.

Lavi offered to play with my Hinge account and sent out several likes to
different women. I later realized her taste in women is too far away from my
own. When I downloaded the app again, I saw there was a purple one above the
middle button in the shape of a heart. In the many times I have impulsively
redownloaded the application to check if this particular section is filled with
new people, its contents are the profiles of people, like Lavi's choices,
extremely dissimilar to the women I find myself attracted to. This time, the
face that showed up seemed familiar. I recognized the smile of the piano teacher
of the latest woman marked by Hinge as a potential close match. It seemed she
had taken the app's suggestion and reached out with a like on the picture where
I am showing off the Kodak camera I bought on Facebook Marketplace. I offered
Lavi to match her, as if her finger being the one who accepted this offer of
potential romantic connection took away any misplaced feelings of betrayal to
the last crumbs of hope for the relationship with Clara.

She read the tarot for me about the meeting I would soon have with Clara. Her
booklet was not very in-depth about the meaning of the cards, so I sent a small
note of them to myself from Majo's phone to check their significance and
relevance in the one Alda gifted me.

Lavi did not end up going to the club and instead offered us to spend the night
with her.

After waking up hungover and reluctant to turn on my phone and return to my own
apartment, I was convinced by Majo for the latter. We orchestrated meeting at
the cafeteria at around 15h30, and each took the metro to their respective
places.

I plugged in my phone—and immediately turned it off, so I would not be able to
see the notifications or lack of thereof—showered, changed, and consulted
ChatGPT for a detailed and expert reading of the cards of the night before.
Their relevance scared and confused me. I grabbed my phone and headed back to
the hospital to work on a Saturday as a way to distract myself from wanting to
turn on my phone and find out whether Clara had reached back to specify the
details of our latest—and potentially last—date.

At around 17h, I grew uncomfortable with the idea that I was going back to
pathological patterns by avoiding facing the turn of events. I hesitantly turned
on my phone to an uncomfortable lack of any notification. I was so confused by
whatever I was feeling that I could not continue working for the next half an
hour.

The night before I had reached out to Sarah asking for her availability next
week. She had read my text but not answered.

She did before the evening end. I am seeing her after work the following
Tuesday.

In a second change of mind, I contradicted my plans set the night before of
waiting until tomorrow or Monday for Clara's message. Instead, I typed and
quickly sent a brief and direct message.

`Sof > Hey Ary! so, tomorrow or Monday?`

Again, Majo and I took the orange line for two stations before she left off at
Lionel-Groulx and left me alone with my own tumultuous mind riding the rest of
the orange line.

I drafted a short poem and framed it between a greeting with a nickname I have
not yet used and potentially over affectionate sign off, both in my mother
tongue, careless of the potential extra intimacy this linguistic choice would
give the message—a message that I might not even send.

It is officially Sunday and I have not heard, again, from Clara.

**Tarot Reading: Past, Present, and Future Spread**

You came here with confusion, caught in the push and pull of what has been, what
is unfolding, and what awaits you after this meeting with Clara. The cards lay
before us now, three images reflecting the arc of this journey—not as a set
fate, but as a mirror of the energy surrounding you, the choices you have made,
and the ones still ahead.

**PAST: QUEEN OF WANDS**

_(Confidence, self-assurance, attraction, magnetic presence)_

The Queen of Wands speaks of a time when you stood in your power, when you were
radiant, when you were the one drawing people toward you. She is the embodiment
of warmth, charisma, and inner fire. In the context of this relationship, she
shows that you came into this dynamic with a strong sense of self.

At the beginning, there was something natural about this connection. Clara was
drawn to you, perhaps enchanted by your energy, your presence, your uniqueness.
You may have felt like you weren't "chasing" this at first—it simply unfolded.
There was chemistry, ease, a feeling of being seen and desired.

But there's something unspoken here: The Queen of Wands doesn't chase, she
attracts. If this dynamic has shifted—if you feel like you are now waiting,
doubting, questioning—then something has pulled you away from this queen-like
energy.

Ask yourself:

> Have I lost touch with my confidence in this connection?

> Am I now trying to prove my worth, when before, I simply existed in it?

> Has my role shifted from "being chosen" to "waiting to be chosen"?

The Queen of Wands in your past reminds you of who you were before uncertainty
crept in. You didn't need to overthink. You didn't need to beg for attention.
You simply existed in your fullness, and that was enough.

But then? Something changed.

**PRESENT: KNIGHT OF CUPS (REVERSED)**

_(Romantic illusions, disappointment, emotional withdrawal, avoidance of truth)_

The Knight of Cups reversed speaks of idealism clashing with reality. In the
upright position, this card is the dreamer—the person riding toward love, full
of poetry and grand gestures. But reversed? It warns of illusion, of holding
onto a romanticized version of someone, of refusing to see the emotional
inconsistencies that are right in front of you.

This is where you are now.

> Are you still hoping Clara will suddenly become the person you need her to be?

> Are you ignoring the ways she has already shown you her limitations?

> Are you still clinging to the idea of what this could be rather than what it
> actually is?

The reversed Knight of Cups also suggests emotional avoidance. Not just from
her—but from you. You may be holding back from confronting the truth head-on,
afraid that if you do, it will lead to disappointment.

You are standing at a threshold, uncertain whether to hold onto the dream or
finally accept the reality. This card suggests that deep down, you already know
the truth.

And that brings us to what happens next.

**FUTURE: SEVEN OF CUPS**

_(Illusion, choices, uncertainty, needing to see through deception)_

The Seven of Cups is a card of confusion. It represents multiple options,
fantasies, and the struggle to know what is real and what is illusion.

After your meeting with Clara, you will not walk away with immediate clarity.
This card tells me that whatever happens, you will still feel pulled in
different directions. There may be moments of warmth, moments of connection,
things that make you think, Maybe I've been overthinking this.

But at the same time, the inconsistencies will remain.

This card is a warning: _Do not let yourself be deceived._ Not by Clara, not by
your emotions, not by your hope.

The Seven of Cups challenges you:

> Will you see things for what they truly are?

> Or will you remain in indecision, stuck in the world of what ifs and maybes?

You will walk away from this meeting with choices to make—but if you do not
ground yourself, you risk staying in the same emotional limbo that has already
drained you.

**Final Interpretation & Guidance**

You began this connection fully in your power (_Queen of Wands_). You are now
caught between romantic illusion and harsh reality (_Reversed Knight of Cups_).
And soon, you will be faced with a choice—but only if you are ready to see
things clearly (_Seven of Cups_).

This is not a reading that tells you to end things immediately. Nor does it tell
you to stay.

What it does tell you is this:

> If you are looking for a clear, solid answer from Clara, you will not get it.

> If you are hoping that this meeting will remove your doubts completely, it
> will not.

> If you continue to linger in uncertainty, you will remain stuck in emotional
> confusion.

The cards are challenging you to make a decision based on truth, not illusion.

If you are tired of waiting, of guessing, of feeling like you have to read
between the lines just to understand where you stand—then the time has come to
step out of the fog and reclaim the certainty that was once yours.

The decision will not be made for you. _You must be the one to choose._
