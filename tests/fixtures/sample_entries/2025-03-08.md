  Ya dime si quieres estar conmigo o si mejor me voy.
  Tus besos dicen que tú sí me quieres, pero tus palabras no.
  Y, al chile, yo hasta moriría por ti, pero dices que no.
  No eres directa, neta, ya me estás cansando; sé concreta, por favor.

Unexpectedly, the main question of the night turned out to be whether to write
or not to write.

I decided not to write in here. Instead, I went to bed.

I do not remember how the day started.

Going to the library was at the top of the plans for the day. Online, the
conclusion of my research, stated it was forbidden to drink or eat at the BAnQ.
That should have led me to drink my coffee at home; perhaps I spent some of the
morning working at my own computer.

I did end up going outside. I grabbed my stuff and headed out. Coming out, as I
stepped off the entrance of my building, the faint image of the lettering up top
the 30 bus appeared far ahead into the street. I hopped briskly towards the bus
stop just a couple meters ahead. Midway, I raised my left hand, signaling the
bus driver of my intentions. I caught the bus and rode it until the library,
around 30 slow bus stops on the way.

The tables at the BAnQ were mostly full. This time, rather than the stairs, I
used the elevator to climb to the highest floor. I found one on the very end of
building, where I put my stuff and sat down to work.

The plan was to have dinner at the Glen's cafeteria. María would text me
whenever I could go join her. It was around 16h30 when she sent the green light.
I asked for a couple more minutes to finish whatever I was doing. Earlier that
morning, Reza emailed us offering himself to turn off and unplug our computers
due to the generator tests this morning. He was going to leave at around 17h30.
There was that deadline in my head, given I knew I would probably not go to the
office this weekend to turn it back on.

I remember now how my day started. I grabbed the phone and looked at the story I
had posted for my newborn close friends group. It might have been around the 12h
mark, maybe a bit more. I've forgotten the number of spectators, but Clara was
at the top, just below those who had reacted to them. I did not mention this to
Majo until we were leaving the hospital much later in the day. As I talked then
during our metro ride home, my feelings about it were mixed. The night before,
as I was writing this, I kept checking that list hoping to see her name among
them. But what difference would it make? It was not as if I expected that image
to push her to come out of her silent exile from my life. As I could have
predicted had I given it more reflection, when I did see her name and reddish
portrait, there was no sense of relief nor accomplishment. I had proof she still
remembers I exist, but nothing more. It was not even a sign of active search, as
I had reflected many years ago with Kate, how you can swipe mindlessly through
the stories Instagram throws at you without necessarily giving them any
attention.

I walked to the RI. María came to the entrance to let me in. She had suggested
me to wait for her at the cafeteria, but then asked me if I wanted instead to
leave my stuff at her office. We ended up doing that.

Both food options for Union at the cafeteria included meat. Previously, I had
dropped my vegetarian intentions for the event of a cheap meal. This time
instead, I opted to grab a larger portion of soup and the small coffee. Majo
chose the chicken fried rice, but ended up leaving most of it. I pushed away the
chicken pieces I could find and ate her carrots.

During dinner, we talked about her latest annoyances with her labmates. Seline
and Shub ambushing her by inviting a _persona non-grata_ behind her back to an
Indian dinner. She keeps avoiding Lavi's calls. A couple of days before she told
me about Joseph, the Filipino postdoc in her lab.

Just typing the word postdoc brought me a cold shudder, born in my stomach and
crawling all through my spine. Next month I will be hearing about the results of
my funds application. Deep down I know the most probable outcome is going to be
a rejection. My publications are few and irrelevant. While the proposal is
sound, the methods might be either too complicated—as it was the case in
Louis'—or too basic to warrant a 3-year support like Mahsa observed.

I am halfly expecting to be rejected. It's as if I convince myself
disappointment is the most likely outcome, I can prepare myself to stand more
readily the blow. My plans all surround the less desirable outcome. To get out
the publications that are in the way, to continue my production of studies that
are the base of what I had proposed, to reach out to Louis talking about the
possibility of moving to France, after the end of the year under Sylvia's
supervision. Even to justify my lack of searching for a new apartment in Verdun,
all of this depends on me not getting what I want.

It might have been a bit before we left the hospital that I told her about
posting the picture of the tables inside the brewery in NYC and the heartfelt
confession about feeling tempted to head back to Instagram and the dilemma of
whether this false sense of connection was enough to betray my own values. I
told her I considered taking Clara out of the selected group of people the image
would reach. I ignore how conscious I was about the falsehood of that idea and
about the real intention of posting something in there that would get to her;
not only that, but something that would show as a green circle, something
accompanied by this symbolic promotion to a special status of acquaintance, of
closeness.

Would she wonder, as I did back in December, how long ago and for what reasons,
did I choose her to be in this group?

On the metro ride I stated how there was no perfect outcome I could imagine,
much less hope for. Even the almost impossible idea of her reaching out, saying
_I miss you, I am sorry, I want you_, would not be relieving. They would be
tainted by the realization that this can never work. So, what did I want? Did I
prefer the silence that would seal our last goodbye? Or maybe I wanted a
rejection text, something like Sophie's or Bea's resurrection with a half-truth
explanation of why she is deciding not to see me again?

In the past week since I had sent that last message, I thought about reaching
out asking about the logistics of the concert, to buy the print she would ever
make of our double-exposures, to get back the negatives I gave her, used or not.
Last morning, I woke up and thought about sending _if this is your way of saying
goodbye, it is really painful. I think I deserve better_.

María and I got to Jarry. We stepped off the metro station and made our first
stop at SAQ. I grabbed a bottle of fireball. We continued walking through Jarry
street. The second stop was the larger _dépanneur_. She grabbed the salt and
vinegar chips. I went for the can of Arizona spiked half-tea and half-lemonade.
The last and final stop was the _dépanneur_ next to my house. We bought a can of
Thai tea and a bottle of Jamaican ginger beer.

We finally entered my building. I opened the door for Majo to enter first. As I
opened the inside door, I showed her the single key I use to enter saying how we
have to make only a single copy for her. For my apartment, I opened the door and
entered in front of her. We put away the stuff we bought first. I placed my
phone face up next to the drinks, before moving on to leave the backpack on the
table and take off my coat and shoes. I was standing in the middle of the
apartment on my socks, when I saw the screen light up and unconsciously
recognized the name and/or video-camera emoji. I felt a sense of urgent anguish.
I did not know where to move or what to do.

"She just texted," I let out robotically and showed her.

Majo was as surprised as I was.

I only read the first line or two available in the notification:

> _miss you too_ \
> _sorry_ \
> _not an amazing period of time_

I desperately, and with meaningless words, tried to ask Majo to read it with me,
maybe even to read it first.

I felt lost in my own apartment.

When my senses came back to me, I sat down on the couch and I opened it.

I could see in my head the green bubble surrounding the _hey. i miss you_ that
should be above had I not deleted it that very morning.

`Clarizard > Hey,  miss you too.` \
`Sorry this is not an amazing period of time right now I hope you don't hate me too much.` \
`And that things are good despite life being life. I saw you were back on insta how do you feel?`

No name, no cute nickname; instead two white spaces.

If the message had ended halfway, I would have seen it as nothing more than an
apology for her silence. Halfly accepting blame and recognizing she must have
hurt me. Setting the reasoning for not continuing further and subtly marking an
end. But it continued.

She referenced the post I made acknowledging her presence in the list of
viewers. Perhaps, without realizing it, letting out how the reminder of my
existence was the push she needed to step out of the quietness. Like many
messages before, she ended it with a question, a gesture to continue, an
invitation to reach back.

Like many times now since I met her, I felt confused. I stated out loud we were
now going to watch the movie and not think about it. Both Majo and I were too
distracted by this unexpected turn of events to pay too much attention to the
movie I was supposed to be watching on that couch with Clara rather than her.

We did finish the movie, after many interruptions commentating both the film and
Clara's message. Majo did not like either.

After we finished it, Majo suggested we ask the tarot deck that Alda gave me for
signs about whether I should reply or not. Like last time, I used ChatGPT as a
reference of how to read the cards. It suggested _The Crossroads Spread_, a
spread designed for moments of uncertainty, hesitation, and emotional conflict.
It consisted in five cards, _The Root_, to find out what is driving me to text
back; _Paths A & B_, the two choices of whether saying nothing or answering
back; _The Hidden Influence_, for the subconscious belief shaping my decision;
and, lastly, _The Final Outcome_, what action will bring me the most peace.

The summary of the reading was the following:

1. **The Lovers** (_The Root_) → You are standing at the edge of something that
   has already ended, still searching for a choice that no longer exists.

2. **King of Pentacles, reversed** (Ignoring the Message) → You fear that doing
   nothing means losing control, that silence is surrender rather than strength.

3. **9 of Cups, reversed** (_Responding to the Message_) → Reaching out will not
   bring satisfaction—only more longing, more emptiness, more proof that this is
   already gone.

4. **Temperance** (_The Hidden Influence_) → You are not searching for Clara—you
   are searching for balance, for inner peace, for relief from the discomfort of
   unspoken endings.

5. **The High Priestess** (_The Final Outcome_) → You already know what to do.
   Trust yourself. The only action left is no action at all.

María left. I asked her to text me when she got home. I went to bed without
replying, but unconvinced I would remain in silence.

This morning I gave myself the injection. Later, in the afternoon, I sent the
reply.

`Sof > idk if I'm back just yet, guess i was just sharing the thought out loud
with a few people. I'm not too bad. I don't hate you, but i did notice the
silence. How are you? is everything okay?`

For some reason, I do not feel now the same uneasiness about how long is going
to take before getting an answer back.
